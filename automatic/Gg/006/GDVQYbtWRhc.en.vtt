lightweight<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.150> skin<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.840> looks

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
lightweight on the skin and it looks

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.530

I find it to be fairly transfer
resistant<00:03:54.360> but<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.320> still<00:03:55.740> suggest<00:03:56.130> being

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
resistant but I still suggest being

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
resistant but I still suggest being
careful<00:03:56.910> when<00:03:57.540> you're<00:03:57.720> getting<00:03:57.870> dressed<00:03:58.320> or

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
careful when you're getting dressed or

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.680 
careful when you're getting dressed or
you<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:59.040> when<00:03:59.310> you're<00:03:59.550> around<00:04:00.090> other<00:04:00.330> people

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
you know when you're around other people

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.740 
you know when you're around other people
in<00:04:00.810> general<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:02.190> think<00:04:02.340> beige<00:04:02.940> would<00:04:03.570> be<00:04:03.720> a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
in general I think beige would be a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.780 
in general I think beige would be a
better<00:04:04.080> match<00:04:04.380> for<00:04:04.410> me<00:04:04.830> in<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.070> summer<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.610> is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
better match for me in the summer it is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.640 
better match for me in the summer it is
a<00:04:05.820> little<00:04:06.240> bit<00:04:06.480> darker<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.260> little<00:04:07.530> bit

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
a little bit darker and a little bit

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.580 
a little bit darker and a little bit
warmer<00:04:08.250> than<00:04:08.460> what<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> normally<00:04:09.300> like<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.470> I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
warmer than what I normally like and I

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.040 
warmer than what I normally like and I
am<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.770> little<00:04:11.160> bit<00:04:11.340> lighter<00:04:11.640> right<00:04:12.420> now<00:04:12.660> that

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
am a little bit lighter right now that

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.900 
am a little bit lighter right now that
getting<00:04:13.800> into<00:04:14.100> fall<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:15.530> I'm<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.680> Mac<00:04:16.890> NC<00:04:17.400> 35

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
getting into fall and I'm a Mac NC 35

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.570 
getting into fall and I'm a Mac NC 35
fish<00:04:18.359> for<00:04:18.720> reference<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.799> think<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.220> next

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
fish for reference so I think the next

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.640 
fish for reference so I think the next
shade<00:04:20.790> up<00:04:21.060> from<00:04:21.690> beige<00:04:21.930> would<00:04:22.230> be<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.380> better

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
shade up from beige would be a better

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.880 
shade up from beige would be a better
match<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:22.920> me<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.970> know<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.890> cooler

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
match for me you know in the cooler

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.790 
match for me you know in the cooler
winter<00:04:26.460> months<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.900> think<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.410> could<00:04:28.560> really

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
winter months and I think I could really

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.820 
winter months and I think I could really
use<00:04:28.890> this<00:04:29.760> base<00:04:30.060> shade<00:04:30.450> in<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:31.200> summer<00:04:31.500> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
use this base shade in the summer I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.780 
use this base shade in the summer I
think<00:04:31.860> there's<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.220> really<00:04:32.370> good<00:04:32.490> color

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
think there's a really good color

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.000 
think there's a really good color
selection<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.440> I'm<00:04:34.530> sure<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.740> lot<00:04:34.950> of

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
selection so you know I'm sure a lot of

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.250 
selection so you know I'm sure a lot of
you<00:04:35.220> could<00:04:35.370> find<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:36.030> match<00:04:36.660> for<00:04:37.080> you

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
you could find a match for you

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.070 
you could find a match for you
I<00:04:38.320> will<00:04:38.710> most<00:04:38.920> likely<00:04:39.160> transfer<00:04:39.670> some<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.540> this

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
I will most likely transfer some of this

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.770 
I will most likely transfer some of this
shaken<00:04:41.800> products<00:04:42.400> into<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.880> Mack<00:04:43.270> travel

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
heavier smell but it's not as heavy as

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.880 
heavier smell but it's not as heavy as

the oil control night treatment from
Erna<00:04:57.100> LA<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.790> use<00:04:58.030> that<00:04:58.240> night<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:59.650> it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
Erna LA so that I use that night so it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.270
