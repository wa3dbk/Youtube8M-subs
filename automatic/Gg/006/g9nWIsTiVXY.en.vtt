00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.960 
like the 29 cents price at CVS or
whatever<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:07.989> for<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:09.160> pictures<00:03:09.700> they<00:03:09.820> do

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
whatever it is for the pictures they do

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.970 
whatever it is for the pictures they do
there<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.840> does<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> decent<00:03:11.320> job<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.860> doing

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
there so it does a decent job of doing

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.360 
there so it does a decent job of doing
that<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:13.209> wouldn't<00:03:13.900> recommend<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.530> totally

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that but I wouldn't recommend it totally

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.699 
that but I wouldn't recommend it totally
for<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:15.970> you're<00:03:16.120> gonna<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.750> lot<00:03:16.930> but

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
for that if you're gonna do it a lot but

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.710 
for that if you're gonna do it a lot but
if<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.920> want<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.430> every<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:18.940> often<00:03:19.180> then

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
if you want to do it every so often then

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.949 
if you want to do it every so often then
I<00:03:20.080> would<00:03:20.200> recommend<00:03:20.890> getting<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.340> printer

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
I would recommend getting this printer

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
I would recommend getting this printer
the<00:03:22.959> only<00:03:23.260> major<00:03:23.590> disadvantage<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.970> would

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the only major disadvantage of it would

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.140 
the only major disadvantage of it would
be<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:26.470> doesn't<00:03:26.620> include<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.310> USB<00:03:27.519> printer

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
be it doesn't include a USB printer

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.539 
be it doesn't include a USB printer
cable<00:03:28.480> which<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.049> necessary<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.890> the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
cable which is necessary to the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.390 
cable which is necessary to the
operation<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.390> printer<00:03:31.810> which<00:03:32.799> basically

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
operation of the printer which basically

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680 
operation of the printer which basically
it<00:03:33.670> connects<00:03:33.970> from<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.330> back<00:03:34.480> your

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
it connects from to the back your

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.930 
it connects from to the back your
computer<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.500> then<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.370> connect<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
computer and then you just connect it to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.820 
computer and then you just connect it to
the<00:03:37.030> printer<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.780> provides<00:03:38.230> like<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
the printer and that provides like the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.009 
the printer and that provides like the
information<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:40.330> flow<00:03:40.540> between<00:03:40.750> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
information the flow between the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.070 
information the flow between the
computer<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.680> printer<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.840> not

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
computer and the printer it's not

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.570 
computer and the printer it's not
included<00:03:44.380> in<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.860> package

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
included in the package

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.550 
included in the package
so<00:03:45.970> you're<00:03:46.239> gonna<00:03:46.330> have<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.570> buy<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.380> use

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
so you're gonna have to buy it to use

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.350 
so you're gonna have to buy it to use
your<00:03:47.769> printer<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.489> you'd<00:03:48.610> have<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.850> go<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.090> your

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360
