00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
gonna be a support

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.199 
gonna be a support
person<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.129> that's<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:14.879> gonna<00:02:15.000> do

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
person and that's all I'm gonna do

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.910 
person and that's all I'm gonna do
pretty<00:02:15.390> much<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.870> need<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.349> make<00:02:16.500> sure<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
pretty much I need to make sure that I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.309 
pretty much I need to make sure that I
master<00:02:17.489> every<00:02:17.970> single<00:02:18.299> support<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> game

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
master every single support in the game

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.320 
master every single support in the game
so<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.739> can<00:02:19.830> counter<00:02:20.459> people<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.060> work

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so I can counter people so I can work

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.660 
so I can counter people so I can work
well<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:21.599> my<00:02:21.930> ad<00:02:22.140> carry<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
well with my ad carry so that's what I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.220 
well with my ad carry so that's what I
did<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.940> ended<00:02:24.299> up<00:02:24.360> spending<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.049> money

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
did I ended up spending a lot of money

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
did I ended up spending a lot of money
within<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> first<00:02:25.920> two<00:02:26.159> weeks<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.580> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
within the first two weeks but I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.399 
within the first two weeks but I
honestly<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.209> don't<00:02:27.330> regret<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.019> love<00:02:28.260> this

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
honestly I don't regret it I love this

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.069 
honestly I don't regret it I love this
game<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.489> think<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.819> game<00:02:30.030> deserves<00:02:30.780> to

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
game and I think the game deserves to

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.690 
game and I think the game deserves to
have<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.560> amount<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.920> money<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.370> have

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
have the amount of money that I have

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.869 
have the amount of money that I have
given<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:33.629> that's<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.879> my

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
given them so that's my that's my

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.390 
given them so that's my that's my
validation<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.049> spending<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:38.129> much<00:02:38.370> money

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
validation for spending that much money

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
validation for spending that much money
on<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.849> free-to-play<00:02:39.390> game<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.709> just

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
support and it's actually a really

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.069 
support and it's actually a really
important<00:02:53.700> role<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.599> have<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> good

learning I'm also learning to mid lane I
decided<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.690> all<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.989> other<00:03:43.139> roles

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
decided that out of all the other roles

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.710 
decided that out of all the other roles
that<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.829> could<00:03:44.069> do<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.430> want<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.940> learn<00:03:45.090> mid<00:03:45.510> lane

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
that I could do I want to learn mid lane

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.420 
that I could do I want to learn mid lane
I<00:03:45.870> feel<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.379> is<00:03:46.590> another<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.370> I

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
I feel like that is another one that I

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.400 
I feel like that is another one that I
would<00:03:47.579> feel<00:03:47.730> most<00:03:48.090> comfortable<00:03:48.389> with<00:03:48.750> over<00:03:49.230> 80

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
would feel most comfortable with over 80

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.520 
would feel most comfortable with over 80
carry<00:03:49.769> over<00:03:50.099> top<00:03:50.370> over<00:03:50.609> jungle<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.419> also<00:03:52.109> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
carry over top over jungle and also the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.349 
carry over top over jungle and also the
reason<00:03:52.919> that<00:03:52.980> I'm<00:03:53.129> doing<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.699> because<00:03:54.120> it

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
reason that I'm doing it is because it

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.720 
reason that I'm doing it is because it
is<00:03:54.599> damn<00:03:55.079> near<00:03:55.349> impossible<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:56.010> carry<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.489> game

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
is damn near impossible to carry a game

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.599 
is damn near impossible to carry a game
as<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.720> support<00:03:58.230> if<00:03:58.379> your<00:03:58.530> team<00:03:58.949> is<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
as a support if your team is not the

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.339 
as a support if your team is not the
greatest<00:04:00.000> there's<00:04:00.449> not<00:04:00.690> much<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.230> do

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
greatest there's not much you can do

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.129 
greatest there's not much you can do
except<00:04:01.919> try<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.879> have<00:04:03.180> them<00:04:03.480> not<00:04:03.510> die<00:04:04.079> and

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
except try and have them not die and

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.400 
except try and have them not die and
less<00:04:04.500> as<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.489> support<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.840> thought<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.260> as

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
less as the support so I thought that as

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.229 
less as the support so I thought that as
a<00:04:07.440> mid<00:04:07.769> laner<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.099> could<00:04:08.370> carry<00:04:08.609> games<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:09.030> little

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
a mid laner I could carry games a little

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.020 
a mid laner I could carry games a little
bit<00:04:09.540> easier<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.260> try<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.040> get<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.879> low

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
bit easier and try and get out of a low

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.509 
bit easier and try and get out of a low
hell<00:04:12.389> in<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.750> ranked<00:04:13.620> games<00:04:13.859> because<00:04:14.280> all<00:04:14.489> I

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
hell in my ranked games because all I

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.370 
hell in my ranked games because all I
seem<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.060> get<00:04:15.180> our<00:04:15.329> trolls<00:04:15.690> or<00:04:16.049> just<00:04:16.079> people

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
single champion do support I thought

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.689 
single champion do support I thought
that<00:06:03.659> would<00:06:03.780> be<00:06:03.930> really<00:06:04.259> cool<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.680> do<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.400> that
