00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
have a very strong team but it how

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.979 
have a very strong team but it how
important<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.840> at<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.199> team<00:00:50.410> jail<00:00:50.859> well<00:00:51.100> I

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
important is it at the team jail well I

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.599 
important is it at the team jail well I
think<00:00:52.989> our<00:00:53.379> sport<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:54.070> particular<00:00:54.340> is

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
think our sport in particular is

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.209 
think our sport in particular is
incredibly<00:00:55.030> difficult<00:00:55.239> for<00:00:56.140> we<00:00:57.010> call

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
incredibly difficult for we call

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.889 
incredibly difficult for we call
ourselves<00:00:57.370> athletes<00:00:58.149> but<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:58.539> suppose<00:00:58.780> you

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
ourselves athletes but I suppose you

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.279 
ourselves athletes but I suppose you
can't<00:00:59.140> compare<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.679> to<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.920> rugby<00:01:00.100> player<00:01:00.280> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
can't compare that to a rugby player and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.750 
can't compare that to a rugby player and
they<00:01:02.289> have<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.530> very<00:01:02.769> difficult<00:01:03.100> job<00:01:03.399> they

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
they have a very difficult job they

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.840 
they have a very difficult job they
compete<00:01:04.480> against<00:01:04.870> each<00:01:04.930> other<00:01:05.820> every<00:01:06.820> day

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
compete against each other every day

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.130 
compete against each other every day
every<00:01:07.660> weekend<00:01:08.140> until<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:09.460> championship<00:01:10.060> team

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
every weekend until a championship team

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.760 
every weekend until a championship team
competition<00:01:11.140> which<00:01:11.860> happens<00:01:12.160> once<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.520> year

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
competition which happens once a year

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.550 
competition which happens once a year
you<00:01:14.770> then<00:01:15.010> have<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.610> turn<00:01:16.110> turn<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.290> sort<00:01:17.470> of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
you then have to turn turn the sort of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.310 
you then have to turn turn the sort of
tables<00:01:18.340> around<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.940> say<00:01:19.090> by<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.600> way<00:01:19.780> now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
tables around and say by the way now

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.740 
tables around and say by the way now
we're<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.500> team<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.130> they<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.180> very<00:01:22.540> short

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
we're a team and they have a very short

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.110 
we're a team and they have a very short
space<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.140> time<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:24.160> become<00:01:24.310> accustomed<00:01:24.700> to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
space of time to become accustomed to

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.990 
space of time to become accustomed to
that<00:01:25.270> role<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:26.890> think<00:01:27.190> perhaps<00:01:27.430> because

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
that role and I think perhaps because

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.250 
that role and I think perhaps because
I've<00:01:28.120> been<00:01:28.150> brought<00:01:28.420> up<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.660> Pony<00:01:29.050> Club

accustomed<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.150> difficult<00:01:34.150> situation

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
accustomed to that difficult situation

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.610 
accustomed to that difficult situation
and<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.620> can<00:01:35.830> only<00:01:35.980> admire<00:01:36.310> them<00:01:36.580> for<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.620> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
and I can only admire them for the the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.530 
and I can only admire them for the the
change<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.400> they<00:01:39.490> have<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.790> make<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.360> order

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
change that they have to make in order

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.670 
change that they have to make in order
to<00:01:42.180> culminate<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.360> as<00:01:43.510> a<00:01:43.570> team<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.260> it's<00:01:44.530> not

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
to culminate it as a team so it's not

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.340 
to culminate it as a team so it's not
it's<00:01:44.920> not<00:01:44.980> easy<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.850> they've<00:01:46.090> come<00:01:46.420> through

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it's not easy but they've come through

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.410 
it's not easy but they've come through
the<00:01:47.470> ranks<00:01:47.500> they<00:01:48.160> know<00:01:48.340> what<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.030> job's<00:01:49.270> about

sure they're all well prepared for it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.099 
sure they're all well prepared for it
there<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.130> well<00:03:34.700> prepared<00:03:34.910> as<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.690> could

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
there is a well prepared as we could

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.500 
there is a well prepared as we could
have<00:03:36.230> possibly<00:03:36.410> done<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.280> far<00:03:37.549> there's<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.359> lot

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
have possibly done so far there's a lot

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.949 
have possibly done so far there's a lot
of<00:03:38.540> work<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.989> do<00:03:39.109> now<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:41.120> think<00:03:41.600> that's<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
of work to do now and I think that's the

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.550 
of work to do now and I think that's the
focus<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.590> well<00:03:43.280> done<00:03:43.489> you've<00:03:43.970> been<00:03:44.180> selected

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.009 
focus is well done you've been selected
fantastic<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:45.829> now<00:03:46.100> we<00:03:46.579> need<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.940> work<00:03:47.150> we've

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
fantastic but now we need to work we've

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.470 
fantastic but now we need to work we've
got<00:03:48.260> another<00:03:48.560> month<00:03:48.890> before<00:03:49.299> cross<00:03:50.299> country

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
got another month before cross country

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.130 
got another month before cross country
day<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:52.000> there's<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.060> lot<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.269> work<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.959> can

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
be done between them and then so that's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.199 
be done between them and then so that's
the<00:03:56.239> focus<00:03:56.420> now<00:03:56.950> jinnat<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.190> are<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.489> four-time
