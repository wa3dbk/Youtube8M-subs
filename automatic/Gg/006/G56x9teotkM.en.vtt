00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
smaller bag has this flap here and the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
smaller bag has this flap here and the
bigger<00:01:18.900> size<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:20.070> has<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.400> zipper<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
bigger size one just has one zipper so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
bigger size one just has one zipper so
the<00:01:21.330> bigger<00:01:21.540> size<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.380> can't<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:23.070> inside

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the bigger size one you can't see inside

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240 
the bigger size one you can't see inside
as<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.110> doesn't<00:01:25.380> open<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:26.009> wide

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
as much and it doesn't open as wide

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
as much and it doesn't open as wide
that's<00:01:26.759> why<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.570> shape<00:01:28.110> but
