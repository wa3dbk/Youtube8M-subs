my theory that guy is free like a baby

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.730 
my theory that guy is free like a baby
because<00:02:28.940> he<00:02:29.209> shaped<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> baby<00:02:30.020> yes<00:02:30.470> she's

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
because he shaped like a baby yes she's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.410 
because he shaped like a baby yes she's
just<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.010> cutest<00:02:31.610> body<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:33.520> yeah<00:02:34.520> I've<00:02:34.880> never

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
just the cutest body and yeah I've never

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.449 
just the cutest body and yeah I've never
seen<00:02:35.870> someone<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.500> more<00:02:36.650> free<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.310> was<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
seen someone just more free there was a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.810 
seen someone just more free there was a
woman<00:02:38.030> at<00:02:38.270> MADtv<00:02:38.900> who<00:02:39.650> was<00:02:39.830> hired<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.520> be<00:02:40.640> his

woman at MADtv who was hired to be his
naked<00:02:41.330> Wrangler<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.110> think<00:02:42.709> mostly<00:02:43.100> for

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
naked Wrangler I think mostly for

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
lawsuits because that dude we had a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.260 
lawsuits because that dude we had a
ping-pong<00:02:45.980> table<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.760> would<00:02:46.880> play<00:02:46.970> ping

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
ping-pong table and we would play ping

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.510 
ping-pong table and we would play ping
pong<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.959> he<00:02:48.650> would<00:02:48.770> just<00:02:48.800> get<00:02:49.130> crazy

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
pong and like he would just get crazy

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.910 
pong and like he would just get crazy
