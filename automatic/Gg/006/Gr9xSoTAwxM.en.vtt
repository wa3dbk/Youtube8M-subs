00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.639 
take advantage while you still can I'm
pretty<00:01:10.950> sure<00:01:11.869> with<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.899> fit<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.409> things

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
pretty sure with the fit way things

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.050 
pretty sure with the fit way things
already<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> drop<00:01:14.759> rate<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
already now I think the drop rate is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.959 
already now I think the drop rate is
going<00:01:15.149> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.360> nerfed<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.719> bit<00:01:15.899> i<00:01:16.880> myself<00:01:17.880> need

that as well so what the hell is wrong

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
that as well so what the hell is wrong
with<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.299> spider<00:01:31.250> um<00:01:32.250> okay<00:01:32.909> let's<00:01:33.570> let's<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
with my spider um okay let's let's just

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.060 
with my spider um okay let's let's just
ignore<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.820> spider<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.359> little<00:01:36.750> bit

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
ignore that my spider was a little bit

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
ignore that my spider was a little bit
just<00:01:38.090> acting<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.409> bit

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just acting a bit it's a little bit

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.300 
just acting a bit it's a little bit
unexpected<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.619> drop<00:01:43.829> rate<00:01:43.859> is<00:01:44.130> pretty

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
unexpected so the drop rate is pretty

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.209 
unexpected so the drop rate is pretty
good<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.789> i<00:01:44.909> said<00:01:45.179> i<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.320> migrated<00:01:47.009> pen

it didn't kill me so that's that um I
don't<00:03:24.010> think<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.610> drop<00:03:25.090> rate<00:03:25.240> of<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> boxes

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
don't think the drop rate of the boxes

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.949 
don't think the drop rate of the boxes
will<00:03:26.170> be<00:03:26.290> nerfed<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:28.180> coin<00:03:28.540> rate<00:03:28.780> from

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
will be nerfed but the coin rate from

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.440 
will be nerfed but the coin rate from
the<00:03:29.020> boxes<00:03:29.590> might<00:03:30.070> be<00:03:30.250> nerve<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.610> as<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.240> right

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the boxes might be nerve and as of right

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.390 
the boxes might be nerve and as of right
now<00:03:31.480> i'm<00:03:31.750> not<00:03:32.080> sure<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:32.590> there's<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.860> limit<00:03:33.250> on

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
now i'm not sure if there's a limit on

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.980 
now i'm not sure if there's a limit on
how<00:03:33.490> many<00:03:33.790> coins<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.150> could<00:03:34.330> get<00:03:34.450> from<00:03:34.540> boxes

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990

but let's go ahead and check I have 16
right<00:04:04.830> now<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:07.500> after<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.950> stage<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.430> should

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
right now so after this stage we should

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
right now so after this stage we should
have<00:04:08.820> 17<00:04:10.070> okay<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.400> incorrect<00:04:12.890> so<00:04:13.890> I'm

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
have 17 okay that is incorrect so I'm

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:24.770 
have 17 okay that is incorrect so I'm
going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.130> keep<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.430> open<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:15.000> case
