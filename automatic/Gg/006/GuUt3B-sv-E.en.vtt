00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good two drops on your boots and 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.310
 until the daily video I'm here 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.649
 how are you seeing with black ops 2 yes 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.120
 gentlemen and you will say this game me the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.000
 I was waiting because well, because the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 another day his nuclear life with the piper 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 just the necessary day of the face 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 Well, it seems to me that it came out 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 night then the next day you had 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 so I said nothing come here if we arrived 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.869
 in that 2000 nuclear like he argued 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 this double nuclear in the target these 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.789
 with mp7 which is not that it is here of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 the arms slapped to me to my liking is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 that are a submachine gun and it's easier 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.630
 easy for that but still it does not reach us 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 to be a mmc or a per wat to this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.309
 I want abyss that you make 22 cristian 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.350
 as I would say today consume that you give us 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.270
 seeing there the failures with the knife 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 you will see a partner throwing a cable 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.950
 as you are seeing we were only four in 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.840
 the team having a life so 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 there were so to speak two guiris or two 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 people who did not know anything about me 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.739
 team and in the other position that is what 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 they went in there because someone left 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 the many schatz let you upload them 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 pull because if you look 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.159
 What I'm doing is what I'm doing. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.689
 a v6 and he threw it and directly table 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.939
 consequently because if they did not bend me 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.430
 you will see it on all the second nuclear 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.200
 it is more more colorful as you are seeing 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 right there, waiting for the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 insertions then after champion to you 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.210
 angry, yes you had to ensure that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670
 low and the truth is that I did not expect 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 and get me out is this double nullity 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 because you want me not to have never gone in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.820
 this case in the wagener keep three yes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.180
 you have tried three times already you know 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 I have two more triples and several 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.039
 doubles more I have enough I do not know if at 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.810
 better is between 20 or there is there but 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.929
 many are with doing while trying 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.850
 the triple but good after I do not have no 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.590
 I had none and this is the first I do not know 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.229
 yes on YouTube of many Spanish 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.840
 there will be double fashions as much I have 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.940
 seen a couple I think of subscribers 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.679
 what happened to me that they saw out there is that 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.990
 well I can show off so to speak 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.340
 to be one of the first Spaniards to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 they bring a double nuclear the two triples 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 nuclear, yes, I've seen some guiri 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 it seems to me that I have only seen one more 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540
 in no Spanish has I seen to see if 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.580
 I get it yes yes let's try to finish me 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 putting that triple nuclear that good 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 trying in the domain you will say some 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 uncle bis not this is easier because it is 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.610
 good demolition we will tell you that it is more 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.170
 easy on the subject of how good you have a 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.030
 tad more time if you know 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.250
 organize and raise it well you know 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.430
 bombs to lose a round win the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.310
 another digital one but good if you look at the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.830
 be less people so you're going to happen in 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.989
 at least in front of each certain 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.880
 time then more are going to be longer 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.530
 the nuclear then there is certain 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.260
 advantage on the one hand and a certain disadvantage 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.860
 for another and good as it is to be seeing 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'm going to be the sponge in the sponge's 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.640
 this good of this game basically 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.700
 is to pick up a bunch of times they let me 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 reddish many times and is typical 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 moment in which we go in this case and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.130
 as long as they have a putty shot and 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.420
 I am already killed as you see this 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.250
 kissed I do not even know why I throw it 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.200
 practically in gives me just a couple of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.000
 lower more but as you can see I'm already 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.590
 bending is shooting clouds to you I'm doubled 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.480
 the next one or it's good to get the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.870
 next so pretty well are you 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.069
 seeing that already practically 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 I'll kill streak saw 25 or 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.260
 get right now and got brutal 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.480
 court of 25 so we only had 5 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.819
 more is looking forward to the end and the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.530
 round to go to the other side because 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.870
 this you see that they were starting to come out 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.360
 everyone quickly and well this one 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.920
 I have to kill and we go to the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.409
 following the next round the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.090
 next when I put it faster 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.829
 because if we are not going to do this well 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.500
 eternal play and you will see that already inside 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.620
 I'm not going to take anything out of this nuclear 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.780
 that drew us Juan and the other day the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.660
 I went up the vais to see now he has the c4 and 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.760
 foam and they will be nuclear that's the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.049
 first it took me out now it seems to me some 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.370
 four casualties or something like that and then what 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.290
 you will see at the end that I will put the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.420
 medals that I got but we already passed 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.220
 to the next court and as you see we are going 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.980
 to start with a triple low with the c4 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.409
 yes gentlemen so you can start some 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.359
 gusts but well and with these spirits 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.599
 like this triple low anybody gets out 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.250
 a nuclear one so quickly and good 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.630
 I just wanted to thank also 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.639
 the good ones to those who were in this 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 page that as you know will be good they were 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.939
 subscribers because it was in my account 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.650
 secondary 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:25.990
 and it's still going back, you can 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.060
 add him it's called seek oops him me 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.490
 He said recently tells me good to go 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.319
 go up to level 55 for good to play 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.030
 a little bit also with you already know 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.889
 that I will have a little bit because I will erase you 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.189
 all of me would add new people so that 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.900
 everyone can enjoy playing with me 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.699
 and good more things that I wanted to tell you 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.259
 as you are seeing is to survive 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.419
 many explosions and it's because I was 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.430
 using bulletproof vest or if I 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.810
 it seems that it was as soon as it was not 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.539
 be used a lot in this game 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.819
 but come on, it seems imperative that 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.710
 it is worn by the best hard and ghost line 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.080
 but in this case already hard line without 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.060
 bulletproof vest because good 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.129
 because practically here you always 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.169
 they are throwing that nonsense and you 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.050
 if you take but to vd answer then 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.930
 you practically have good does not make you 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.610
 the ghost is missing so much and it's good 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.960
 that's why I was wearing it 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.759
 Take the car full as you are seeing 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.740
 to have more ammunition and not get caught 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.300
 ground weapons and also wore 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.979
 practical mask because I think 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.620
 practically indispensable that or 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.529
 dexterity and good you are already seeing there 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.569
 I doubled the data again so be it 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.979
 could have pulled out the nuclear triple 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.559
 Well, yes, but it seems to me 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.819
 I was on a streak of 10 it seems to me already 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:38.019
 you will see at the end I have already told you that 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:40.779
 I will expose the good scores and nothing 

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:43.979
 I always always like to do this 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:47.649
 always standard those that are more than 6 to 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.719
 June 56 minutes , but one had promised 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:51.429
 they were going to bring it since many 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:53.469
 you are waiting for me to bring the uat more 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:54.969
 but I do not know is that it is the gameplay itself 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:57.159
 it's 15 minutes when you pay attention to this 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.019
 moment that I do not even know how and that 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.329
 typical sense to the moment in which you 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.129
 they leave reddish mistrata is a tad and now 

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:05.079
 you end up killing but in this case 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.519
 it happened to me I already had a luck 

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:09.009
 incredible good what was being 

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:11.289
 saying of which to see if one day 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.749
 avis does not want to bring us that when 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.639
 whom he presumes and never attracts 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:17.259
 to see if in the end it's going to look like 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.479
 this is a lie and you do not have that which 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.249
 good fashion yes yes I have it saved like this 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.079
 to see if one day because I think 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.029
 someone like to tell who to know 

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:27.069
 because I have between exams and to see 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.629
 if I wear this weekend and neither 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:32.459
 I promise nothing because you always finished 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:34.479
 failing by in theory 

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.949
 failed because he had promised that 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.189
 just when he arrived the next day 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.019
 I would bring it to you and well here you have it 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.839
 that I would like nothing to finish 

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:45.639
 because it will not be long before you vote 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:48.399
 is the video about everything and if you can 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.019
 pass then to your colleagues and friends 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:52.110
 this game so that they could 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.580
 enjoy and to whom not many people 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.489
 comment that comments in Spanish have 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.559
 a nuclear double in this new case 

00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:01.449
 city ​​and you know that they treat you more things 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:03.819
 to see if I get nuclear with all 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.589
 all your rifles to start and then 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:07.449
 I will bring you to see if he took me some 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.729
 double or whoever leaves a triple beam 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.379
 all attentive to me now is there 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.629
 let rockies girl as if it were a 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:16.509
 sponge I did not believe it anymore it's always me 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.129
 they kill nothing of the nuclear and good 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.659

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.529
