00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
rather than keeping up remand just

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.870 
rather than keeping up remand just
because<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.750> think<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.110> thinking<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
because I think I was just thinking that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.450 
because I think I was just thinking that
we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> win<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> match<00:01:18.479> then

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.029 
pretty quickly he plays out on
expedition<00:01:33.609> map<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:36.179> passes<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.210> turn<00:01:38.039> she

it turn she does to remount now which is
pretty<00:01:43.689> nice<00:01:44.219> so<00:01:45.219> even<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.549> you<00:01:45.640> can<00:01:45.789> play

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
pretty nice so even if you can play

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.059 
pretty nice so even if you can play
massive<00:01:46.329> things<00:01:46.539> then<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:48.250> not<00:01:48.520> irrelevant

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
massive things then it's not irrelevant

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.589

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
which is really nice for us because we

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.499 
which is really nice for us because we
obviously<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.289> remand<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:58.450> he

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
obviously can remand it and if he

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.550 
obviously can remand it and if he
doesn't<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.990> another<00:01:59.140> way<00:01:59.289> to<00:01:59.349> generate

doesn't have another way to generate
green<00:01:59.950> manner<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.399> he<00:02:00.459> just<00:02:00.929> has<00:02:01.929> that<00:02:01.959> stuck

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
green manner and he just has that stuck

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.749 
green manner and he just has that stuck
in<00:02:02.379> his<00:02:02.469> hand<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.420> what<00:02:04.659> happens<00:02:05.759> we

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
in his hand which is what happens we

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.309 
in his hand which is what happens we
draw<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.000> trap<00:02:07.239> estimate<00:02:07.659> which<00:02:07.869> we<00:02:08.049> put<00:02:08.229> on

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
draw in trap estimate which we put on

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.550 
draw in trap estimate which we put on
top<00:02:10.680> so<00:02:11.680> we<00:02:11.799> just<00:02:11.920> passed<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.220> turn<00:02:13.440> next<00:02:14.440> time

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.050 
just to keep in low on mana the only
thing<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.410> can<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:29.709> see<00:02:30.010> as<00:02:30.400> an<00:02:30.579> out<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.910> him

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
thing I can really see as an out for him

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.809 
thing I can really see as an out for him
I<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:32.410> think<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.799> would<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.370> play<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.549> card

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
I can think of would be to play a card

I can think of would be to play a card
in<00:02:34.150> exile<00:02:34.930> one<00:02:35.139> of<00:02:35.230> our<00:02:35.319> lands<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:38.019> think<00:02:38.739> if

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
in exile one of our lands so I think if

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.940 
in exile one of our lands so I think if
we<00:02:39.099> can<00:02:39.250> keep<00:02:39.400> him<00:02:40.049> potentially<00:02:41.049> lower<00:02:41.440> low

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
we can keep him potentially lower low

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.699 
we can keep him potentially lower low
