00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.020 

kumamoto<00:03:00.840> rest<00:03:01.340> nothing<00:03:02.340> pretty<00:03:02.549> here<00:03:02.819> but

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
kumamoto rest nothing pretty here but

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.630 
kumamoto rest nothing pretty here but
starting<00:03:03.780> looked<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.080> ball<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.560> guess<00:03:05.430> it's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
starting looked like a ball I guess it's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.030 
starting looked like a ball I guess it's
a<00:03:05.730> rough<00:03:05.909> out<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.390> don't<00:03:06.540> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> spend<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
a rough out so I don't want to spend a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.440 
a rough out so I don't want to spend a
lot<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.220> time<00:03:08.340> making<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.940> outside<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.360> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
lot of time making the outside of it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:33.910 
lot of time making the outside of it
perfect<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.590> no<00:03:10.739> fight

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.479 

that's<00:03:34.920> basically<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.489> outside<00:03:35.910> shape<00:03:36.209> here

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that's basically the outside shape here

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.070 
that's basically the outside shape here
again<00:03:38.489> adjust<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.030> front<00:03:39.360> edge<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.840> flat

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
again adjust this front edge is not flat

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.180 
again adjust this front edge is not flat
so<00:03:40.230> I'm<00:03:40.319> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.530> clean<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.830> up<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.129> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
so I'm going to clean that up with a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:05:09.270 
so I'm going to clean that up with a
plunge<00:03:41.459> cut<00:03:41.550> like<00:03:41.849> this

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.550

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
there's a third that are out here but i

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.200 
there's a third that are out here but i
