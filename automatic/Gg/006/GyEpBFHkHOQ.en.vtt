you guys out there who have a ps4 or an

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.909 
you guys out there who have a ps4 or an
Xbox<00:00:20.630> one<00:00:21.050> because<00:00:21.320> it'll<00:00:21.529> work<00:00:21.619> with<00:00:21.800> either

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
Xbox one because it'll work with either

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.450 
Xbox one because it'll work with either
one<00:00:22.599> and<00:00:23.599> you<00:00:23.749> want<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.140> use<00:00:24.589> it<00:00:24.769> on<00:00:24.949> a<00:00:24.980> old

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
one and you want to use it on a old

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.519 
one and you want to use it on a old
stereo<00:00:26.329> amplifier<00:00:26.960> that<00:00:27.259> uses<00:00:27.679> RCA<00:00:28.189> plugs

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
stereo amplifier that uses RCA plugs

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.499 
stereo amplifier that uses RCA plugs
because<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.560> lot<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:31.070> older<00:00:31.460> amplifiers<00:00:32.090> use

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
because a lot of older amplifiers use

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.130 
because a lot of older amplifiers use
the<00:00:32.719> red<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:33.350> white<00:00:34.340> left<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.390> right<00:00:35.570> RCA

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the red and white left and right RCA

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.459 
the red and white left and right RCA
plugs<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.280> Xbox<00:00:38.030> one<00:00:38.449> and<00:00:38.480> ps4<00:00:38.840> neither

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
plugs and the Xbox one and ps4 neither

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.610 
plugs and the Xbox one and ps4 neither
one<00:00:39.770> support<00:00:40.510> regular<00:00:41.510> stereo<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.469> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
one support regular stereo right and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.200 
one support regular stereo right and
left

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
left

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.110 
left
RCA<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.920> have<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.250> buy<00:00:46.340> converter<00:00:46.850> like

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
RCA so you have to buy converter like

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.779 
RCA so you have to buy converter like
this<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:50.059> use<00:00:50.719> your<00:00:51.050> old<00:00:51.289> amplifiers<00:00:51.769> or<00:00:52.460> old

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
this to use your old amplifiers or old

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.349 
this to use your old amplifiers or old
stereo<00:00:53.329> systems<00:00:53.809> with<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.949> new<00:00:55.359> technology

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
stereo systems with the new technology

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.580 
stereo systems with the new technology
so<00:00:56.539> I'm<00:00:56.629> going<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.809> show<00:00:56.929> you<00:00:56.960> guys<00:00:57.140> what<00:00:57.440> this

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
the box I actually wasn't expecting it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.720 
the box I actually wasn't expecting it
to<00:01:15.950> come<00:01:16.100> in<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.250> box<00:01:16.430> ordered<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.970> off<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.270> ebay

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
paid about 13 dollars for this thing

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.110 
paid about 13 dollars for this thing
between<00:01:23.450> 13<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:23.900> 14<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.580> bit<00:01:25.760> pricey

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
this is a really high quality device and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.960 
this is a really high quality device and
I'm<00:01:31.070> going<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.250> go<00:01:31.310> ahead<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:31.550> show<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.850> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
so like I said this is the box that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.550 
so like I said this is the box that
comes<00:01:34.220> with<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.110> converter

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
comes with and here is the converter

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.350 
comes with and here is the converter
itself<00:01:38.320> it's<00:01:39.320> extremely<00:01:40.130> heavy<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.670> it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
itself it's extremely heavy and it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.920 
itself it's extremely heavy and it's
made<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.900> steel<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.680> meat<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:44.390> entire

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
made of steel it is meat this entire

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.110 
made of steel it is meat this entire
thing<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.380> metal<00:01:45.860> there's<00:01:46.190> no<00:01:46.460> plastic<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:47.060> it

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
thing is metal there's no plastic on it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.660 
thing is metal there's no plastic on it
except<00:01:47.510> for<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.780> little<00:01:47.990> plug<00:01:48.230> right<00:01:48.410> here<00:01:48.670> so

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
except for the little plug right here so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.910 
except for the little plug right here so
you<00:01:49.730> have<00:01:49.910> your<00:01:50.000> toss<00:01:50.270> link<00:01:50.600> your<00:01:51.110> coax<00:01:51.560> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
you have your toss link your coax and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460 
you have your toss link your coax and
your<00:01:52.040> power<00:01:52.250> indicator<00:01:52.700> LED<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:54.230> you<00:01:54.320> can

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
your power indicator LED so you can

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.700 
your power indicator LED so you can
convert<00:01:54.770> coax<00:01:55.280> or<00:01:55.610> Toslink<00:01:56.350> digital<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.530> mean

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
convert coax or Toslink digital I mean

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.540 
convert coax or Toslink digital I mean

RCA<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:03.440> thing<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:04.070> does<00:02:04.970> require<00:02:05.680> power

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
RCA this thing is does require power

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.089 
RCA this thing is does require power
from<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.280> plug<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.060> does<00:02:08.209> require<00:02:08.479> AC<00:02:08.780> power<00:02:09.140> it

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
from a plug it does require AC power it

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.440 
from a plug it does require AC power it
has<00:02:10.219> a<00:02:10.250> DC<00:02:11.650> converting<00:02:12.650> power

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
has a DC converting power

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.020 
has a DC converting power
why<00:02:13.860> here's<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> power<00:02:15.220> supply<00:02:15.580> basically

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
why here's the power supply basically

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.330 
why here's the power supply basically
looks<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.780> glorified<00:02:17.319> cellphone<00:02:17.980> power

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
looks like a glorified cellphone power

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.780 
looks like a glorified cellphone power
supply<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:19.300> DC<00:02:19.780> five<00:02:20.050> volts<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.610> only

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
supply that's DC five volts the only

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
supply that's DC five volts the only
thing<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.239> package<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.690> actually

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
thing in the package that actually

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.630 
thing in the package that actually
doesn't<00:02:23.230> feel<00:02:23.500> high-quality<00:02:24.099> actually<00:02:24.519> is

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
doesn't feel high-quality actually is

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.070 
doesn't feel high-quality actually is
the<00:02:24.819> power<00:02:25.030> supply<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.540> see<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.840> five

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the power supply you can see if five

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.470 
the power supply you can see if five
volts<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:27.280> standard<00:02:27.640> old<00:02:27.819> power<00:02:28.060> supply

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
volts just a standard old power supply

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120 
volts just a standard old power supply
it's<00:02:28.660> got<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.810> green<00:02:29.200> light<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.739> back<00:02:29.890> there

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
it's got a green light on it back there

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.759 
it's got a green light on it back there
and<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> power<00:02:31.720> supply<00:02:31.780> sucked<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.470> this

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
and when the power supply sucked up this

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.940 
and when the power supply sucked up this
little<00:02:33.630> LED<00:02:34.630> power<00:02:34.989> indicator<00:02:35.349> light<00:02:35.620> will

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
little LED power indicator light will

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.520 
little LED power indicator light will
glow<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.360> basically<00:02:37.720> how<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.870> use<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.319> thing

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
glow so basically how to use this thing

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.979 
glow so basically how to use this thing
it's<00:02:38.709> very<00:02:38.860> simple<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.209> do<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.959> just

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
it's very simple what you do is you just

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.619 
it's very simple what you do is you just
take<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.590> includes<00:02:42.370> what<00:02:42.790> what<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.150> included

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
take it includes what what is included

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.580 
take it includes what what is included
with<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:45.190> adapter<00:02:45.970> itself<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
with this is the adapter itself the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.199 
with this is the adapter itself the
power<00:02:47.799> supply<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:50.790> optical<00:02:51.790> audio<00:02:52.000> cable

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
power supply and a optical audio cable

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.970 
power supply and a optical audio cable
that's<00:02:52.690> about<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.959> foot<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.349> half<00:02:53.470> long<00:02:53.530> I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
that's about a foot and a half long I

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.620 
that's about a foot and a half long I
don't<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.519> only<00:02:54.700> thing<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.940> don't<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.269> here

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
don't the only thing I don't have here

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.360 
don't the only thing I don't have here
to<00:02:55.720> show<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> actual<00:02:56.530> optical<00:02:57.250> audio

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to show you is the actual optical audio

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.339 
to show you is the actual optical audio
cable<00:02:57.579> because<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.360> plugged<00:02:58.599> into<00:02:58.750> my<00:02:58.840> xbox

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
cable because it's plugged into my xbox

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.600 
cable because it's plugged into my xbox
right<00:02:59.620> now

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
right now

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
right now
but<00:03:01.090> basically<00:03:01.299> what<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.290> take

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
but basically what you do is you take

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.039 
but basically what you do is you take
the<00:03:03.220> optical<00:03:04.120> cable<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.630> hook<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.930> your

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
the optical cable and hook it to your

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.979 
the optical cable and hook it to your
Xbox<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.739> then<00:03:05.860> plug<00:03:06.099> it<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.549> end

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
Xbox and then plug it into this end

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.360 
Xbox and then plug it into this end
hookup<00:03:07.989> power<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.890> then<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.130> run

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
hookup power to it and then you run

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
hookup power to it and then you run
these<00:03:09.579> two<00:03:09.849> back<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.599> your<00:03:10.750> amplifier<00:03:10.930> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
these two back to your amplifier and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.259 
these two back to your amplifier and
there<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.829> go<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:12.430> run<00:03:12.610> stereo<00:03:13.060> audio

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
there you go you can run stereo audio

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.490 
there you go you can run stereo audio
through<00:03:13.840> your<00:03:14.709> Xbox<00:03:15.519> one<00:03:15.790> or<00:03:15.819> ps4<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.870> it'll

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
through your Xbox one or ps4 and it'll

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.559 
through your Xbox one or ps4 and it'll
work<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.739> fine<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.910> only<00:03:19.090> issue<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.359> have

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
work just fine the only issue I have

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.150 
work just fine the only issue I have
with<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.840> audio<00:03:20.109> quality<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.680> audio<00:03:20.950> quality

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
with the audio quality the audio quality

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.030 
with the audio quality the audio quality
is<00:03:21.459> good<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.480> only<00:03:22.660> thing<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.989> only<00:03:23.560> problem<00:03:23.950> I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
is good the only thing I only problem I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.289 
is good the only thing I only problem I
ran<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.579> this<00:03:24.700> thing<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
ran into it this thing is that the

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.870 
ran into it this thing is that the
volume<00:03:25.829> actually<00:03:26.829> isn't<00:03:27.010> all<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.280> high<00:03:27.579> so

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
volume actually isn't all that high so

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.430 
volume actually isn't all that high so
you<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.239> actually<00:03:28.510> turn<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.840> volume<00:03:28.989> on

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you have to actually turn your volume on

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.170 
you have to actually turn your volume on
your<00:03:29.470> amplifier<00:03:30.280> up<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.579> little<00:03:30.730> higher<00:03:30.940> than

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
your amplifier up a little higher than

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.059 
your amplifier up a little higher than
you<00:03:31.269> normally<00:03:31.450> would<00:03:31.690> other<00:03:32.530> than<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:32.889> the

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
you normally would other than that the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.340 
you normally would other than that the
audio<00:03:33.310> quality<00:03:33.400> Holly<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.239> can't<00:03:34.870> talk<00:03:35.049> today

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
audio quality Holly I can't talk today

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.640 
audio quality Holly I can't talk today
the<00:03:35.680> audio<00:03:36.010> quality<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.519> great<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:38.230> thing<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the audio quality is great this thing is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.890 
the audio quality is great this thing is
amazing<00:03:38.950> quality<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.639> all<00:03:39.850> metal<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.660> feels

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
amazing quality it's all metal it feels

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.390 
amazing quality it's all metal it feels
nice<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.200> soft<00:03:41.620> feels<00:03:41.859> like<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.100> can<00:03:42.250> run

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
nice and soft feels like you can run

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.710 
nice and soft feels like you can run
over<00:03:42.579> with<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.760> car<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.239> would<00:03:43.329> still<00:03:43.569> work

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
over with a car and I would still work

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.050 
over with a car and I would still work
so<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.889> you're<00:03:45.040> having<00:03:45.250> trouble<00:03:45.400> hooking<00:03:45.760> up

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
so if you're having trouble hooking up
