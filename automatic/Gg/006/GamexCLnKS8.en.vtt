00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that bad process in order to actually

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.320 
that bad process in order to actually
you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.860> realize<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.549> much<00:01:20.790> better<00:01:21.180> if

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
know and it was always tough for me to
do<00:01:31.650> commentaries<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.759> being<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.659> little

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
do commentaries back then being a little

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
do commentaries back then being a little
mom<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> stuff<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.340> great

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
mom and all this stuff it's great

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
mom and all this stuff it's great
especially<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.049> trying<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
especially when you're trying to do

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.520 
especially when you're trying to do
commentaries<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.520> need<00:01:38.670> silence<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
commentaries you you need silence and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.569 
commentaries you you need silence and
usually<00:01:40.530> somebody<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> room<00:01:41.159> will<00:01:41.340> kind<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
usually somebody in a room will kind of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
usually somebody in a room will kind of
make<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> nervous<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.390> depends<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> type

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
make you nervous it depends on the type

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
make you nervous it depends on the type
of<00:01:43.110> person<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.159> confidence<00:01:45.030> plays<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of person you are but confidence plays a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
of person you are but confidence plays a
big<00:01:45.840> role<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.920> want<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> say

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
big role in that I think I want to say

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.710 
big role in that I think I want to say
confidence<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> probably<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> biggest

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
confidence is probably like the biggest

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
confidence is probably like the biggest
key<00:01:52.170> when<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.409> comes<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> commentaries

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
key when it comes to commentaries

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
key when it comes to commentaries
because<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.579> you're<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.729> confident<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
because if you're not confident you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.050 
because if you're not confident you
won't<00:01:54.780> sound<00:01:55.049> confident<00:01:55.590> there

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
won't sound confident there

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.600 
won't sound confident there
or<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.390> mean<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.229> won't<00:01:57.380> look<00:01:57.680> or<00:01:57.950> see<00:01:58.189> more

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
or you mean you won't look or see more

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.420 
or you mean you won't look or see more
it<00:01:59.090> won't<00:01:59.240> come<00:01:59.780> off<00:01:59.810> as<00:02:00.170> comfortable<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:01.399> a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
it won't come off as comfortable as a

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.399 
it won't come off as comfortable as a
regular<00:02:01.790> commentary<00:02:02.240> because<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:03.170> kind<00:02:03.350> of

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
regular commentary because you kind of

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.380 
regular commentary because you kind of
have<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.590> get<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> notion<00:02:04.159> out<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.299> don't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
have to get the notion out of you don't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.270 
have to get the notion out of you don't
really<00:02:05.659> care<00:02:05.840> what<00:02:05.960> people<00:02:06.110> think<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.770> just

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
getting a little bit better not much

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.370 
getting a little bit better not much
better<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.670> my<00:02:17.090> problem<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.900> used<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.200> say

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
um a lot and the thing is that if you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.839 
um a lot and the thing is that if you
start<00:02:21.920> off<00:02:21.980> commentaries<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:22.760> of

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
start off commentaries a lot of

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.850 
start off commentaries a lot of
commentaries<00:02:23.319> commentators<00:02:24.319> do<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.680> today

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
commentaries commentators do that today

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.580 
commentaries commentators do that today
say<00:02:25.700> um<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.450> basically<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.110> that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
say um it's just basically that that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.350 
say um it's just basically that that
little<00:02:27.890> pause<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.549> that<00:02:28.730> helps<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.299> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
someone is really really great at it but

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.240 
someone is really really great at it but
I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.049> once<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.410> get<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> point<00:03:04.100> where

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I think once you get to the point where

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.650 
I think once you get to the point where
you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.430> flow<00:03:04.640> off<00:03:04.730> your<00:03:04.850> tongue<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.359> really

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
you can flow off your tongue it's really

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.039 
you can flow off your tongue it's really
good

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
good

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.170 
good
and<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.380> most<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.709> how<00:03:06.799> much<00:03:06.950> whatever<00:03:07.180> but

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
and the most know how much whatever but

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.330 
and the most know how much whatever but
so<00:03:09.140> what<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.350> did<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.739> created<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:10.100> notepad

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so what I did was I created a notepad

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.420 
so what I did was I created a notepad
