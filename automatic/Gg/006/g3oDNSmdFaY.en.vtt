00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.520 

so<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> theme<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.739> week<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:54.260> ten<00:00:55.260> things

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so the theme this week is ten things

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
so the theme this week is ten things
we'd<00:00:55.739> save<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.760> house<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.960> house

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we'd save from our house if our house

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.220 
we'd save from our house if our house
were<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.440> fire<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.989> hard

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
were on fire I think and this is hard

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.250 
were on fire I think and this is hard
because<00:01:01.800> ten<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because ten things is like a lot of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
because ten things is like a lot of
things<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.920> can't<00:01:05.460> even<00:01:05.519> carry<00:01:05.790> ten<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
things I can't even carry ten think so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.670 
things I can't even carry ten think so
i'm<00:01:06.479> assuming<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.229> big<00:01:07.350> fire

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
i'm assuming it's not a very big fire

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
i'm assuming it's not a very big fire
yet<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> make<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.729> few<00:01:08.909> trips<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
yet so we can make a few trips in and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
yet so we can make a few trips in and
out<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> our<00:01:10.020> room<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.220> ten<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> these
