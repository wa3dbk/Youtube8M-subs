00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.809
 very good people good today I bring you a 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.700
 tutorial vale micra cube does the 

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.550
 installation of a mac the child b web 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.490
 for version 152 and well I'll teach 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.830
 a small review as improper installation 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.689
 we're worth what it's about is that when 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.869
 We were going to an enchantment table as is 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.480
 this one here because when we got here 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.300
 an object did not come three enchantments 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.749
 I did not even know what I was going to get 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.480
 the spell because it was a bit of a draw 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.340
 you can say good because of this 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.320
 bad so now we can know what 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.500
 Enchantment is going to get us into this 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.220
 sword that itching over ya 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.950
 we know that here they put booty 2 here 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.810
 acuity one and here push one and good 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.200
 depending on what we want 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.400
 we can in Qatar the sword is with 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.010
 what we want 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.270
 if you do not like to be in treatment 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.580
 they simply take out the sword , return it to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.430
 put in and you get new ones 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.040
 enchantments until he takes you out 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.350
 one that interests you and is already 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.930
 example you are interested in this abu 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.090
 disasters then we would give it and already 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.900
 we would have our sword of sharpness 3 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.880
 also happens with the armor that we 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.760
 we can put then in the treatment that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 we want and so not 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.310
 so we will lose enchantment levels 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.979
 with spells that are not very good and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.940
 it is simply because you love what 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.010
 you want in particular and it's good 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.229
 this is what makes this mod in particular 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 since it only shows you then the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.369
 description this but it's going very well 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.300
 really good now you're going to see the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.790
 installation 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.050
 good to install the instant view it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.880
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.410
 get off of these four files that you 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 I'll leave it in the video descriptions 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.040
 to download and well they would try 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.080
 view of bombay on foot in micro fons and the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 file pad leaf one of them 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 downloaded all these four files 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.050
 what you need to do is unzip it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 as I've done help here we have the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.160
 four files of the tablets are worth 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.780
 now what you have to assert is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000
 copy all the files in the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.690
 minecraft directory and good 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.590
 pressing the windows + ere key and we 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 come out this run here we will put 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.660
 percent percentage data percentage and you 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.060
 We would give here to accept worth once 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.840
 I made this we entered the folder 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 point minecraft and once here we have 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.860
 than creating a folder called live 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.250
 that would be lyb worth once created 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.330
 this we get and this pair of files 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 links that we have not downloaded then 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.300
 we copy the six files these there are 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.150
 here and we put it in the leaf folder that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.239
 we have not created right now it's worth it now 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.660
 we will back it as I have done and 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.030
 right now we enter the bin folder 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.880
 it's worth once we see the mini file 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.310
 kraft mini kraft point and depending on whether 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.110
 you have to activate the formats and we open it 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.870
 with a winrar that would be a secondary button 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.890
 open with we choose a program 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.130
 default and we use the winrar vale 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 once opened with the winrar or the 7 zip 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.910
 in which you want the first of 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.370
 everything is very important you have to erase 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.110
 this folder the meta ins and we do not erase 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.720
 we can be created in minecraft 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.770
 text thing black screen or good a 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.030
 secondary button we delete the folder 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.330
 and even a beautiful erase this folder what 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.210
 what you have to do is copy all these 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.870
 files of the other three here inside 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.310
 Slowly drop shipping for example 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.990
 we select all these files what 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.860
 copied inside mini kraft dot jar 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.470
 it is worth copying all and it is worth 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.340

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.470
 ok and now we take the mini craft force 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.440
 and we copy all these files there 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.280
 Who is worth we select everything 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.440

 ok, we'll have what it is 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.290
 installed then all the mod 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.240
 now we simply start the client 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:32.419

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.530
