starting price 250 by now and that means

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.819 
starting price 250 by now and that means
you're<00:01:37.570> going<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.750> make<00:01:37.840> 50<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.350> 100<00:01:38.680> coins

profit<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.369> know<00:01:39.430> there<00:01:39.759> is<00:01:39.939> some<00:01:40.270> sort<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.570> tax

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
profit I know there is some sort of tax

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.999 
profit I know there is some sort of tax
in<00:01:41.049> there<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.320> might<00:01:41.469> be<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> little<00:01:41.860> bit

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
in there so it might be a little bit

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.770 
in there so it might be a little bit
less<00:01:42.219> than<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.460> but<00:01:43.450> you're<00:01:43.570> still

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
less than that but you're still

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.719 
less than that but you're still
profiting<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.710> reason<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.430> works

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
profiting and the reason that this works

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.429 
profiting and the reason that this works
it<00:01:45.939> because<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.270> bought<00:01:46.479> so<00:01:46.869> many<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.350> they

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
it because you bought so many and they

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.940 
it because you bought so many and they
do<00:01:47.500> sell<00:01:47.890> very<00:01:48.640> quickly<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.810> turn<00:01:50.079> profit

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
do sell very quickly you can turn profit

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.590 
do sell very quickly you can turn profit
as<00:01:51.130> long<00:01:51.490> as<00:01:51.520> you're<00:01:51.700> selling<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.090> bunch<00:01:52.270> at

as long as you're selling a bunch at
once<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.320> still<00:01:53.469> makes<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.860> worth<00:01:54.130> your

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
once and it still makes it worth your

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.819 
once and it still makes it worth your
investment<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.930> terms<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.500> 14<00:01:56.799> a
