00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
thought

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.460 
thought
that<00:04:14.219> because<00:04:14.969> there's<00:04:15.239> salt<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.139> pepper<00:04:16.259> on

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
and I think that it should be good

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.029 
and I think that it should be good
without<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.269> there's<00:04:22.019> salt<00:04:22.380> on<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
