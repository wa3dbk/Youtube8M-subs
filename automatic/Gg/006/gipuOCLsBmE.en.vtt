00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the viola team with Aquila who 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.429
 still exchanges with L'Aquila service 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.960
 try to strike up an action with borja 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.929
 worth the start of the area 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 borja valero and then the ball jays is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 blatantly missing a goal a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 harder empty door to pull out 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 than inside 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.269
 successful operation in which it is not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.760
 been able to half a meter from 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.429
 door to door practically unguarded 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.890
 to put the ball on the net frankly 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.890
 it was harder to go wrong and that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.020
 center the square door succeeded 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 in the really titanic enterprise of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 kick to the side at no more than half a meter 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 from the door a series of rebounds still 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.140
 cuadrado and there is the possibility for the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 Florentine of the man with more 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.700
 I walk for L'Aquila 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.579
 the support for the Celts to the goal 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.440
 great goal on the counterattack of iai 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.140
 that is, that he leaned on the right plate 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.690
 behind curcios at the twenty-seventh 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 minute of the first Florentine time therefore 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 benefit 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.080
 merit of cuadrado who left on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.420
 right sector then the ball was 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 touched by borja valero 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.970
 the great conclusion of aquilani for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.909
 the precise support to the aic that has beaten 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 the goalkeeper with a right foot shot 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 shows off gabbiadini receives the side 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.490
 short of the left of the penalty area 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.860
 the support and then the gilardino is missing 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 close touch and miss the goal of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.110
 draw this is the truth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.119
 Gilardino did not arrive on time at 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 switch to the impact with the ball yes 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.810
 release penalty limit of the penalty area 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 cross deep but again 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 gilardino does not hook the ball 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 recovers from the opposite side morleo 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 controcross gilardino the central throw 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.780
 the ball parade escapes viviano e 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.900
 then savic and throws it 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.869
 corner kick still an uncertainty of 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.659
 and still live in Florentine Bologna a 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.560
 bologna we came to the searched you 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.560
 training balance 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 marco motta head one of the least 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.550
 brilliant of education and Bolognese 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.550
 but he got his hat off 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.080
 draw with a nice header on 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.580
 cross had been b 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.030
 on a free kick for a foul 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.090
 committed by cuadrado to the detriment of 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.190
 Morleo 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.800
 was also admonished and in practice the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.870
 fiorentina is reached by the goal of 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.150
 motta signed in the twelfth minute of the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.410
 second fraction is ready diamonds 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.260
 break down this new corner kick 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.970
 this time opt short garics in shooting and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.269
 words touches the pole giving the illusion 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.060
 network optics always 1 1 between bologna 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.200
 and Florentine bologna in great growth 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.930
 Florentine had a little difficulty 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 commanded the viola formation but a little 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.819
 of too little floristry and little leziosis 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 sword and therefore the bologna has returned 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.220
 strongly in the game 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.959
 now he is training the defense in defense 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.870
 by Stefano Pioli in possession of the ball 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.700
 with and garics the service for gilardino 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 forced to fall back but widens 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.079
 suddenly play on the sector of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.910
 left for diamonds while the ball a 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.250
 earth diamonds at the suggestion of morleo 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.790
 snap morleo goes to the morleo morleo bottom 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.540
 cross low gilardino confusion and of 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.000
 christ after the bone namely lazaros 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.400
 with high ball on the crossbar it was 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.750
 a nice action a congenital maneuver 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 while diamonds are free of three 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.670
 opponents support long for gilardino 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.090
 anticipated by rodriguez 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.109
 great shot of having rodriguez e 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.590
 el insertion and then the shot and goal 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.069
 initialed by 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.069
 protector 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.569
 Christ 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.700
 red took the lead 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.220
 blatantly the bologna when we are 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.129

 grazing shot a beautiful volley 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.700
 who has slipped to the right of the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.890
 viviano goalkeeper vainly leaning in 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.200
 plunge and blatantly the bologna e 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.180
 surpasses the Florentine Florentine that 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 had dominated clearly until 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.979
 twelfth minute of the second half 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.389
 when motta had accepted the draw 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.550
 on the development of a free kick 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.190
 beaten by the captain ahead now 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.750
 this pearl and lazaros 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.540
 to 1 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 this Greek player who comes from 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.300
 the Thessaloniki aris indeed author of a 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.300
 fine Florentine goal is forced to 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.960
 recover was in the lead for 1 to 0 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.590
 had in the ranking hooked the Milan 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.039
 quota 45 is now forced to look for the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.810
 draw 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.669
 attacks the Florentine in possession of 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.919
 ball with the hours 20 c shooting the parade 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.280
 amazing curci that plunges on 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.810
 his right advances the Florentine can 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.610
 be the last action of the match in 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.550
 possession of the ball with squared the 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.050
 percussion of the South American player 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.190
 support for borja valero tow la 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.229

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.860
 against crusts of canvases there is yes 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:18.340
 eat the ball of the sensational draw 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.590
 error at the small area of 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.300
 door has put the ball 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.599
 incredibly high from very favorable 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.699
 position and therefore when there are 20 left 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.400
 seconds at the end of the game the 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.009
 bologna can breathe the calcium of 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.620
 postponement of the formation goalkeeper 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.520

 rises to 29 in the ranking 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.020
 Florentine remains at 42 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.060
 I only remind you of the Bologna score 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.470
 2 Florentine 1 goals in the first half 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.479
