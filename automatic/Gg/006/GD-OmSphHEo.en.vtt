00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just like a s strip which I thought that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.420 
just like a s strip which I thought that
adidas<00:01:33.869> could<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> done<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.979> better<00:01:35.040> job<00:01:36.350> um

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
adidas could have done a better job um

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
adidas could have done a better job um
right<00:01:39.950> here<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:42.329> inside<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.979> you're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
right here on the inside so when you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
right here on the inside so when you're
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> pass<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:46.220> extremely<00:01:47.220> soft<00:01:47.960> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
going to pass it is extremely soft so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to pass it is extremely soft so
that<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.979> great<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> touch<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.829> passing

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that is great for a touch and passing
