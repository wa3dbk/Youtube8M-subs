I<00:01:19.910> was<00:01:20.030> experimenting<00:01:20.420> as<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.990> were<00:01:21.110> we've

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
I was experimenting as you were we've

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.700 
I was experimenting as you were we've
been<00:01:21.710> only<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.070> chore<00:01:22.370> which<00:01:23.230> just<00:01:24.230> left<00:01:24.440> him<00:01:24.590> of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
been only a chore which just left him of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.830 
been only a chore which just left him of
lost<00:01:25.040> position<00:01:25.460> actually<00:01:25.760> quite<00:01:26.150> quickly<00:01:26.450> I

don't<00:01:27.830> think<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.100> was<00:01:28.160> worth<00:01:28.310> uploading<00:01:28.880> but

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
don't think it was worth uploading but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.970 
don't think it was worth uploading but
um<00:01:30.760> if<00:01:31.760> i<00:01:31.940> can<00:01:32.060> get<00:01:32.180> revenge<00:01:32.480> on<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.840> sky<00:01:33.140> maybe
