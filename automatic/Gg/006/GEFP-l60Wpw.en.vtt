we've<00:00:08.769> had<00:00:08.950> a<00:00:08.980> couple<00:00:09.190> of<00:00:09.429> people<00:00:09.730> ask<00:00:09.910> us

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
we've had a couple of people ask us

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.240 
we've had a couple of people ask us
about<00:00:10.389> getting<00:00:11.019> another<00:00:11.290> inch<00:00:11.620> or<00:00:11.769> two<00:00:11.980> in

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
about getting another inch or two in

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.129 
about getting another inch or two in
depth<00:00:12.490> for<00:00:12.760> the<00:00:12.879> squat<00:00:13.240> but<00:00:13.750> they're<00:00:13.900> having

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
depth for the squat but they're having

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.150 
depth for the squat but they're having
troubles<00:00:14.500> and<00:00:14.650> they're<00:00:14.769> just<00:00:14.980> hitting

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
troubles and they're just hitting

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.040 
troubles and they're just hitting
parallel<00:00:15.760> are<00:00:15.939> there<00:00:16.090> any<00:00:16.240> little<00:00:16.689> tricks

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
parallel are there any little tricks

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.689 
parallel are there any little tricks
that<00:00:17.289> you<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.470> do<00:00:17.740> just<00:00:17.920> to<00:00:18.070> get<00:00:18.189> a<00:00:18.220> little<00:00:18.310> bit

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
that you can do just to get a little bit

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.450 
that you can do just to get a little bit
deeper<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.750> basic<00:00:20.260> simplest<00:00:20.890> thing<00:00:21.100> that<00:00:21.310> you

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
deeper the basic simplest thing that you

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.310 
deeper the basic simplest thing that you
can<00:00:21.580> do<00:00:21.789> is<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.240> open<00:00:22.390> up<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.810> groin<00:00:23.050> by

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
can do is to open up the groin by

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.140 
can do is to open up the groin by
opening<00:00:23.680> up<00:00:23.830> your<00:00:23.890> knees<00:00:24.280> on<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.640> way<00:00:24.940> down

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
opening up your knees on the way down

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.200 
opening up your knees on the way down
the<00:00:25.510> squat<00:00:25.810> for<00:00:26.740> example<00:00:27.280> if<00:00:27.520> I'm<00:00:27.760> squatting

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
the squat for example if I'm squatting

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.109 
the squat for example if I'm squatting
and<00:00:28.600> I<00:00:28.810> just<00:00:29.050> go<00:00:29.199> straight<00:00:29.619> down<00:00:29.940> this<00:00:30.940> is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
and I just go straight down this is

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.029 
and I just go straight down this is
about<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.539> depth<00:00:31.750> that<00:00:31.869> I'm<00:00:32.079> going<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.320> get<00:00:32.500> if

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
about the depth that I'm going to get if

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.430 
about the depth that I'm going to get if
I<00:00:33.129> open<00:00:33.430> up<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.579> knees<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:34.719> can<00:00:34.899> see<00:00:35.079> how<00:00:35.260> much

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
I open up the knees you can see how much

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.010 
I open up the knees you can see how much
deeper<00:00:35.859> I<00:00:35.890> actually<00:00:36.190> go<00:00:36.609> so<00:00:37.449> instead<00:00:37.719> of<00:00:37.780> just

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
deeper I actually go so instead of just

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.439 
deeper I actually go so instead of just
squatting<00:00:38.410> straight<00:00:38.829> down<00:00:39.129> what<00:00:39.999> you<00:00:40.179> want<00:00:40.359> to

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
squatting straight down what you want to

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.389 
squatting straight down what you want to
do<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.839> you<00:00:40.870> want<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.199> open<00:00:41.379> up<00:00:41.679> the<00:00:41.859> knees<00:00:42.069> on

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
do is you want to open up the knees on

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.479 
do is you want to open up the knees on
the<00:00:42.670> way<00:00:42.789> down<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:44.319> the<00:00:44.979> way<00:00:45.100> up<00:00:45.280> you

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
the way down and on the way up you

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.879 
the way down and on the way up you
actually<00:00:45.670> push<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.239> knees<00:00:46.449> out<00:00:46.659> to<00:00:46.719> so<00:00:47.409> open

these open the groin on the way down and
then<00:00:50.879> back<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.420> way<00:00:52.569> up<00:00:52.749> keep<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.350> knees

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
then back on the way up keep the knees

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.239 
then back on the way up keep the knees
out<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.719> can<00:00:55.870> practice<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:56.409> by<00:00:56.679> doing<00:00:56.739> boss

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
out you can practice this by doing boss

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.629 
out you can practice this by doing boss
wats<00:00:57.609> in<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:57.999> bottom<00:00:58.359> and<00:00:59.159> it's<00:01:00.159> always<00:01:00.339> great

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
wats in the bottom and it's always great

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
couple of different angles you can video

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.570 
couple of different angles you can video
from<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.659> front<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.170> see<00:01:05.860> if<00:01:06.010> you're<00:01:06.190> opening

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
from the front to see if you're opening

step

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.050 

our<00:01:16.500> latest<00:01:16.859> question<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.579> should<00:01:17.820> women

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
our latest question is should women

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300 
our latest question is should women
trained<00:01:18.450> differently<00:01:18.869> than<00:01:19.079> men<00:01:19.310> simple

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
trained differently than men simple

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
trained differently than men simple
answer<00:01:20.700> no<00:01:21.119> men<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> women<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> same

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
answer no men and women have the same

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.639 
answer no men and women have the same
muscles<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> their<00:01:23.520> body<00:01:23.789> same<00:01:24.750> moving<00:01:25.200> parts

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
muscles in their body same moving parts

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.190 
muscles in their body same moving parts
so<00:01:26.130> no<00:01:26.759> men<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> women<00:01:27.719> should<00:01:27.869> train<00:01:28.079> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so no men and women should train the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
so no men and women should train the
same<00:01:28.439> however<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.340> being<00:01:29.369> said<00:01:29.990> women<00:01:30.990> often

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
same however that being said women often

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
same however that being said women often
have<00:01:31.649> more<00:01:31.950> muscular<00:01:32.310> endurance<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.869> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
have more muscular endurance so they can

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
have more muscular endurance so they can
often<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.590> more<00:01:35.009> repetitions<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.179> same

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
often do more repetitions at the same

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.740 
often do more repetitions at the same
percentage<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:37.079> weight<00:01:37.289> we<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.520> may<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
percentage of weight we also may have a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
percentage of weight we also may have a
lower<00:01:40.020> center<00:01:40.469> of<00:01:40.500> gravity<00:01:41.000> compared<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.179> men

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
lower center of gravity compared to men

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.949 
lower center of gravity compared to men
we<00:01:42.959> have<00:01:43.170> often<00:01:44.030> heavier<00:01:45.030> lower<00:01:45.270> bodies<00:01:45.719> and

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
we have often heavier lower bodies and

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.929 
we have often heavier lower bodies and
we<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.140> upper<00:01:46.439> body<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.009> far<00:01:47.310> place<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
we do upper body so far place that it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.699 
we do upper body so far place that it
might<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.569> different<00:01:48.840> technique

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
might be a little different technique

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.499 
might be a little different technique
might<00:01:50.039> be<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.429> different<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
might be a little different but that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.449 
might be a little different but that
also<00:01:51.720> varies<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.409> different<00:01:52.470> body<00:01:52.920> types<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
also varies for different body types of

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.690 
also varies for different body types of
men<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.329> short<00:01:54.750> no<00:01:55.319> men<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.220> women<00:01:56.489> should

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
men so in short no men and women should

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.049 
men so in short no men and women should
train<00:01:56.970> exactly<00:01:57.599> the<00:01:57.840> same
