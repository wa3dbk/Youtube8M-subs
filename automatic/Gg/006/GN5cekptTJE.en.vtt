00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.700
 greetings and hammering for everyone here 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.800
 so hammer back in the world of 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.170
 minecraft to bring you other very modes 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.810
 useful and very simple like the last 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.270
 I brought you inventor and in fact 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.600
 you'll see it right away it's called wild 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.420
 love whose initials mean exactly 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.460
 what i'm looking at or i'm 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.789
 looking and how are you going to see is very 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.890
 simple very easy to use but to the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.419
 it will turn out to be quite time 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.989
 utility if you are using 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.899
 many mods good because as you know 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.149
 the last thing that I taught you about the solo 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.140
 inventor and when he put the mouse over 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.180
 it showed me the content of the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.210
 storage without having to open them and 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 you are looking here on the top 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.070
 you see the name and the object 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 mode to which it belongs in this case 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 belongs to minecraft aguilar for that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 they put minecraft here for example the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.759
 refrigerator to me the mode was disqualified 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 and as you can see, we simply 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.590
 shows the name of the object and the mod to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.770
 which belongs as I say if you have 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 example the pack of 50 show generates 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 adventures as they are many objects 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.720
 new with this you can know to what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.470
 every thing that belongs belongs 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.840
 object such as kraft e arlo and others was created 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 initially as an extension of the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.390
 note no hitter you see that here works 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 also here in the inventory equal if 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 we have any object we put the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.550
 mouse over and we also see current mode 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.340
 is part for example here this one has 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.640
 my time in good and in the fish statue 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 wood and here we have also the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.450
 the altar here we have the master craft 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.430
 unisur a mode a warehouse this from the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 night will turn on if we go by 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.610
 example to the recipes because the same 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.380
 it also shows us the name and the mode 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.619
 which belongs whenever they put 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.330
 minecraft while vanilla obviously and 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.330
 if for example we put here also 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.310
 the altar as you see news also my 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.790
 time and you see that any way that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.189
 you have or to say the objects and the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 blocks absolutely everything to which 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.709
 belongs each so that you do not have 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 so much trouble when it comes to tinkering or 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.360
 get or get what you need 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 then for example also in the case of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.659
 the villagers 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.150
 let's see it a second in the villagers 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.659
 the animal modules the creatures 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.010
 etc. has been running shows 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.010
 also here on the top 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.950
 similar to the dahmash indicators the name 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.709
 shows us the hearts instead of the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.930
 life in points and then it shows us 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.239
 also that we have belongs to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.329
 minecraft vanilla obviously but if 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.250
 we had some way that we added 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.049
 creatures or extra animals as well 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.780
 would tell us with the belongs so that what 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.180
 I knew everything and you see that it is simply 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.650
 an informative mod but that is done 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.240
 simply informative like the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.770
 inventor hall and it is very useful 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.260
 and the truth is that it will provide us 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.010
 a lot of things especially if we use 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.300
 very much we leave with the installation 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.880
 As always, I recommend you make a 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.730
 clean installation 10 out of 0 so we 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.940
 let's go first here to percentage app 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.470
 percentage data and we changed the name 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 to the minecraft folder well the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.210
 we copy to another site to make a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.940
 clean installation as I said 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.520
 now we will run the launcher 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.040
 we have to select the version here 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.500
 that we are going to install I was in the 164 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.690
 so now I'm going to select the 172 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.870
 so you can see that it's exactly the same 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.640
 we give 6 profile we give the button 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.220
 play and we install all the files 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.130
 necessary once the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.260
 installation opens the game 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.840
 and then we close it 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.640
 now let's install force I'm going to 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.670
 install the 1024 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.090
 for 172 if you were to use 164 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.090
 it would be 96 5 we will be here 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.419
 we give you right click to open with java 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:26.789
 platform the installation path is this 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.000
 either with the customer prize with the give 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.340
 that the pp so we give it to accept 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.349
 install the necessary files you 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.819
 we accept again and now 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.159
 We run again launcher 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.280
 minecraft we have to select the 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.180
 profile de force that was created 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.530
 check here that is the version 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.970
 1024 for 172 and we give the play 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.590
 we close again now of the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.080
 game 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.060
 and now let's install how 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.450
 you see I have here for about 64 and for 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.030
 about 72 in the case of 164 is the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.580
 file points while in the case 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.470
 of the 172 is a hard point of all 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.060
 ways and the links go to the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.490
 I will compress them 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.910
 when you upload it and if you are going to use 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.910
 172 the 'tsar unzip and take the 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.960
 hard that there would be inside no not here another 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.750
 time to percentage app data percentage 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.810
 we entered points minecraft mods what 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.360
 we paste after having put the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.190
 file of huaylas in the folder of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.680
 minecraft mods we have to catch the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.960
 codec chicken core and do not take it off 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.530
 because as I said, it's an extension 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.210
 from him I'm going to take those from the 17 2 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.360
 we would also take here percentage that 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.580
 data percentage and here in minecraft mods 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.750
 because we have to stick them to 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.750
 were together with this one 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.420
 now we run the launcher 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.670
 we give the play and here is in mode 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.120
 is the force tight of chicken core no 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:05.040
 I have systems and here we have huaylas from 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.040
 done if we enter here in multiplayer 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.780
 I did not mention it, you are going to see 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.780
 right away 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.650
 how it works also in multiplayer 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.410
 we will design what we also point out 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.540
 will teach us which object it is since 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.810
 obviously belongs to us if you enter a 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.580
 server without mods will serve us but a 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.100
 server of musicians would be quite 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.230
 useful and nothing more if you liked to give 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.760
 lake subscribe and do not forget to share 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.760
 the videos see you
