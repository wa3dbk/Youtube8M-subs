 hello to you all glorious friends again 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.080
 bummer and bone and today we will prepare 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880
 such an unusual breakfast like eggs 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.250
 Benedict and in this issue we steer 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 there will be a bone but because this is his recipe 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.670
 which well it turns out that we will 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 do what are eggs benedict eggs 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 Benedict is a breakfast dish. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.279
 actually it is as easy 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 guess seized from the eggs but 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
 cooked in an unusual way this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.920
 there will be poached eggs 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 actually like a sandwich where we are 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 put first barrel fry either 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.020
 toast to such a plan something then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 some gasket we give half 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 English breakfast therefore we 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.270
 put in bekonchikom fried egg on top 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 and prepare for this beautiful 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 hollandaise sauce 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 ok we drove the main thing and rented 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 let's look at the table. what to us 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.039
 need for this recipe 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.489
 actually first of all we need 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.190
 eggs for us to be laying our 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.980
 ready burned it bread for sauce 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 we will need butter or 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 the boy also has eggs in the sauce too 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 go and bacon is already 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 addition so that not pure tones of bread 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.140
 it was first thing to disconnect the yolks from 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.299
 proteins 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 how many eggs does it depend on 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.240
 how much to go out on the actual 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 deed 2 3 is enough 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.360
 pour yolks and a convenient bowl 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.689
 then salt a lot of salt 2 decent 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.150
 add so on 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.820
 a little bit of water literally with one 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.229
 tablespoon and stir critics 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.700
 after so how did it acquired 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.610
 homogeneous consistency set on 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.060
 water bath when we have this whole thing 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 starts warming stir and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 start adding butter so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.680
 but you have 3 yolks how much cream 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 oils need 3 yolks 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 well about 100 grams shorter than half a pack 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.750
 plus or minus 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.360
 shuffle and add 3 cubes 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.610
 how are they going to add more 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.620
 it is very important to ensure that squirrels 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.360
 not so cooked so terribly high 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.170
 temperature and cook on weak 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.060
 water bath melts everything when 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.670
 all your butter is melted we start 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.180
 actively churn it a clog 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 density decent keeper I should say 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.810
 was very liquid sour cream for fast you 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.800
 we decided to use this action 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:24.980
 blender when the sauce is thickened add 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.050
 about 3 lemon juice naturally 3 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.390
 lemon start cooking and saved here 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.590
 actually for this we put water and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.050
 bring to a boil 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.480
 boil we need such that small 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.030
 small bubbles rising from the bottom 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.790
 up it is not necessary that water boils when 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.570
 our troops are almost boiling 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 add a little bit of it 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.910
 acidify add apple to it 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.310
 vinegar somewhere and a half tablespoons of tea 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.690
 you tea and a half tablespoon on 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.700
 liter it will allow us to make poached eggs 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.440
 such that they do not dissolve protein by 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.019
 the whole pot was neat 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.200
 such still under the guidance of the bones i 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.160
 I will try to do it like this 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.260
 is but a knife you will not need no 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.900
 knife don't need to break egg wow 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.320
 edge of the saucepan and open in the very 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 at the bottom so that the face does not flop in 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.459
 very low before the water one sharp 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.459
 confident lip movement find fails 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 perfectly 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.770
 her soup is very easy to make 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.930
 just wait four minutes 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.140
 In this case, the fact that we have dissolved 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.060
 it is a lack of eggs the fact is that if u 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.860
 you have absolutely fresh only with 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.260
 poultry it will be beautiful 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.390
 Well, if it spreads like this 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.310
 it spreads further this but already 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.110
 lay this this you can try 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.730
 avoid if you put eggs in 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.830
 fridge well we set well how 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.500
 you see the effects are not very much because 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.480
 we still sell eggs such are not 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.110
 the very first freshness is called words 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.180
 elbow no corners after exactly 4 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.500
 minutes we take out the egg on skimmers to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.060
 unfortunately so it is necessary 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.880
 to pervert with a ladle 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.430
 and then we shift it to the cold 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.280
 water so she stopped preparing 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.000
 the first egg we cool is training 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.000
 do the second 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.860
 Toast our bread 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.260
 dry griddle no oil 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.450
 nothing is required exactly so he 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.460
 turned into a toast estesno can be made 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.620
 toast and yes if you have a post we have it 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:50.630
 no so we do as hard as 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.020
 roasted proceed or order 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.760
 like a wall or a half but it is to your taste 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.450
 for example the english people are crispy bacon 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.450
 chick such 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.310
 simply 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.310
 knot . 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.720
 In general, if you have on eggs 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.830
 some ugly still his fig wreaths 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.040
 some kind of fringe 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.380
 you can get rid of them 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.780
 this is done solely for beauty 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.380
 that the stove you had a holistic such here 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.910
 neat points egg and this 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.910

 dishes you can replace it just 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.300
