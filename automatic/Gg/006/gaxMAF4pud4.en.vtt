00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380
 one of our subscribers asked us 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.690
 question how much are dug on what 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 depth of dug posts here these 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 perennial garters for tomatoes or 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 let's say a trellis hang for cucumbers 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.160
 net so I just say that I do not FFPs 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.590
 I drove them down 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.359
 scored in the ground well, somewhere to a depth of 30 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 centimeters 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:38.910
 scored my first tests were scored 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 somewhere deeper by 70 centimeters 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 after i made the stretchs here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.230
 here tension I did I was already with acacia 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 there inside 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.370
 underground this column stands acacia 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.260
 how he does do it scored 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 somewhere on 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.480
 us to a height of 30 centimeters from the ground 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.409
 tied the wire well stretched and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.799
 then scored on here and she sank 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.119
 and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.119
 I pulled out what I pulled out 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 made them and then come here on 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 midst 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.590
 for the wire only once took down only 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.080
 and went and I did not understand at first that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 happened why she sagged and then 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 I just realized that here is a column 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.329
 just sank into the ground he went under 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.689
 here's the pressure on the pock 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.520
 tried and asked there and here I thought 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.450
 how could I do it best 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.479
 bollards from acacia thickness 5 by 5 a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.900
 whole columns so I did 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.390
 way 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.680
 here look here cucumber posts 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.060
 need a cucumber here is a brick 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 the usual one on this side likewise lies 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.560
 part of another 9 and now you see yes here you can see 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.460
 brick lies 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.460
 and on it 200 as a guest 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.690
 200k two from this side and from this 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.459
 sides I just drilled a hole 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:25.990
 here and there pasted guest2 weave sadil 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.130
 a column before him here is a brick that lies in 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.640
 Earth's Sadilov column to him to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.050
 nail 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.600
 rested on the bricks and only then here 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.990
 there was already one stand on the side of the other 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.570
 the bar on which the stretch was here 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.310
 here spun well started then 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.970
 scored then the posts do not squander 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.760
 But for support 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.780
 I easily the entire structure of the middle, 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.220
 did this oak 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.930
 support here she is just worth the ground 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:11.890
 she is here and here is the most here 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.360
 the plate is stuffed on the ground just this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.540
 on on on the nails spinning here 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.880
 to make it easier because here like on 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.420
 hangs let's say tomatoes with this 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.590
 parties 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.410
 bushes 10 on this side of 10 since on 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.150
 hangs tomatoes here is a good weight then 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.190
 to make it easier all over in 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.160
 constructions still set the middle 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.660
 plank 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.640
 here I can show it to me 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.239
 move there can be removed here 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.350
 but the essence remains the fact that it 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.350
 just stands as support 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.350
 Well, that's basically the principle of such 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.820
 here is the moment such are the tricks 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.820
 good luck to you in your organic land
