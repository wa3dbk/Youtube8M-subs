00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.110
 except we work 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.620

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.150
 they how it all happened that you 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.950

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.410
 that is a lot of Polishchuk 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.420
 kimi dead end 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 too but good with nike 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 previous that although that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.359
 work from the field 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.549
 photo wave of this work along with 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.709
 tributary 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.809
 Considering 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.409
 ales that he is very 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.719
 on persuasion they are engaged as to 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.799
 For example, a good example of Libya 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.869
 good role pucci has the same 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.589
 and I am very glad that 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.209
 work with him 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.949
 but will 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.979
 a lot of time 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 now destroyed 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.189
 pacak means 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.559
 I think that 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.659
 I am sure that there will be success 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.699
 and will be 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.279
 And how do you evaluate the axial axis more often 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.689
 duel against washing searches from anyone 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.150
 he was not very difficult despite 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.909
 this 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.349
 he but 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.349
 he's a little bit all stayed there now 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.289
 good boxer 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.339
 normal match 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.079
 but this term on the boat accounts one 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.479
 problem 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.879
 but this is the past I do not have so 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.469
 sparring partner that we train 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.019
 ok there 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.019
 couldn't good 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.639
 before the first as and generally difficult for 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.509
 descendants rat staff price cheat 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.449
 at all 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.019
 practice we will have the opportunity to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.129
 by the sum of 10 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.209
 Ideally 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.259
 when you are on your way 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:36.789
 next fight 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.499
 placed 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.489
 planning 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.049

 shouts of mityukov 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.509
 i think my years 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.729
 eat the following 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.689
 i count so 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.819
 there will recoup 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.159
 but here too 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 because that is sport 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.809
 solemnity there are many export 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.989
 partners 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
 and the machine is now training points 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.529
 one night party meager speed back 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.739

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.339
