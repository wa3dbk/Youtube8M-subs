00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I figured you know what fuck it and I'll

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
I figured you know what fuck it and I'll
give<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> shot<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.939> was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
give it a shot and what I would do was

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
give it a shot and what I would do was
it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.170> during<00:01:10.320> school<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.950> school<00:01:11.010> year<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it was during school the school year so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.600 
it was during school the school year so
I<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:11.729> basically<00:01:11.909> wake<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.869> every<00:01:13.080> morning

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
I would basically wake up every morning

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
I would basically wake up every morning
after<00:01:14.610> being<00:01:14.760> fasted<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.450> sixty<00:01:15.900> six

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
after being fasted for about sixty six

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
after being fasted for about sixty six
let's<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.380> say<00:01:16.500> seven<00:01:16.860> hours<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.790> um<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
let's just say seven hours so um and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.640 
let's just say seven hours so um and
then<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> wouldn't<00:01:18.750> eat<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> whole<00:01:19.170> school<00:01:19.470> day

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
then I wouldn't eat the whole school day

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
then I wouldn't eat the whole school day
I<00:01:19.860> wouldn't<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.400> eaten<00:01:20.520> breakfast<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I wouldn't have eaten breakfast that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.370 
I wouldn't have eaten breakfast that
when<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.299> launched<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.780> school<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> wooden

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
when he launched in school and a wooden

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
when he launched in school and a wooden
eat<00:01:22.530> dinner<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> will<00:01:24.210> come<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.540> 2<00:01:24.659> 30ish

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
eat dinner and I will come with 2 30ish

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.800 
eat dinner and I will come with 2 30ish
so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.189> from<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.060> seven<00:01:27.509> hours

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so I would go from you know seven hours

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
so I would go from you know seven hours
fasting<00:01:28.799> wake<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.210> go

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fasting wake up and then I would go

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
fasting wake up and then I would go
about<00:01:30.420> another<00:01:30.720> six<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> half<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.560> seven

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
about another six and a half to seven

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.420 
about another six and a half to seven
hours<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.220> about<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.790> 14<00:01:33.270> hour<00:01:33.360> fast

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
hours so that's about a 14 hour fast

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.980 
hours so that's about a 14 hour fast
excuse<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.570> bed<00:01:36.780> at

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
excuse me and then I would go to bed at

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
excuse me and then I would go to bed at
like<00:01:37.020> ten<00:01:37.320> o'clock<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> night<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.460> that's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
like ten o'clock that night so that's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.520 
like ten o'clock that night so that's
probably<00:01:38.909> about<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.390> seven-hour<00:01:39.990> eating

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
probably about a seven-hour eating

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
probably about a seven-hour eating
window<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.850> therefore<00:01:42.290> gave<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.470> another

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
window which therefore gave me another

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
window which therefore gave me another
you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.549> repeat<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> step<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you know and then repeat the step so I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.550 
you know and then repeat the step so I

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.380 
that's what eight hours I think 10 it's
eight<00:03:49.090> hours<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.390> fasting<00:03:49.629> right<00:03:49.989> there<00:03:51.390> you

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.750 

I<00:03:57.060> guess<00:03:57.690> wait<00:03:58.050> until<00:03:58.320> like<00:03:58.440> 12<00:03:58.620> o'clock<00:03:58.980> so

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
I guess wait until like 12 o'clock so

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.150 
I guess wait until like 12 o'clock so
I'll<00:03:59.850> be<00:03:59.970> another<00:04:00.180> six<00:04:00.540> hours<00:04:00.690> before<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.980> eat

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
I'll be another six hours before you eat

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.300

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
just so this is a starting app thing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.220 
just so this is a starting app thing
that<00:04:07.770> will<00:04:07.860> make<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.160> at<00:04:08.340> 14<00:04:08.790> hours<00:04:09.020> 14<00:04:10.020> hour

fast and then go ahead and eat in a 10
hour<00:04:13.080> window<00:04:13.470> maybe<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> way<00:04:14.370> up<00:04:14.460> until

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
hour window maybe all the way up until

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.819 
hour window maybe all the way up until
ten<00:04:14.850> o'clock<00:04:14.900> unless<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.049> want<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.320> shorten

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
ten o'clock unless you want to shorten

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.590 
ten o'clock unless you want to shorten
your<00:04:16.950> window<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.280> maybe<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.760> six<00:04:18.150> o'clock

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600

and it'll get even a longer fast for the
next<00:04:20.910> day<00:04:21.710> therefore<00:04:22.710> burning<00:04:23.100> more<00:04:23.220> fat<00:04:23.400> so

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730
