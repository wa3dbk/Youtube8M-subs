let's get into this it's like a drawing
painting<00:00:41.100> combination<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> different

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
painting combination of different

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
painting combination of different
materials<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.200> used<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> whole<00:00:43.739> bunch<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
materials I just used a whole bunch of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.959 
materials I just used a whole bunch of
things<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.550> picture<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.870> did<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> my

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
things on this picture and I did it my

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.950 
things on this picture and I did it my
senior<00:00:47.969> year<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.210> high<00:00:48.420> school<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
senior year in high school I think I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.959 
senior year in high school I think I
started<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.530> junior<00:00:49.829> year<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.760> my

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
started at junior year I don't think my

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
started at junior year I don't think my
skill<00:00:51.420> level<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> bestest<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> think

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
skill level is the bestest but I think

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
skill level is the bestest but I think
the<00:00:53.219> meaning<00:00:53.640> behind<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> means

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the meaning behind it and what it means

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
the meaning behind it and what it means
to<00:00:54.930> me<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> why<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.420> my

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to me is this is why I think it's my

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
to me is this is why I think it's my
favorite<00:00:58.020> piece<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> I've<00:00:58.620> ever<00:00:58.739> done<00:00:58.949> so

but I didn't end up finishing the angel
part<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.850> interesting

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
part which i think is really interesting

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.679 
part which i think is really interesting
with<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.170> almost<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
with my back it was almost just

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
reflecting the way I felt at the time

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
reflecting the way I felt at the time
but<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.270> did<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.020> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> work<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

it<00:01:55.950> means<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.479> reflects<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it means a lot is because it reflects a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
it means a lot is because it reflects a
mood<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> feeling<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> felt<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.969> I
