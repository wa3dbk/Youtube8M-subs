because there's some of these fountains

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.670 
because there's some of these fountains
that<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.540> are<00:03:01.660> more<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.110> there's<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.620> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
that that are more of there's like a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.910 
that that are more of there's like a
couple<00:03:03.360> billion<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.690> there<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.650> know<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
couple billion in there I don't know the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.110 
couple billion in there I don't know the
price<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.340> those<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.860> don't<00:03:08.860> know<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.670> exact

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
price of those so I don't know the exact

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.900 
price of those so I don't know the exact
price<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:10.930> I'm<00:03:11.200> assuming<00:03:11.710> it's<00:03:12.130> from<00:03:12.460> about

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
price but I'm assuming it's from about

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.000 
price but I'm assuming it's from about
four<00:03:13.360> hundred<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.900> twenty<00:03:14.230> dollars<00:03:14.320> down<00:03:14.770> if

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
four hundred and twenty dollars down if

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.920 
four hundred and twenty dollars down if
you<00:03:15.100> were<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.450> stand<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
you were to go to the stand and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.660 
you were to go to the stand and
cherry-pick<00:03:17.380> these<00:03:17.680> items<00:03:18.250> some<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.580> these

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
cherry-pick these items some of these

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.750 
cherry-pick these items some of these
things<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.090> can't<00:03:19.330> get<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.739> stand<00:03:21.010> so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
things you can't get in the stand so

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.479 
things you can't get in the stand so
it's<00:03:22.209> kind<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.630> an<00:03:22.780> exclusive<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.410> box<00:03:23.650> so

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
it's kind of an exclusive to the box so

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.130 
it's kind of an exclusive to the box so
there's<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.600> most<00:03:25.750> part<00:03:25.840> most

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
there's that but for the most part most

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.380 
there's that but for the most part most
big<00:03:26.470> items<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.920> can<00:03:27.100> cherry<00:03:27.400> pick<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.670> find
