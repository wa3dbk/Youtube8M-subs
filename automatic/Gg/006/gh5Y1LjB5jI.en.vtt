 on this shelf he was here every time 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.850

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.850
 now I'll show you well 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.290
 steel made this we have found 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 all three pieces and we can 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 go back now here stupidly 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 I'm dead but luckily I can go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.790
 in purgatory mode and nothing 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.380
 back we were always in the area 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.480
 port where there will be a table from 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.480
 work and you can build yours 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.289
 your shield here is a shield 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.690
 important to me because so at least 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.819
 whenever you have your back maybe 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 you know zombies that attack you behind 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.930
 you will have no problems 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.670
 nothing after that we'll go looking 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.000
 still 73 pieces that to build the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.220
 our acid kit will soon see 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.799
 the first piece where to find it I tell you 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.330
 immediately that is always starting from 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.970
 map start the new central map 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.120
 this is where you will start the game 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.769
 you will go there will be two doors to open e 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.500
 open one and be approved practically 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.769
 both are not that you have to spend 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.480
 other money at least mode just because 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.819
 I fourth playing single no to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.239
 genocide to play on swatch anyway 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.730
 we will always see here in the Michigan area 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.780
 of this long corridor where you will find 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.460
 this brings you here from the custodian what is not 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.820
 I remember you go to mode 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.040
 purgatory you will find you see right in 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.430
 this door 4 you see this hole here 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.780
 entratel and trolley and operated later 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.160
 with your rationed electricity and the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.170
 door to open the door of the area 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.750
 of the caretaker or something 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.110
 the game is English so it is not me 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.830
 very easy since I don't understand it 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.540
 anyway since you're always in 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.300
 You will use a variety of purgatory methods 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.830
 times several times 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.960
 take advantage of the operation every time 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.770
 as much as possible of the things you will find 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.910
 around 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.310
 let's go ahead in this room e 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.600
 we will find the next piece where it is 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.710
 also the cash and many and much more 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.620
 you will find the first the first piece for 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.450
 the acid kit that will allow us then 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.410
 you will see what the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.690
 acid kit found the first piece 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.690
 we always go back in the corridor 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.000
 where it usually should be ie 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.740
 should usually have it once 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 found then found more they had to 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.670
 look for another room so much that you don't 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.970
 you will find here maybe come back again 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.730
 back and go see these lazzano 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.070
 central to main area where you are 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.980
 born gone to another door e 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.300
 you will find this room here you go 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.100
 on the corner usually should 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.700
 being here is this kind of 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.310
 take it for the acidy chianti you take it 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.810
 we always go forward the same room 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.780
 this big door operated entrances 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.670
 go to the infirmary immediately to the left is 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.670
 up the stairs we will find this room 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.040
 Infirmary 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.170
 look around and we will find 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.980
 the last very important piece for 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.070
 finish in our kit we found 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.370
 acid at this time 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:07.260
 we will always go back again where 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:10.200
 we entered this room you see here 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.880
 on the left we find a table with work 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.640
 where we can build our who is 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.370
 silent once built the kit acid 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.720
 we will go where the pay attention was 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.240
 because if there is there is around 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.040
 here you see this is the case 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.220
 we look for our new weapon of name 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.460
 plan der garde a power now so 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.969
 like when the candles are blows 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.659
 normal are bursts from 3 mar 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.099
 it doesn't really have the power anyway 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.919
 we will modify it immediately 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.559
 immediately if you have the acid kit 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.469
 we support it is our kit from the aci 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:53.379
 sweets will change the weapon by changing i 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:56.110
 shots and once they disappear from 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.269
 zombies these will explode attention 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.729
 it was not closer and jumped into 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:02.649
