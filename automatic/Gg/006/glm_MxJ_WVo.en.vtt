00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:48.290 
wipe this off see what kind of results
we<00:04:37.440> got<00:04:45.890> not<00:04:46.890> too<00:04:47.100> bad<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.580> mean<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.120> looks

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
we got not too bad I mean it looks

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.350 
we got not too bad I mean it looks
better<00:04:48.510> than<00:04:48.660> before<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.110> bit<00:04:49.730> and<00:04:50.730> there's<00:04:51.180> the

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
better than before a bit and there's the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.820 
better than before a bit and there's the
rest<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.840> trim<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:54.470> I'm<00:04:55.470> going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.650> clean

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
rest of the trim so I'm going to clean

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.230 
rest of the trim so I'm going to clean
the<00:04:55.890> rest<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.190> trim<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.550> then<00:04:57.000> I'll<00:04:57.090> apply

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the rest of the trim and then I'll apply

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.330 
the rest of the trim and then I'll apply
the<00:04:57.330> VRT<00:04:58.050> on<00:04:58.200> this<00:04:58.350> section

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.770 

plying<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.210> VRT<00:05:06.940> see<00:05:07.940> what<00:05:08.060> kind<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.330> results

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
plying the VRT see what kind of results

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:27.190 
plying the VRT see what kind of results
we<00:05:08.900> get<00:05:09.080> if<00:05:09.650> any

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800 

so<00:05:28.200> there<00:05:28.380> we<00:05:28.500> have<00:05:28.680> it<00:05:29.420> I'll<00:05:30.420> take<00:05:30.630> some

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
so there we have it I'll take some

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.800 
so there we have it I'll take some
pictures<00:05:30.960> as<00:05:31.320> well<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.800> post<00:05:31.980> them<00:05:32.250> up<00:05:32.810> after

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
pictures as well and post them up after

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.030 
pictures as well and post them up after
this

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.250 

but<00:05:42.040> these<00:05:42.250> are<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.550> results<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:43.060> got<00:05:43.330> my

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
but these are the results I got my

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.530 
but these are the results I got my
opinion<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.800> looks<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:45.040> bit<00:05:45.160> better<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.880> mean

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
opinion it looks a bit better I mean

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.690 
opinion it looks a bit better I mean
it's<00:05:46.690> not<00:05:46.810> gonna<00:05:47.020> it's<00:05:47.560> not<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.770> magic<00:05:48.460> marker

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
it's not gonna it's not a magic marker

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.820 
it's not gonna it's not a magic marker
or<00:05:48.940> anything<00:05:49.090> like<00:05:49.330> we<00:05:49.540> can<00:05:49.660> color<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.080> which

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
or anything like we can color it which

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.670 
or anything like we can color it which
maybe<00:05:51.130> that<00:05:51.430> might<00:05:51.640> be<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:52.110> good<00:05:53.110> step<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.530> do

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
maybe that might be a good step to do

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.910 
maybe that might be a good step to do
for<00:05:53.980> this<00:05:54.160> car<00:05:54.400> but<00:05:55.230> it<00:05:56.230> does<00:05:56.470> look<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.740> bit

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
for this car but it does look a bit

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.980 
for this car but it does look a bit
better<00:05:56.950> in<00:05:57.250> my<00:05:57.370> opinion<00:05:57.490> on<00:05:58.480> what<00:05:58.720> you<00:05:58.840> guys

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
better in my opinion on what you guys

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.550 
better in my opinion on what you guys
think<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:01.270> again<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.720> steps<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.200> took<00:06:04.560> get

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
think so again the steps that I took get

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.140 
think so again the steps that I took get
some<00:06:05.830> all-purpose<00:06:06.730> cleaner

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
some all-purpose cleaner

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.470 
some all-purpose cleaner
I<00:06:07.180> recommend<00:06:08.140> Adams<00:06:08.440> all-purpose<00:06:08.860> cleaner

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
I recommend Adams all-purpose cleaner

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.700 
I recommend Adams all-purpose cleaner
dig<00:06:10.480> for<00:06:10.690> a<00:06:10.720> toothbrush<00:06:11.140> in<00:06:11.320> your<00:06:11.440> neighbor's

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
dig for a toothbrush in your neighbor's

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.890 
dig for a toothbrush in your neighbor's
trash<00:06:11.920> can

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
trash can

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.620 
trash can
I<00:06:14.130> guess<00:06:15.130> brush<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.550> off<00:06:15.700> with<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.270> toothbrush

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
I guess brush it off with the toothbrush

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.150 
I guess brush it off with the toothbrush
and<00:06:17.730> follow<00:06:18.730> up<00:06:18.940> with<00:06:19.000> some<00:06:19.150> VRT<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:20.160> maybe

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
and follow up with some VRT and maybe

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.650 
and follow up with some VRT and maybe
you'll<00:06:21.340> get<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.640> same<00:06:21.850> results<00:06:22.240> maybe<00:06:22.450> you'll

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
you'll get the same results maybe you'll

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.830 
you'll get the same results maybe you'll
get<00:06:22.870> better<00:06:23.560> results<00:06:24.100> but<00:06:25.000> any<00:06:25.270> little<00:06:25.720> bit

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
get better results but any little bit

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.870 
get better results but any little bit
helps
