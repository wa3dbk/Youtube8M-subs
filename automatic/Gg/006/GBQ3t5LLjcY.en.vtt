00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
alternate one to five scooter reason

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.610 
alternate one to five scooter reason
it's<00:00:06.060> called<00:00:06.120> Chris<00:00:06.450> Baltimore<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.140> two<00:00:07.319> five

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
it's called Chris Baltimore one two five

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.690 
it's called Chris Baltimore one two five
is<00:00:08.010> because<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.400> has<00:00:08.599> 125<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:10.050> their<00:00:10.170> wheels

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
is because it has 125 from their wheels

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.240 
is because it has 125 from their wheels
this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.759> putting<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.360> lot<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> people<00:00:12.990> off<00:00:13.250> this

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this is putting a lot of people off this

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
this is putting a lot of people off this
scooter<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.150> opinion<00:00:15.269> there<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.780> more

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
scooter but in my opinion there are more

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
scooter but in my opinion there are more
pros<00:00:16.289> than<00:00:16.320> cons<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
pros than cons to it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.670 
pros than cons to it
main<00:00:18.510> reason<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.170> you're<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> roll

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
main reason is that you're going to roll

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
main reason is that you're going to roll
smoother<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.400> most<00:00:20.820> surfaces<00:00:21.090> obviously<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
smoother on most surfaces obviously you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.480 
smoother on most surfaces obviously you
can<00:00:22.230> evolve<00:00:22.410> across<00:00:22.650> bricks<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.310> little

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
can evolve across bricks and little

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
can evolve across bricks and little
cracks<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> pavement<00:00:24.210> cracks<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.109> skate

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
cracks in the pavement cracks it skate

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
cracks in the pavement cracks it skate
parks<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> fire<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.730> evolve<00:00:26.970> over<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
parks to fire you can evolve over that a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150 
parks to fire you can evolve over that a
lot<00:00:27.900> easier<00:00:27.930> than<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> will<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.800> hundred

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
lot easier than you will with a hundred

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
lot easier than you will with a hundred
or<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> hundred<00:00:29.369> timber<00:00:30.000> wheels<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.990> going

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
or a hundred timber wheels they're going

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
or a hundred timber wheels they're going
to<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> lot<00:00:31.500> faster<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.759> you're
