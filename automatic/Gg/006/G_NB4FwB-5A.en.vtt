should download downloading like that
there's<00:03:36.729> a<00:03:36.879> predicted<00:03:37.479> time<00:03:37.659> but<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.079> not

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
there's a predicted time but it's not

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.050 
there's a predicted time but it's not
always<00:03:38.409> accurate<00:03:38.650> because<00:03:39.639> sometimes<00:03:39.939> just

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
always accurate because sometimes just

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.749 
always accurate because sometimes just
goes<00:03:40.359> down<00:03:40.540> really<00:03:40.840> fast<00:03:41.260> like<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.370> skips

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:42.759 
goes down really fast like it skips

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.749 
goes down really fast like it skips
numbers<00:03:43.239> sometimes<00:03:43.509> it's<00:03:43.930> pretty<00:03:44.139> weird<00:03:44.759> so

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
numbers sometimes it's pretty weird so

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:54.240 
numbers sometimes it's pretty weird so
yeah<00:03:46.000> that's<00:03:46.209> done<00:03:46.479> so<00:03:47.409> see<00:03:47.829> if<00:03:47.919> it<00:03:48.040> works

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
