00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 but without putting pressure on people who have 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 come to participate people who have 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 come to ask for your opportunity and the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 Today's first newspaper is called 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 worst for how old is almost 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:21.590
 two years almost two years ago and the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.590
 votes is smart and what is it called 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.130
 here we are going to locate and please 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.130
 He called from now no 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:44.059
 about an hour ago and he said 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 look what is saying that we are ready 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.420
 start calling her 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.210
 now for this certain bad that is 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 still 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.010
 area 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:20.750
 and I like it to be in a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.479
 confusion the rules of the game are a 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.869
 but for but I do not know how he did it 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.820
 case you told him vote vote to see or 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.439
 no and it was returned pérez that is 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.729
 incredible canis handling that is unusual 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.509
 smart the bitches wires that are 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.509
 unusual 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 one 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:08.030
 Bogota taught me some things there 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.489
 some tricks that came over the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.810
 puppy and chub that had muddied 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.810
 look and look 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.470
 I go back and it was returned and I'm missing 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.460
 the whole game said I have shown everything to you 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.070
 missing one told him isolated and he was devoted to 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.780
 see I want to look to see is that this game 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.990
 has only one rule 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.540
 when the dogs pass the pines and 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.579
 they are played 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.400
 they can not go through the rule again 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.620
 then half an hour in action to see 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.010
 I want to see if it happened with its entirety 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.900
 her body pines because having 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 it was from the repetition again that no 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.319
 see the repetition again because we're 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.319
 before saying so I have the smrtv there 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 I can not believe it to see look look there goes 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:14.540
 to see look I like it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.390
 I'm confused but it can be in 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.879
 this case within the rules of the game 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.170
 You have to understand them, but before that 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.819
 What are we looking at and what 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.519
 I would love to see it again I would give it 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.470
 one more chance is true only one 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.540
 opportunity more maybe you can not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.860
 come back another day but I have a 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.650
 opportunity more because the dog very 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.480
 smart first the rules the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.209
 rules are the rules got also 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.250
 I did not play against that but that of bernabé 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.630
 I want I want to see it very much jump the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.970
 dog 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.470
 let's see let me think about it stop thinking what 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.320
 that the direction of this program that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.630
 go down to compensate for the commercial break 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.130
 we are back with the decision of the case 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.130
 I feel like the doctor polo 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.910
 let's see what we do 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.670
 Y 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:38.789
 to do something that is ready 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.789
 because look 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.169
 I want I had it out of play 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.099
 vote vote vote 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.960
 again then let's meet with 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.540
 that commitment and that's why we closed the 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.220
 case you can come to participate from the 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.590
 next general course as much as you want 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.940
 if he continued to take the sporting and 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.920
 you have an opportunity more than a 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.920
 tremendous applause for it was but 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.950
 that I like today
