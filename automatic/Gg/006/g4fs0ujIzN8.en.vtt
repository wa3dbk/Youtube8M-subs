 guys this time is nourishing what 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.650
 which are the three best servers for 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.059
 minecraft okey from a 0.12 point 1 to 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.980

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.059
 the wii 9 ok guys and good before 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.190
 start with esteve I would like 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.050
 we got a goal guys and a beautiful 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.149
 goal of more than 500 light since it cost me 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.219
 quite get these servers already 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.570
 that the truth is that there are not many 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.920
 servers for what is minecraft in 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.560
 this moment and post cost me a lot 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.479
 get them and good guys we're going to 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220
 start with this and number one will be 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.110
 I forgive the number since I am already 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.490
 mistaking half the plague by initiating the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.470
 video that I'm saying and good guys 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.450
 place number 3 takes it what it is 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.550
 a splits server that is called 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.840
 hunger games' basically has what 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.940
 is an Englishman 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.979
 hunger games' excuse also has what 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.630
 that is explained also has what ok 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.369
 another subscriber that walk here 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.709
 raining subscribers too 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.000
 They have pizza split has parkour too 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.740
 he has what he writes 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.410
 it's super but super cool since 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.200
 allows 500 people but already allowing 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.700
 500 people may the server tv you 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 go a little bit the guide can not be 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.690
 say guys but that's why he won the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.000
 put number 3 and good guys we go with 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.920
 the number 2 place and here are some 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 subscribers hehe let's go with the post 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 number 2 and good guys in the post 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.619
 number 2 you will find what are the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.700
 hawk and william which is one of the best 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.420
 servers that there are for minecraft 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.860
 occasion 0.12 points 0.1 ok guys like 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.300
 you want to call and well it 's one of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.460
 the best server since this 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.399
 server does not give you anything of the and it's 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.229
 compatible for the 0.12 point 1 widgets 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.090
 and so I think it's one of the best 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.160
 servers for minecraft but that is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.410
 a little bit worse than the first 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.870
 that's why I say it because for example 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 this east deserves second place only 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 because the truth your server allows 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 only 40 people and that seems to me 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 something annoying because then if you want 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.140
 play seems annoying to me with beer 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.910
 of 40 people that's why it takes in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.130
 second place guys no more for that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 because the rest is a super but super 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.070
 saver and good guys we go with the post 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.070
 number one 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.890
 and well guys, we're back with the post 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.630
 number 1 since this is the best 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.180
 server for minecraft and site and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.400
 obviously as without hesitation it's going to be what 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.540
 that are the live board good guys this 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.610
 they are the best servers for 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.620
 little bit because they are the best 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.180
 good servers guys because the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.370
 true is the best server because no 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.590
 has what is a server that the truth 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.570
 It has a lot of people you can 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.460
 say and well I love I love this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.320

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.270
 variety basically and good guys yo 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.070
