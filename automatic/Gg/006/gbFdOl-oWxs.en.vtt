00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.580
 today I am going to concoct some 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 eight houses the ingredients for this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 recipe first of all i need to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690
 sugar 1 poetry of flour 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 it can be baking flour 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
 will give a softer cookie and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.199
 easier to handle cava de ' 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.189
 cooked I need sugar so from 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.219
 gelatin the other gelatin sachets 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.719
 the essence of vanilla first half salt or 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.700
 no hi and chocolate chips 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 first step of this recipe i'm going 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.489
 to make my shortbread dough for my little ones 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.969
 biscuits so rage forgot about the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 to mention but it takes 1.9 and also 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.199
 golden skin by the game is already 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.199
 mixed with mons when paul also has 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.809
 gimont sq powder montbard not bad 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.840
 that is to say which at room temperature 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.989
 still so soft but here it's still 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.200
 a block that will make a nice dough like 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.619
 that so I mix it is my bar with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.420
 mons than in hen then by the farms 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.930
 with mahmoud abbas but I could have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.549
 put my skin of the pop the flour the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 yeast is going to be writing something in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.799
 my discomfort that she abhors absorbs all the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 Granulated sugar 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:34.229
 quincy does that make a dough then the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:39.900
 even my time inside the good game 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 for a norway house and I 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.540
 mix everything when it's done so 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.259
 I have my flour space a little bit in my 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 bowl and I will send my mix of 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:05.130
 sugar butter 9.9 and the limit of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.129
 coming in will be helpful to mix on doing a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.660
 beautiful door with that in the apartment is 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.550
 pretty solid jal in sight of my bowl 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.140
 what is very sticky could put a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.140
 little bit of flour for his mouth - 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.720
 after the hymn to his cause - on the hands 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.570
 I could have done it at the mixer but I 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.390
 find that it is dirtying an instrument 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.840
 for nothing the quantity that I have this 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.390
 does very well at the shelter so when I have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.890
 a ball maimouni homogeneous form 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.600
 I have not made much flour you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.390
 did you see it was really unfair for 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.390
 they are easier to handle 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.630
 I will discover in a film 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.030
 plastic I'm going to let her rest 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.030
 about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.939
 you have about fifteen minutes my 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.700
 door is more shut door it shines 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.709
 it's still a pearl fragile and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.989
 crumble past made it is very 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.079
 friable and should not be too much work 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.190
 it's a bit like broken dough then 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:29.470
 if I get a little flour and I 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:34.489
 flatten it pretty thin with my rap out 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.760
 it was not suspicious 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.250
 still inflated a little and there with a 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.940
 cookie cutter or with a small glass 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:51.769
 I'm going to cut my flagship pieces 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.019
 cookies supercoms so here I have 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.170
 used but missed a second time 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.829
 reforma plowing and then I almost 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.730
 put flour 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.250
 I will read abc to redo biscuit 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.459
 with and then there I preheat the oven 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.500
 at 350 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.709
 I will send them about 8 to 10 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.959
 minutes now the most step 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.489
 interesting the most curious how 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.530
 do blais very easy level 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.169
 contrary to what one might think 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.289
 with magic has it here my name and my 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.990
 sugar ego birth become a point of 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:33.020
 our interesting taste but I'm going 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.610
 to make a spin move in a saucepan 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.060
 start again I put a part of my name 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.870

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.639
 dilute Latin magic of dago and I have 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.780

 pan and I'm going to wear his emulsion 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.990
 while it burns I go all of 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:06.310
 following our world with Latin magic is 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:08.110
 mixed I'm going to send it in my 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.850
 mixer in my glass of mixers 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.860

 come not to trade and neither 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.840
 it's ok like that just below 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.210
 the freeze sees that his loan with their 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.310
 little clubs who took it then if he 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.570
 was enough to put them 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.570
 side to let them cool 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.920
 how is created boiling and then picked 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.270
 dilute well in the water I sent it 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:47.760

 it will freeze a bit more but I want 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.330
 continue to whip until 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.930

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.900
 it's very soft went lukewarm and then 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.680
 it has already started frozen by becoming very 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.680
 interesting 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:39.540
 this is my superb move that people 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:42.910
 trailed frozen is still enough 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.830
