and don't push them too much the other

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.930 
and don't push them too much the other
problem<00:02:08.159> that<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:08.819> them

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
problem that we can see with them

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
problem that we can see with them
behavioral<00:02:09.300> wise<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.439> are

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
behavioral wise is because they are

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.709 
behavioral wise is because they are
really<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:11.099> intelligent<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> they<00:02:12.239> also<00:02:12.420> have

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
really so intelligent and they also have

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.750 
really so intelligent and they also have
quite<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> lot<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> energy<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.889> they<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.400> require

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
quite a lot of energy so they do require

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.720 
quite a lot of energy so they do require
quite

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
quite

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.940 
quite
a lot<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.000> exercise<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.959> mental<00:02:17.319> stimulation

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
a lot of exercise and mental stimulation

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.559 
a lot of exercise and mental stimulation
which<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.459> why<00:02:18.610> they're<00:02:19.060> brilliant<00:02:19.420> for

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
which is why they're brilliant for

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.059 
which is why they're brilliant for
things<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.870> your<00:02:20.230> agility<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.920> your

things like your agility like your

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.500 
things like your agility like your
flyball<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:21.970> why<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.180> make<00:02:22.330> great

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
flyball that's why they make great

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.850 
flyball that's why they make great
sniffer<00:02:22.930> dogs<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.230> know<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.440> really<00:02:23.709> need

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
sniffer dogs you know they really need

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.830 
sniffer dogs you know they really need
to<00:02:23.890> be<00:02:24.099> mentally<00:02:24.430> challenged<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.540> they<00:02:25.690> need

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
to be mentally challenged and they need

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.330 
to be mentally challenged and they need

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
to have quite a lot of exercise too

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.119 
to have quite a lot of exercise too
otherwise<00:02:28.239> they<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:29.080> again<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:29.980> can

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
otherwise they can get again they can

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.500 
otherwise they can get again they can
get<00:02:30.280> aggressive<00:02:30.519> they<00:02:30.849> can<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.150> destructive

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
get aggressive they can get destructive

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.180 
get aggressive they can get destructive
you<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:32.019> if<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.379> get<00:02:32.530> frustrated

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
you know if they just get frustrated

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.589 
you know if they just get frustrated
with<00:02:33.280> life<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.670> they're<00:02:33.849> if<00:02:34.150> they're<00:02:34.330> left

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
with life if they're if they're left

with life if they're if they're left
alone<00:02:34.900> all<00:02:35.110> day<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.470> they're<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.739> they're

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
alone all day and they're and they're

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
alone all day and they're and they're
not<00:02:36.040> dealt<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.700> appropriate<00:02:37.180> manner

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
not dealt with in the appropriate manner

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.869 
not dealt with in the appropriate manner
that<00:02:38.110> being<00:02:38.410> said<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.799> can<00:02:38.830> certainly<00:02:39.160> overdo

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
that being said you can certainly overdo

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.970 
that being said you can certainly overdo
it<00:02:39.910> too<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.420> if<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.629> do<00:02:40.750> too<00:02:41.080> much<00:02:41.260> agility<00:02:41.590> if

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
it too so if you do too much agility if

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.380 
it too so if you do too much agility if
you<00:02:42.069> do<00:02:42.220> too<00:02:42.400> much<00:02:42.519> flyball<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.269> too

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you do too much flyball if you do too

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240 
you do too much flyball if you do too
much<00:02:43.480> chasing<00:02:44.049> if<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.680> take<00:02:44.829> them<00:02:44.950> for<00:02:44.980> too

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
much chasing if you take them for too

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.800 
much chasing if you take them for too
long<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> walk<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.450> they<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.659> get<00:02:46.750> really

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
long a walk and they can get really

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.050 
long a walk and they can get really
excited<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.680> wound<00:02:47.890> up<00:02:48.069> too<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.549> really<00:02:48.879> is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
excited and wound up too so it really is

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.119 
excited and wound up too so it really is
a<00:02:49.110> balancing<00:02:50.110> act<00:02:50.230> between<00:02:50.349> giving<00:02:50.890> them

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
a balancing act between giving them

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.190 
a balancing act between giving them
enough<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:52.299> giving<00:02:52.599> them<00:02:52.690> enough<00:02:52.959> and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
enough and not giving them enough and

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.009 
enough and not giving them enough and
really<00:02:54.129> is<00:02:54.340> probably<00:02:55.150> not<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.480> dog<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.989> I

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
really is probably not a dog that I

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.660 
really is probably not a dog that I
would<00:02:56.200> recommend<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> first<00:02:57.190> time<00:02:57.430> dog

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
would recommend for the first time dog

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.970 
would recommend for the first time dog
owner<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.239> perhaps<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:59.079> families<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.620> with

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
owner and perhaps not families with with

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.319 
owner and perhaps not families with with
young<00:03:00.160> children<00:03:00.190> either<00:03:00.700> then<00:03:00.879> that's<00:03:01.000> not<00:03:01.150> to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
young children either then that's not to

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.490 
young children either then that's not to
say<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.660> they're<00:03:01.810> not<00:03:02.019> good<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.410> those

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
say that they're not good in those

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
say that they're not good in those
situations<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.879> they<00:03:04.030> are<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> very

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
situations but they are a very

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.869 
situations but they are a very
challenging<00:03:04.840> breed<00:03:05.379> and<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.099> more<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.700> than

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
challenging breed and so more so than

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.369 
challenging breed and so more so than
any<00:03:07.030> other<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.510> know<00:03:07.540> if<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.840> don't<00:03:08.109> have<00:03:08.260> the
