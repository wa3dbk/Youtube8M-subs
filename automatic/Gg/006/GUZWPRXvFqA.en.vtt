light<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.709> strong<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.060> instructions<00:03:22.599> have

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
light and strong the instructions have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.080 
light and strong the instructions have
come<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.170> package<00:03:23.380> all<00:03:23.799> about<00:03:24.160> need<00:03:25.000> to

to prevent water and dust entering which

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.949 
to prevent water and dust entering which
is<00:03:33.220> good<00:03:33.579> advice

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
is good advice

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.130 
is good advice
