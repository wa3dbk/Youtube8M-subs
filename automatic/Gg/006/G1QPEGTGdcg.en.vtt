wear it and stuff like that well he Sark
use<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:36.260> making<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> by

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
use a way of making them do that by

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
use a way of making them do that by
using<00:00:38.309> shooting<00:00:38.969> pumpkins<00:00:39.480> Adam<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.960> they

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
using shooting pumpkins Adam and they

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.340 
using shooting pumpkins Adam and they
would<00:00:40.710> wear<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.210> sunlight<00:00:42.989> because

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
would wear it get you sunlight because

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.549 
would wear it get you sunlight because
if<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.920> put<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.280> pumpkins<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:44.910> won't<00:00:45.120> die

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
if they put on pumpkins they won't die

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
if they put on pumpkins they won't die
by<00:00:46.559> sunlight<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> regular<00:00:48.360> zombies

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
by sunlight so all the regular zombies

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.580 
by sunlight so all the regular zombies
who<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.320> pick<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.860> pumpkin<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.850> die

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
who don't pick up the pumpkin will die

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.280 
who don't pick up the pumpkin will die
now<00:00:53.590> that<00:00:54.460> means<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:55.450> can<00:00:55.630> only<00:00:55.840> be<00:00:56.050> using

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
now that means you can only be using

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.700 
now that means you can only be using
this<00:00:56.560> at<00:00:56.950> day<00:00:57.340> time<00:00:57.630> for<00:00:58.630> me<00:00:58.780> however<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.320> don't

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
like that and I turned off the system so

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.910 
like that and I turned off the system so
what<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.530> way<00:01:17.800> this<00:01:18.040> guy<00:01:18.340> got<00:01:18.520> down<00:01:18.790> here<00:01:18.820> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
what this way this guy got down here so

what this way this guy got down here so
what's<00:01:20.920> supposed<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.460> happen<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:21.880> my<00:01:22.000> system

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
what's supposed to happen in my system

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.109 
what's supposed to happen in my system
is<00:01:22.540> when<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.410> zombie<00:01:23.860> comes<00:01:24.100> through<00:01:24.460> they'll

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
is when a zombie comes through they'll

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.730 
is when a zombie comes through they'll
check<00:01:25.479> whether<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.050> can<00:01:26.170> pick<00:01:26.410> up<00:01:26.590> that

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
check whether you can pick up that

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.700 
check whether you can pick up that
pumpkin<00:01:27.100> or<00:01:27.340> not<00:01:27.490> if<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.840> you'll<00:01:29.530> go

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
and if he can't he will be lured by the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.100 
and if he can't he will be lured by the
villager<00:01:37.830> by<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.760> piston<00:01:39.330> opening<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
villager by this piston opening up and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
villager by this piston opening up and
they'll<00:01:40.440> foster<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:41.280> lava<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> can

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
they'll foster into lava now you can

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
they'll foster into lava now you can
change<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> lava<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.190> know<00:01:44.310> an<00:01:44.460> XP<00:01:44.909> system

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
change the lava to you know an XP system

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
change the lava to you know an XP system
or<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.140> by<00:01:46.560> using<00:01:46.770> water

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
or something like that by using water

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
or something like that by using water
streams<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.659> dropping<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.229> straight

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
streams or just dropping them straight

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.090 
streams or just dropping them straight
down<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.290> yeah<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.530> actually<00:01:52.890> pretty

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
down and yeah it's actually pretty

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.450 
down and yeah it's actually pretty
simple<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.820> build<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> whole<00:01:54.420> machine<00:01:55.460> first

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
simple to build this whole machine first

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
simple to build this whole machine first
what<00:01:56.700> happened<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.200> zombie<00:01:58.530> land

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
what happened is when the zombie land

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.690 
what happened is when the zombie land
down<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.820> hit<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.720> trip<00:02:01.140> wire<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
down there they hit this trip wire and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
down there they hit this trip wire and
grows<00:02:02.700> through<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.300> timing<00:02:03.750> circuit<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
grows through this timing circuit as you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.279 
grows through this timing circuit as you
can<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.119> sticky<00:02:06.810> piston<00:02:06.990> down

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
can see there is a sticky piston down

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.949 
can see there is a sticky piston down
here<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.830> we<00:02:07.860> only<00:02:08.340> generate<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.090> one<00:02:09.360> tech<00:02:09.630> post

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
here so we only generate a one tech post

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.430 
here so we only generate a one tech post
that<00:02:10.649> goes<00:02:10.830> through<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.430> whole<00:02:11.640> thing<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
that goes through this whole thing and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.870 
that goes through this whole thing and
when<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> reached<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> will<00:02:14.670> turn

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
when it reached this here it will turn

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.150 
when it reached this here it will turn
off<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> redstone<00:02:15.690> torch<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.500> holding<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
glass block that is supposed to lead

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.540 
glass block that is supposed to lead
them<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.920> area<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:22.550> zombies

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
them to the area that have the zombies

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.740 
them to the area that have the zombies
that<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.959> hold<00:02:25.230> items<00:02:25.790> now<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.239> will

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that actually can hold items now it will

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
that actually can hold items now it will
also<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.350> into<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.209> RS<00:02:30.209> nor<00:02:30.420> latch<00:02:30.480> that

also go into this RS nor latch that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.060 
also go into this RS nor latch that

repeaters as you can see here and this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.210 
repeaters as you can see here and this
here<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.299> go<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.590> piston<00:02:44.070> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
here is to go into this little piston of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.930 
here is to go into this little piston of
course<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:46.739> are<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.220> zombie<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
course if they are a zombie that can

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
course if they are a zombie that can
pick<00:02:48.090> up<00:02:48.239> items<00:02:48.420> even<00:02:49.320> though<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.590> piston

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
pick up items even though this piston

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
pick up items even though this piston
still<00:02:50.280> open<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.329> low<00:02:51.570> sticky<00:02:52.019> piston<00:02:52.410> will

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
still open this low sticky piston will

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.979 
still open this low sticky piston will
open<00:02:52.950> first<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.549> they'll<00:02:54.239> go<00:02:54.269> down<00:02:54.510> instead

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
open first and they'll go down instead

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.479 
open first and they'll go down instead
of<00:02:55.320> go<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> let's<00:02:58.500> keep<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:59.040> here<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> bit

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
of go up so let's keep going here a bit

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.509 
of go up so let's keep going here a bit
let's<00:02:59.790> see<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.750> action<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.400> can

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
let's see it in action now as you can

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.740 
let's see it in action now as you can
see<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.660> piston<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> opening<00:03:04.829> up<00:03:04.980> because

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
see this piston is opening up because

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.509 
see this piston is opening up because
this<00:03:06.750> piston<00:03:07.200> down<00:03:07.320> here<00:03:07.590> cannot<00:03:08.010> open

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
this piston down here cannot open

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.220 
this piston down here cannot open
because<00:03:10.400> over<00:03:11.400> here<00:03:11.910> there's<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:12.600> item<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
because over here there's an item on the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.680 
because over here there's an item on the
pressure<00:03:13.470> plate<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.070> that's<00:03:14.610> creating<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.360> bud

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
pressure plate and that's creating a bud

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.470 
pressure plate and that's creating a bud
switch<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.040> piston<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.180> item

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
switch with the piston because the item

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.630 
switch with the piston because the item
is<00:03:18.600> right<00:03:18.750> here<00:03:19.110> just<00:03:19.739> diagonal<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
is right here just diagonal to the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.350 
is right here just diagonal to the
piston<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.950> also<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.280> ring<00:03:23.489> powering<00:03:24.209> this

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
piston so it's also a ring powering this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.750 
piston so it's also a ring powering this
block<00:03:24.720> which<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.019> updating<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.769> piston

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
block which is updating the piston

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.100 
block which is updating the piston

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
want the zombie tweet in that water

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.630

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
your items and once you kill the zombie

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.910 
your items and once you kill the zombie
he'll<00:04:14.090> return<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.780> all<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.290> drops<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.800> you

he'll return you all the drops that you
just<00:04:16.040> picked<00:04:16.280> up<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:17.270> you'll<00:04:17.540> be<00:04:17.720> getting<00:04:18.020> all
