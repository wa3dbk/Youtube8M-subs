00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.470 
tattoo the i don't know exactly how they
describe<00:03:13.739> them<00:03:14.100> probably<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.180> cream

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
describe them probably just cream

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.210 
describe them probably just cream
eyeshadows<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:16.739> really<00:03:17.040> really

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
eyeshadows but these are really really

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180 
eyeshadows but these are really really
similar<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.850> Mac<00:03:18.180> Paint<00:03:18.510> Pots<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.190> i

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
similar to the Mac Paint Pots and i

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.890 
similar to the Mac Paint Pots and i
actually<00:03:20.370> prefer<00:03:20.790> these<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> Mac<00:03:21.660> Paint

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
actually prefer these to the Mac Paint

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.540 
actually prefer these to the Mac Paint
Pots<00:03:22.140> because<00:03:22.620> they<00:03:22.920> have<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> lot<00:03:23.430> more

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
Pots because they have a lot more

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.430 
Pots because they have a lot more
pigmentation<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.450> color<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.959> them<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
pigmentation and color to them and I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
pigmentation and color to them and I
find<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.860> paint<00:03:26.100> pots<00:03:26.310> are<00:03:26.520> less<00:03:26.790> of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
find that the paint pots are less of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.840 
find that the paint pots are less of
like<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> cream<00:03:27.660> color<00:03:28.170> eyeshadow<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:29.190> more<00:03:29.520> of

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
like a cream color eyeshadow and more of

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.190 
like a cream color eyeshadow and more of
like<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.170> guess<00:03:31.170> sheer<00:03:31.890> base<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.670> your<00:03:32.760> eyelids

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
like a guess sheer base for your eyelids

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.840

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 
because it's not dark and you don't well

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.630

it's<00:07:42.900> it<00:07:43.170> is<00:07:43.320> dark<00:07:43.620> but<00:07:43.830> it's<00:07:44.010> not<00:07:44.280> like

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:44.640 
it's it is dark but it's not like

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.280 
it's it is dark but it's not like
completely<00:07:45.120> pigmented<00:07:45.840> so<00:07:45.990> if<00:07:46.080> you're<00:07:46.260> a

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.290 
completely pigmented so if you're a

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.110 
completely pigmented so if you're a
beginner<00:07:46.470> with<00:07:46.860> more<00:07:47.040> darker<00:07:47.460> or<00:07:47.700> brighter

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
beginner with more darker or brighter

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.960 
beginner with more darker or brighter
colored<00:07:48.570> or<00:07:48.960> more<00:07:49.680> standout<00:07:50.310> lips<00:07:50.640> then<00:07:50.910> i

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
colored or more standout lips then i

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.220 
colored or more standout lips then i
would<00:07:51.120> recommend<00:07:51.540> going<00:07:51.570> with<00:07:51.780> a<00:07:51.900> sheer

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.230 
would recommend going with a sheer

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.470 
would recommend going with a sheer
finish<00:07:52.650> because<00:07:52.860> it's<00:07:53.160> easier<00:07:53.520> to<00:07:53.730> apply<00:07:53.970> and

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480 
finish because it's easier to apply and

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.660 
finish because it's easier to apply and
you<00:07:54.630> can<00:07:54.780> build<00:07:54.990> it<00:07:55.140> up<00:07:55.290> and<00:07:55.560> it<00:07:55.620> won't<00:07:55.830> show

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:56.670 
you can build it up and it won't show

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.570 
you can build it up and it won't show
mistakes<00:07:57.270> as<00:07:57.510> easily<00:07:57.740> so<00:07:58.740> i<00:07:58.770> really<00:07:59.190> love<00:07:59.430> this
