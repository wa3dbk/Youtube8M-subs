 Bulgari RVF Switzerland March 26th 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.670
 for 2012 lowered target 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.100
 strange Kenzie Alter the weird Kenzie thinks Dirk draws with 1 1 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.109
 was 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.359
 a duel between two teams of group g in the previous part of the qualification 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.980
 pretty disappointed 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.449
 Bulgaria and Switzerland were expected to fight for second place 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.400
 premier 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.859
 but Montenegro has all 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.359
 and so these two teams fight for third place 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.239
 the winner remains in the race while the loser is the euro 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.500
 Can eat 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.930
 this will be an interesting duel between the two coaches and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.320
 between Matheus on one side and Hitzfeld on the other 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.940
 begin 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.690
 26 very March 2011 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.699
 11 to 17 45 Bulgarian football is in deep crisis 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.370
 In the past they had a national team which had a big one 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.780
 crack 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.360
 did not deserve 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.960
 Invited they were almost invincible and now they are in one 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.030
 such a situation that they already have their II 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.420
 have earned 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.480
 First they were in the Wembley Stadium of England with a 4 2 0 speech 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.640
 Names and then they conceded an unexpected 0-1 home defeat 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 Montenegro 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.320
 They celebrated a minimal win in Wales 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 in three completed test 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.650
 a victory Saudi Arabia a defeat Serbia and a draw Estonia 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 the biggest stars in this team are Martina and uphill 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.760
 the commitment of the new coach Lothar Matthäus is just the proof 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.920
 for that the Bulgarians are in a deep crisis 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.140
 stuck and this famous german should try to have a positive mood in the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.680
 To create a team 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.770
 midfielder jahn-coach will miss this match 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.270
 we can probably make some changes 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.159
 the starting lineup with which coach Matthias will surprise everyone 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.219
 expected installation 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.420
 Position Bulgaria Nieheim Mio 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.960
 Ivanov numbers 11 bodurov 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.510
 Georgiev Aspect of MP Prof sticks never Popov you get 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.479
 The Swiss have so far against the same opponents as Bulgaria 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.889
 it is interesting that they have achieved the same results only the 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.309
 Goal difference and the power of the appearance were different 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.929
 the Swiss have first 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.439
 measure and cashed one 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.119
 one to three home defeat 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:46.009
 after that they have delivered a guest appearance in Podgorica where they have a pure 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.919
 have retracted to zero defeat 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.969
 in Valais, they triumphed with a 4 2 1 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.829
 the advantage is that they defeat the Montenegrins in the distance 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.269
 have cashed 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.469
 but if they do not win in this game, they will hardly be 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.139
 Can reach playoffs 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.449
 the first place 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.479
 In the meantime, they have two friends 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.749
 Games with the Ukrainian 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.749
 graduated from them and Malta and every time 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.099
 quickly and was the goalless draw against Malta 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.620
 We see that they take a look at the starting line-up of the Swiss 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.259
 over 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:27.349
 we dispose 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.789
 However, coach Hitzfeld had in these encounters on the goalkeeper 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:36.749
 Benaglio and Barnetta forgo but the AMI and Derdiyok are again 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.989
 there 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.950
 that does dangerous storm duo pay from Barßel 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.590
 Streller plays together again and each defensive line would therefore 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.229
 to care 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.609
 but they must show us the results 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.379
 CERN national team Dr 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.269
 something is wrong 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.149
 they have to be tonight 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:59.009
 then because they want that the dream of performing in a big competition was 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.829
 becomes 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.290

 Egeler the AMI Lena "Yes Stocker 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.439
 This is a very difficult game to predict because the score 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.979
 are higher quality while the hosts have the home advantage 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.460
 "For both teams, there is a lot at stake, though 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.229

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.109
 maybe it's best this indicates
