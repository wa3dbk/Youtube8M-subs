 abaya line 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.720

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.409
 all banks are returning a little 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.409

 in the province about one party 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.499
 as they have no cards 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.469
 there are no cars 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.149

 we are their fact powerless 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.889
 As you can see 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.769
 the score is equal 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.769

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.650
 occupying 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.509
 This part of the assembly is not giving the opponent if 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.469
