on<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.989> circuit<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.440> well<00:00:58.620> not<00:00:58.769> quite<00:00:58.980> like

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
on this circuit as well not quite like

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.779 
on this circuit as well not quite like
the<00:00:59.489> modern<00:00:59.760> tires<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.149> today<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> southern

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the modern tires of today and southern

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
the modern tires of today and southern
loops<00:01:02.969> definitely<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> lot<00:01:03.539> bumpier<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
loops definitely a lot bumpier to what I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.930 
loops definitely a lot bumpier to what I
remember<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> last<00:01:04.860> year<00:01:05.160> and<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.790> new

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and then again the brakes getting such a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
and then again the brakes getting such a
workout<00:01:21.900> into<00:01:22.620> into<00:01:23.100> Honda<00:01:23.370> corner<00:01:23.730> back<00:01:23.970> down

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
workout into into Honda corner back down

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.390

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
back down to second gear and here in mg

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.860 
back down to second gear and here in mg
is<00:01:29.550> where<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.760> really<00:01:30.030> struggles<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.660> the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
is where it really struggles the the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.180 
is where it really struggles the the
Honda<00:01:31.140> doesn't<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.530> handle<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
Honda doesn't quite handle like that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.650 
Honda doesn't quite handle like that
makes<00:01:32.340> Norton's<00:01:32.760> but<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.120> faster<00:01:33.480> corners

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
makes Norton's but the faster corners

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.110 
makes Norton's but the faster corners
and<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.290> likes<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.670> always<00:01:38.790> try

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
and it really likes it and I always try

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.670 
and it really likes it and I always try
and<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.390> about<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.690> Exeter<00:01:40.080> Siberia<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and think about the Exeter Siberia you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.290 
and think about the Exeter Siberia you
can<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.010> such<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.220> good<00:01:41.460> run<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:41.850> hey

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
can get such a good run through hey
