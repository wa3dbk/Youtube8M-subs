00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.980
 today on your samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.230
 I can use Android 4.4 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.769
 the whole thing with me for a so-called 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.650
 custom rom the guys of omnicom are here 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.280
 already furthest and currently have am 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.060
 least bugs and mistakes on good us 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.010
 Of course, such a few have to 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.020
 meet basic requirements on the one hand 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.960
 our device must be rooted 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.940
 we need a root recovery i use 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.440
 here, for example, team green in the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.270
 version 2.6.31 and we need 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.190
 of course a few files we here 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.860
 on our device before we get it in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 put recovery mode boats down 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.580
 the files are unique yet shows them 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.560
 of course, the here the fast 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.070
 google apps in version 4.4 and 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.400
 of course the just mentioned space file 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.840
 the android 4.4 based well if we 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.850
 have created the basic requirement 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.580
 then we can start and I'll start 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.030
 once clock and switch the phone 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.030
 out here 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.770
 so and we want the little one 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.770
 but stay here now our phone 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.980
 I boot in camera mode 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.290
 here once the louder rocker up 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 the homebutton down here and the power 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.600
 button right at the side at the same time 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.780
 So louder rocker home-button and the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.730
 press and hold the power button until 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.880
 we're here right now in red recovery 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.610
 Mode so in team mode here with me 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.020
 right here we are and from here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.490
 Now we can do all the necessary 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.119
 So we want to carry out the steps 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.369
 have something to install around now 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.970
 So here's the possibility to get into the all too 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.530
 I'll do that once and here 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.119
 are now our files filed you 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.790
 can up here one more time back and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.010
 If you are now on the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.200
 micro sd card has filed in my 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.160
 case here is internal and storage and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.660
 you see these already listening 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.840
 two files that I have filed 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.850
 once in the room and the apps we catch 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.100
 than then and install around the room 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.970
 this file we go out and can 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 down here now with 25 flash this file 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.989
 directly install 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.459
 we now see the omnium banner here 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.739
 and the installation process here 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.830
 the system is formatted and detail 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.830
 Extract the whole thing now takes one 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.450
 little way and should be in connection with 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.190
 a successful message so to speak 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.190
 confirmed here 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.709
 that's exactly what is here now 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.840
 successful yes we can now once 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.480
 go back that we do here and 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.489
 then choose our google now 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.780
 Of course we need apps from them 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 as well as here again 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.030
 once right over to see second below 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.090
 we that paid apps banner and the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.349
 installation process which also relatively 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.349
 should go quickly 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 so 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.319
 just that is the time here 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.079
 as successful we can from here 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.829
 choose further away or even once 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.930
 return 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.280
 again back up here in the area voip 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.349
 I do not leave the second one directly 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.430
 of format or something here that need 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.269
 We will not be spoiled 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.730
 We can argue about around here all 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.359
 data to expand so to speak 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.250
 accordingly, of course, that is clear 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.530
 all your data will be lost 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.730
 Of course, this should stop beforehand 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.379
 secure once 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.900
 well we have the opportunity now 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.510
 reboot to choose to do that at x and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.250
 then say reboot system like that and now 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.889
 do not get restless that lasts now 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.470
 a little while until the whole time 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.470
 the device is restarted completely 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.970
 yes, we can see right here right there 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.140
 is the omnicom startscreen so to speak 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.370
 I have all now but each 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.890
 a bit longer takes time 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.430
 cut to size 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.530
 in connection it is just the device 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.460
 must unlock 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.710
 I already have this here 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.520
 done and you can then as usual 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.370
 just choose your language you can 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:15.340
 then a wlan login also have that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:18.460
 i here once of course abbreviated her 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.080
 you can also go to your google 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.030
 and report to a google account 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.030
 as I do the same in connection 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.530
 exactly 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.300
 That's what happened recently and now 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.150
 it takes just a few more minutes 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.580
 until the first social easy tion here 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.950
 gone through and you that 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.950
 can fall into the full extent use 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.680
 therefore, the actual ones are also 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.790
 google-service query your name here 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.340
 register if you want it exactly and 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.480
 the facility has been completed so far 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.320
 I have now assumed that from here 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.410

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.940

 Manufacturer instructions always here now 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.220

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.740
 to set up or where to get the 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.970
