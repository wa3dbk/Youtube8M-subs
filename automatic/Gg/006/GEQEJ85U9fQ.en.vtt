using the remote control - English press
ok<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.300> we're<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.390> Perth<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.020> we're<00:00:36.170> going<00:00:36.260> to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
ok and we're in Perth so we're going to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:45.040 
ok and we're in Perth so we're going to
pick<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:37.719> zone<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:38.750> us<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:43.780> once<00:00:44.780> we're<00:00:44.989> in

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
pick a zone for us and once we're in

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.050 
pick a zone for us and once we're in
here<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:45.470> need<00:00:45.560> to<00:00:45.620> set<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.040> Edition<00:00:46.610> for<00:00:46.970> the

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
here we need to set up Edition for the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.130 
here we need to set up Edition for the
various<00:00:47.390> satellites

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.560 

so<00:00:50.770> it's<00:00:50.950> got<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> name<00:00:51.340> up<00:00:51.520> here<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:52.300> we'll

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
so it's got the name up here and we'll

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.080 
so it's got the name up here and we'll
just<00:00:52.870> head<00:00:53.260> at<00:00:53.380> the<00:00:53.440> satellite<00:00:53.710> now<00:00:53.980> press<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
just head at the satellite now press the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.330 
just head at the satellite now press the
red<00:00:55.240> button<00:00:55.510> on<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.630> remote<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:57.040> hit<00:00:57.220> in

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
red button on the remote and you hit in

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
red button on the remote and you hit in
there<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:57.580> you<00:00:57.640> can<00:00:57.760> change<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.180> name<00:00:58.360> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there and you can change the name so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.570 
there and you can change the name so
we're<00:00:59.710> going<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.890> call<00:01:00.040> this<00:01:00.160> one<00:01:00.220> our

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
we're going to call this one our

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
we're going to call this one our
obviously<00:01:01.150> one

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.710 

yes<00:01:17.749> of<00:01:18.749> this

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:34.740 

say

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.620 

there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
there

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890 
there
so<00:01:37.200> we've<00:01:37.350> been<00:01:37.530> down<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> satellite<00:01:38.900> frequency

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so we've been down a satellite frequency

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.420 
so we've been down a satellite frequency
we<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.590> use<00:01:40.909> 1<00:01:41.909> 2<00:01:42.479> 4<00:01:42.810> 8<00:01:42.840> 7<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.070> we'll<00:01:44.250> just

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
we want use 1 2 4 8 7 so we'll just

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
we want use 1 2 4 8 7 so we'll just
scroll<00:01:44.700> across<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.659> find

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.960 

that's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.649> we'll<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
that's not there so we'll go to

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.109 
that's not there so we'll go to
user-defined<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:02.610> kept<00:02:02.820> scrolling

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
user-defined so the kept scrolling

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.550 
user-defined so the kept scrolling
across<00:02:05.479> set<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.570> beyond<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.610> single

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.410

10700<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.890> punch<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.250> 210<00:02:11.489> 700<00:02:12.090> using<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
10700 we punch in 210 700 using the

10700 we punch in 210 700 using the
remote<00:02:14.209> 100<00:02:15.230> then<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.290> press<00:02:16.470> ok<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.250> that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
remote 100 then we press ok and that's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.220
