00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

our<00:00:00.120> group<00:00:00.480> began<00:00:00.900> by<00:00:01.230> finding<00:00:01.740> some<00:00:01.920> designs

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
our group began by finding some designs

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.999 
our group began by finding some designs
online<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.179> figured<00:00:03.899> that<00:00:03.929> triangles<00:00:04.830> would

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
online and figured that triangles would

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.950 
online and figured that triangles would
be<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.310> best<00:00:05.520> shape<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.879> build<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.480> chair<00:00:06.750> out

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
be the best shape to build a chair out

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.650 
be the best shape to build a chair out
of<00:00:07.490> then<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.610> begin<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> brainstorm<00:00:09.450> by

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
of then we begin to brainstorm by

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.080 
of then we begin to brainstorm by
creating<00:00:10.019> some<00:00:10.200> mini<00:00:10.380> models<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.790> then<00:00:11.969> we

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
creating some mini models and then we

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.860 
creating some mini models and then we
also<00:00:12.300> drew<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.019> sketches

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
also drew some sketches

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.630 
also drew some sketches
after<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:15.990> sketched<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:17.250> made<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
after we sketched this we made a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.580 
after we sketched this we made a
whiteboard<00:00:18.090> drawing<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.990> wish<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
whiteboard drawing of what we wish to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.130 
whiteboard drawing of what we wish to
achieve<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:21.060> begin<00:00:21.420> implementing<00:00:21.869> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
achieve and then begin implementing that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.730 
achieve and then begin implementing that
by<00:00:22.769> rapidly<00:00:23.279> prototyping<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.680> creating<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
by rapidly prototyping and creating a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.820 
by rapidly prototyping and creating a
miniature<00:00:26.160> model<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:28.019> big<00:00:28.199> version<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
miniature model of the big version of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
miniature model of the big version of
what<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.099> wanted<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> accomplish<00:00:30.740> all<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
what we wanted to accomplish all of the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.790 
what we wanted to accomplish all of the
cuts<00:00:32.189> were<00:00:32.340> precise<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.989> actual<00:00:34.380> model

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
cuts were precise and the actual model

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.729 
cuts were precise and the actual model
held<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.610> weight<00:00:38.809> now<00:00:39.809> after<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.440> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
held some weight now after this we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.869 
held some weight now after this we
tested<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.629> model<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.340> found<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
tested this model and found that it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
tested this model and found that it
still<00:00:45.180> needed<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.989> support<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> front

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
still needed some support in the front

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
still needed some support in the front
so<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> went<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> ups<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:48.899> told<00:00:49.110> us<00:00:49.230> about

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so we went to ups and they told us about

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
so we went to ups and they told us about
how<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:50.129> stronger<00:00:50.340> materials<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.690> refined

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
how to use stronger materials we refined

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
how to use stronger materials we refined
our<00:00:52.410> design<00:00:52.829> by<00:00:53.399> adding<00:00:53.550> another<00:00:54.000> triangle<00:00:54.660> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
our design by adding another triangle on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
our design by adding another triangle on
the<00:00:55.230> bottom<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.100> cutting<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.610> slits

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the bottom and then cutting more slits

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
the bottom and then cutting more slits
into<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> cardboard<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> support<00:00:58.260> more

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
into the cardboard to support more

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090 
into the cardboard to support more
weight<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> final<00:01:01.680> version

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
weight so now we had a final version

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160 
weight so now we had a final version
that<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:03.239> able<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> support<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:03.989> more

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that was able to support a lot more

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
that was able to support a lot more
weight<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.769> were<00:01:04.830> find<00:01:05.159> again<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:06.000> adding<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
weight they were find again by adding a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
weight they were find again by adding a
handle<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> chair<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.189> order

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
handle to the back of the chair in order

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.179 
handle to the back of the chair in order
to<00:01:08.820> transport<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.689> chair<00:01:10.439> around<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> room

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to transport this chair around the room

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.840 
to transport this chair around the room
easily

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.220 

we<00:01:15.850> implemented<00:01:16.270> all<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.690> these<00:01:16.840> design

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
we implemented all of these design

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.920 
we implemented all of these design
features<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:18.220> make<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.430> handled<00:01:19.030> three-legged

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
features to make a handled three-legged

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.470 
features to make a handled three-legged
chair<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:21.070> could<00:01:21.220> support<00:01:21.580> up<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.090> 200

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
chair that could support up to 200

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.020 
chair that could support up to 200
pounds<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.050> weighs<00:01:23.620> only<00:01:23.830> 32<00:01:24.520> ounces

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.010 

actually<00:01:31.030> works<00:01:31.950> good<00:01:32.950> for<00:01:32.980> you<00:01:33.190> guys<00:01:33.310> bed

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
actually works good for you guys bed

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.399 
actually works good for you guys bed
like<00:01:35.620> people<00:01:36.159> doing<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.140> what<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.260> think

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
like people doing this so what you think

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.050 
like people doing this so what you think
it<00:01:38.530> sure<00:01:38.650> can<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.400> lean<00:01:39.610> back

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
it sure can I lean back

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.649 
it sure can I lean back
yeah<00:01:40.330> before<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:43.030> afraid<00:01:43.390> it's<00:01:43.570> gonna

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
yeah before it I'm afraid it's gonna

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.280 
yeah before it I'm afraid it's gonna
fall<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:45.040> works

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.510 

what<00:01:50.890> are<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.040> what<00:01:51.190> are<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:51.340> impressions

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
what are you what are your impressions

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.390 
what are you what are your impressions
what<00:01:51.820> do<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.940> think<00:01:52.150> ah<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:54.040> phrase

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
what do you think ah a little phrase

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.400 
what do you think ah a little phrase
that<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.760> gonna<00:01:54.940> break<00:01:55.210> sitting<00:01:55.720> down<00:01:55.960> but

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that is gonna break sitting down but

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.580 
that is gonna break sitting down but
feels<00:01:56.980> pretty<00:01:57.250> sturdy
