00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:07.269 

so<00:00:04.939> this<00:00:05.060> is<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:05.240> boom<00:00:05.390> stand<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:06.740> design

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
so this is the boom stand the design

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.209 
so this is the boom stand the design
basically<00:00:08.180> allows<00:00:08.480> you<00:00:08.840> to<00:00:08.870> get<00:00:09.290> a<00:00:09.530> number<00:00:10.130> of

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
basically allows you to get a number of

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.360 
basically allows you to get a number of
different<00:00:10.340> angles<00:00:11.170> with<00:00:12.170> one<00:00:12.500> wing<00:00:12.769> nut<00:00:13.040> you

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
different angles with one wing nut you

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.579 
different angles with one wing nut you
can<00:00:13.549> have<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.089> much<00:00:14.240> mobility<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:15.200> move<00:00:15.380> this

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
can have so much mobility to move this

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.850 
can have so much mobility to move this
any<00:00:15.889> way<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.189> want<00:00:16.989> one<00:00:17.989> wing<00:00:18.230> nut<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:18.739> can

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
any way you want one wing nut you can

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.200 
any way you want one wing nut you can
get<00:00:18.950> a<00:00:18.980> variety<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.489> angles<00:00:19.759> I<00:00:21.790> could<00:00:22.790> rotate

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
get a variety of angles I could rotate

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.339 
get a variety of angles I could rotate
it<00:00:23.649> 360<00:00:24.649> degrees<00:00:25.540> multiple<00:00:26.540> ways<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.079> you<00:00:27.169> can

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
it 360 degrees multiple ways so you can

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.859 
it 360 degrees multiple ways so you can
bend<00:00:28.309> it<00:00:28.369> this<00:00:28.550> way<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:28.880> can<00:00:29.390> rotate<00:00:29.630> it

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
bend it this way you can rotate it

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.220 
bend it this way you can rotate it
around<00:00:31.480> does<00:00:32.620> whatever<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:34.370> want<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.820> do

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
around does whatever you want it to do

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.190 
around does whatever you want it to do
it's<00:00:36.230> just<00:00:36.530> one<00:00:37.480> loosen<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.780> but<00:00:39.020> does

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
it's just one loosen of that but does

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.620 
it's just one loosen of that but does
everything<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.160> first<00:00:40.490> thing<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:41.060> it<00:00:41.450> does

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
everything the first thing that it does

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.910 
everything the first thing that it does
is<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:43.220> can<00:00:43.430> rotate<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.180> whole<00:00:44.380> food<00:00:45.380> section

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
is you can rotate the whole food section

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.860 
is you can rotate the whole food section
the<00:00:46.520> second<00:00:47.300> thing<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:47.600> do<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:49.540> this<00:00:50.540> movement

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
the second thing you do is this movement

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.860 
the second thing you do is this movement
and<00:00:51.200> then<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:52.130> third<00:00:52.370> one<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:54.130> but<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:56.630> cool

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
and then the third one is but the cool

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.960 
and then the third one is but the cool
thing<00:00:57.050> about<00:00:57.079> this<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.890> can<00:00:58.010> be<00:00:58.070> both<00:00:58.579> a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
thing about this is it can be both a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.120 
thing about this is it can be both a
boom<00:00:59.390> stand<00:00:59.660> or<00:00:59.870> straight<00:01:00.200> stand<00:01:00.470> and<00:01:00.800> if<00:01:01.010> you

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
boom stand or straight stand and if you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.490 
boom stand or straight stand and if you
want<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.550> be<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:01.730> single<00:01:02.570> straight<00:01:03.230> stand

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
want to be a single straight stand

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500 
want to be a single straight stand
without<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:04.070> boom<00:01:04.280> all<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:05.089> do<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.390> you

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
without the boom all you do is you

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.060 
without the boom all you do is you
unscrew<00:01:06.140> pull<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.070> out<00:01:07.220> pull<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.330> boom<00:01:08.540> out

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
unscrew pull it out pull the boom out

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.430 
unscrew pull it out pull the boom out
put<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.190> Elrod<00:01:10.700> here<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:12.350> a

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
put the Elrod here and now it's a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.140 
put the Elrod here and now it's a
straight<00:01:12.740> stick<00:01:13.040> we<00:01:13.370> move<00:01:13.580> down<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.820> little<00:01:13.909> bit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
straight stick we move down a little bit

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.550 
straight stick we move down a little bit
lower<00:01:14.330> you've<00:01:14.630> got<00:01:14.810> these<00:01:14.990> double<00:01:15.350> braced

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
lower you've got these double braced

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.469 
lower you've got these double braced
legs<00:01:15.740> here<00:01:16.370> which<00:01:16.850> creates<00:01:17.060> amazing

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
legs here which creates amazing

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.560 
legs here which creates amazing
stability<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.590> feet<00:01:18.979> are<00:01:19.790> much<00:01:20.060> bigger<00:01:20.299> than

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
stability the feet are much bigger than

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.840 
stability the feet are much bigger than
most<00:01:20.720> stands<00:01:21.290> really<00:01:22.100> anchoring<00:01:22.700> these

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
most stands really anchoring these

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.300 
most stands really anchoring these
things<00:01:23.120> into<00:01:24.080> into<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.620> ground<00:01:24.860> into<00:01:25.280> your

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
things into into the ground into your

interior stage obviously the double

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.000 
interior stage obviously the double
brace<00:01:28.280> adds<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.940> weight<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:30.619> overall

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
brace adds to the weight and the overall

are<00:02:16.380> even<00:02:16.680> improved<00:02:17.040> Thomas<00:02:17.520> came<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.850> with<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
are even improved Thomas came up with a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.210 
are even improved Thomas came up with a
cool<00:02:18.240> idea<00:02:18.420> where<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.230> still<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.920> felt

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
cool idea where you still have the felt

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.430 
cool idea where you still have the felt
touching<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> symbol<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.810> they're<00:02:22.020> hollowed

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
touching the symbol but they're hollowed
