gun take off the also doubt
about<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> sometimes<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
about this sometimes but when you

go<00:02:09.599> forward

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.030 

sometimes<00:02:12.990> i<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.410> from<00:02:13.910> whenever<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> pleases

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040

rocket<00:02:43.410> launcher<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.560> see

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
rocket launcher so you know you can see

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.570 
rocket launcher so you know you can see
when<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.880> put<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> starting<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
when I put the starting and if it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.450 
when I put the starting and if it
and<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.240> top<00:02:51.510> forward<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.530> dart<00:02:53.010> will<00:02:53.370> shoot

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
and the top forward the dart will shoot

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.780 
and the top forward the dart will shoot
so<00:02:56.460> yeah<00:02:56.610> I'm<00:02:57.270> do<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.720> gun<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.710> mod<00:02:59.070> left

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
the pocket you have to take out this

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.620 
the pocket you have to take out this
take<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.520> cocking<00:03:05.520> thing<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.000> once

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
take out the cocking thing one once

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.090 
take out the cocking thing one once
you've<00:03:06.780> unscrewed<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.380> gun<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:10.100> get

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
you've unscrewed the gun and then get

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.100 
you've unscrewed the gun and then get
spring<00:03:12.170> there<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:15.110> along

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
spring there like right in there along

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.830 
spring there like right in there along
the<00:03:16.140> cocking<00:03:16.980> thing<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.370> romantic<00:03:17.670> huh<00:03:18.030> you

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the cocking thing it's romantic huh you

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.680 
the cocking thing it's romantic huh you
have<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.170> replace<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.490> same<00:03:20.820> size<00:03:21.180> spring

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
have to replace it the same size spring

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.920 
have to replace it the same size spring
or<00:03:21.990> our<00:03:22.800> spring<00:03:23.310> as<00:03:23.580> close<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> side<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.900> it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
or our spring as close to the side to it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.320 
or our spring as close to the side to it
dealing<00:03:25.860> with<00:03:26.010> width<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.490> length<00:03:26.640> both<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
dealing with width and length both the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.810 
dealing with width and length both the
same<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.770> sensitivity<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
same but the sensitivity of the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.210 
same but the sensitivity of the
replacement<00:03:30.570> spring<00:03:30.810> has<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.320> much<00:03:31.650> softy

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
replacement spring has to be much softy

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.900 
replacement spring has to be much softy
of<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.460> stretching<00:03:32.910> out<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.390> good<00:03:33.570> and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
of the stretching out really good and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.820 
of the stretching out really good and
make<00:03:35.910> sure<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.360> sensitive<00:03:37.140> spring<00:03:37.880> right

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
make sure it's a sensitive spring right

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.830 
make sure it's a sensitive spring right
also<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.040> know<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> mark<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.480> listen

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
also I know this is a mark as you listen

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.940 
also I know this is a mark as you listen
to<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.050> real<00:03:43.290> closer<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:48.540> has<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.020> thing<00:03:49.350> so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
to it real closer it has that thing so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.820 
to it real closer it has that thing so
at<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:51.060> end<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:51.930> modern<00:03:52.380> earth<00:03:52.560> might

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
at the end like my modern earth might

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.720 
at the end like my modern earth might
find<00:03:53.130> her<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:55.530> also<00:03:55.740> makes<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.310> sound<00:03:56.520> but

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
find her it also makes that sound but

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.190 
find her it also makes that sound but
it's<00:03:56.880> much<00:03:57.120> louder<00:03:57.390> than<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.840> one<00:03:58.020> has<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
it's much louder than this one has a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.620 
it's much louder than this one has a
little<00:03:58.320> air<00:03:58.530> restrictor<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.480> nice

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
little air restrictor but this is nice

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.660 
little air restrictor but this is nice
those<00:04:04.410> are<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.710> rule<00:04:04.920> there<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.190> sit<00:04:05.490> there

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
those are the rule there I sit there

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.080 
those are the rule there I sit there
outfit<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.240> still<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:06.990> this<00:04:07.230> glocca<00:04:07.650> Morra

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
outfit and still have this glocca Morra

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.660 
outfit and still have this glocca Morra
pretty<00:04:09.090> cool<00:04:09.530> she<00:04:10.530> was<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:10.830> far<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.400> yup

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
pretty cool she was really far so yup

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.040 
pretty cool she was really far so yup
when<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.000> take<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.210> spring<00:04:12.630> out<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:12.900> like

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
when you take that spring out in like

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.170 
when you take that spring out in like
this<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.530> shoot<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.160> rich<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.490> seven<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.910> 10

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
this and shoot a rich in seven to 10

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.140 
this and shoot a rich in seven to 10
feet<00:04:15.540> further<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.190> that's<00:04:17.190> pretty<00:04:17.730> decent

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
feet further and that's pretty decent

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.830 
feet further and that's pretty decent
improvement<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:21.150> yeah<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.390> can't<00:04:21.690> really

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
improvement so yeah I can't really

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.900 
improvement so yeah I can't really
explain<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.500> because<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.890> can't<00:04:23.430> really<00:04:23.669> do

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
explain to you because I can't really do

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.760 
explain to you because I can't really do
it<00:04:23.940> walkthrough<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> cuz

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it walkthrough for it cuz

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.270 
it walkthrough for it cuz
strip<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.849> screw<00:04:27.060> that
