guys although you heard of it you know
every<00:00:12.250> now<00:00:12.369> and<00:00:12.549> then<00:00:12.610> we<00:00:12.760> like<00:00:12.879> to<00:00:12.969> focus<00:00:13.150> on

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
every now and then we like to focus on

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.119 
every now and then we like to focus on
for<00:00:13.450> our<00:00:13.809> training<00:00:14.139> we're<00:00:14.379> out<00:00:14.440> of<00:00:14.469> here<00:00:14.710> so<00:00:15.099> I

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
for our training we're out of here so I

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.730 
for our training we're out of here so I
found<00:00:15.400> another<00:00:15.879> one<00:00:16.180> for<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.720> forearm<00:00:17.230> now

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
found another one for the forearm now

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.380 
found another one for the forearm now
this<00:00:17.890> was<00:00:18.130> different<00:00:18.430> what<00:00:19.090> makes<00:00:19.119> it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
this was different what makes it

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.970 
this was different what makes it
different<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:19.779> that<00:00:19.810> it's<00:00:20.080> not<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.259> traditional

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
different is that it's not a traditional

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.679 
different is that it's not a traditional
hand<00:00:21.279> gripper<00:00:21.669> but<00:00:21.820> essentially<00:00:22.270> is<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.480> same

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
hand gripper but essentially is the same

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.410 
hand gripper but essentially is the same
principles<00:00:23.289> now<00:00:23.949> if<00:00:24.609> you've<00:00:24.939> never<00:00:24.970> heard<00:00:25.210> of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
principles now if you've never heard of

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.419 
principles now if you've never heard of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
big at all it's easy to carry you can

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.530 
big at all it's easy to carry you can
throw<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:32.830> in<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> backpack<00:00:33.220> you<00:00:33.760> could<00:00:33.910> tell

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
throw it in a backpack you could tell

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.140 
throw it in a backpack you could tell
you<00:00:34.690> throw<00:00:34.900> it<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.080> a<00:00:35.140> briefcase<00:00:35.410> okay<00:00:36.250> well<00:00:37.059> it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
you throw it in a briefcase okay well it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.030 
you throw it in a briefcase okay well it
makes<00:00:37.330> this<00:00:37.480> thing<00:00:37.660> so<00:00:37.900> great<00:00:38.199> is<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.650> fact

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
makes this thing so great is the fact

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.560 
makes this thing so great is the fact
that<00:00:39.159> because<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:40.210> has<00:00:40.449> no<00:00:40.720> actual<00:00:42.269> grip<00:00:43.269> about

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that because it has no actual grip about

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.570 
that because it has no actual grip about
it<00:00:43.750> like<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.960> traditional<00:00:44.470> hand<00:00:44.710> gripper<00:00:45.159> you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
it like the traditional hand gripper you

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.189 
it like the traditional hand gripper you
don't<00:00:45.729> have<00:00:45.879> muscular<00:00:46.390> imbalances<00:00:47.080> between

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
don't have muscular imbalances between

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.780 
don't have muscular imbalances between
your<00:00:47.500> left<00:00:47.710> knee<00:00:47.830> or<00:00:47.920> right<00:00:48.100> hand<00:00:48.400> that<00:00:48.640> you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
your left knee or right hand that you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.549 
your left knee or right hand that you
get<00:00:49.059> with<00:00:49.299> the<00:00:49.420> traditional<00:00:49.869> hang<00:00:50.110> reference

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
get with the traditional hang reference

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.039 
get with the traditional hang reference
the<00:00:51.309> only<00:00:51.670> disadvantage<00:00:52.030> with<00:00:52.540> it<00:00:52.720> is<00:00:52.839> that<00:00:52.989> it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
the only disadvantage with it is that it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:54.960 
the only disadvantage with it is that it
only<00:00:53.140> goes<00:00:53.440> up<00:00:53.470> to<00:00:53.680> 50<00:00:54.010> pounds<00:00:54.339> of<00:00:54.400> resistance

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
only goes up to 50 pounds of resistance

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.210 
only goes up to 50 pounds of resistance
you<00:00:55.180> want<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.080> incorporate<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.769> little<00:00:57.100> guy

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
rest time between hands that that's my

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.819 
rest time between hands that that's my
favorite<00:01:20.890> formula<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:22.390> mean<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:23.229> got<00:01:23.409> three

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
favorite formula I mean it's got three

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.469 
favorite formula I mean it's got three
different<00:01:23.859> colors<00:01:24.429> you<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.939> red<00:01:25.149> here

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
different colors you have the red here

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.950 
different colors you have the red here
which<00:01:26.079> is<00:01:26.229> 50<00:01:26.679> pounds<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:27.340> then<00:01:27.999> the<00:01:28.450> lightest

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
which is 50 pounds and then the lightest

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.419 
which is 50 pounds and then the lightest
being<00:01:29.350> 30<00:01:29.859> pounds<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:32.039> would<00:01:33.039> start<00:01:33.280> off

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
being 30 pounds really I would start off

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.130 
being 30 pounds really I would start off
with<00:01:33.609> the<00:01:33.700> 50<00:01:34.060> myself<00:01:34.509> but<00:01:34.810> that's<00:01:34.960> because

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
with the 50 myself but that's because

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.690 
with the 50 myself but that's because
you<00:01:35.439> gotta<00:01:35.619> work<00:01:35.859> it<00:01:35.950> out<00:01:36.039> for<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.280> while

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
you gotta work it out for a while

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.309 
you gotta work it out for a while
but<00:01:37.179> if<00:01:37.359> you've<00:01:37.479> never<00:01:37.659> done<00:01:37.899> any<00:01:38.109> type<00:01:38.289> of

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
but if you've never done any type of

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.109 
but if you've never done any type of
hand<00:01:38.619> grip<00:01:38.859> training<00:01:39.039> at<00:01:39.280> all<00:01:39.429> just<00:01:39.880> go<00:01:39.999> ahead

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
hand grip training at all just go ahead

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.590 
hand grip training at all just go ahead
and<00:01:40.569> buy<00:01:40.749> the<00:01:40.810> whole<00:01:41.229> 3<00:01:42.130> pack<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:43.329> can<00:01:43.359> work

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
and buy the whole 3 pack you can work

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.450 
and buy the whole 3 pack you can work
your<00:01:43.780> way<00:01:43.869> up<00:01:43.899> from<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.469> green<00:01:44.710> mean<00:01:45.100> thirty

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
your way up from the green mean thirty

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.959 
your way up from the green mean thirty
again<00:01:45.969> up<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:47.020> red<00:01:47.499> being<00:01:47.920> 50<00:01:48.399> it's

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
again up to the red being 50 it's

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.069 
again up to the red being 50 it's
probably<00:01:49.240> not<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.359> best<00:01:49.600> choice<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:49.990> can

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
probably not the best choice you can

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:50.309 
probably not the best choice you can
make

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
make

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.239 
make
I<00:01:51.630> believe<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.659> paid<00:01:52.899> maybe<00:01:53.109> like<00:01:53.259> 15<00:01:53.710> bucks<00:01:53.950> for

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249
