00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
say as I have not found in the official

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.230 
say as I have not found in the official
information<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.610> know<00:02:39.760> anything

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
information but if you know anything

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.730 
information but if you know anything
about<00:02:40.390> these<00:02:40.780> please<00:02:41.200> put<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.530> comments

about these please put in the comments
below<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.420> piece<00:02:43.780> line<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> think

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
below with the one piece line I think

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.960 
below with the one piece line I think
which<00:02:44.860> I'm<00:02:45.010> also<00:02:45.160> gonna<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> review<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
which I'm also gonna do a review in the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.940 
which I'm also gonna do a review in the
future<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.600> think<00:02:47.140> these<00:02:47.260> figures<00:02:47.620> were<00:02:47.710> banned

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
future I think these figures were banned

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.730 
future I think these figures were banned
due<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.310> lead<00:02:48.550> paint<00:02:48.820> poisoning<00:02:48.940> or<00:02:49.810> recalled

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
due to lead paint poisoning or recalled

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.160 
due to lead paint poisoning or recalled
