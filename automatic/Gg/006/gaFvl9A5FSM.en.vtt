00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.500
 a wonderful good day my 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.550
 ladies and gentlemen my name is trans 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.240
 guess and I drew a little round 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.379
 blow up watchblog 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 ok i thought i would take you too 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.170
 such a small city â€‹â€‹tour I have 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 that's not all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 so appraised and there I thought 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.880
 welcome 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:35.399
 gets in and ride awaits me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:38.660
 let's jump what alas I live here 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.860
 not haha yes I'm sorry beautiful 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 careful when you actually do it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.829
 stupid or something red green 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 You're welcome 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 careful old swede 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.399
 I think I'll take a look at it myself 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 will stand me now and 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 pretend I'm waiting for the bus and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 watch the crossing 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.840
 maybe I should be here 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.970
 but there are also negative ones 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.430
 things in wittstocks for example one 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.110
 slightly hakeligen control of the other 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.180
 has keyboard input then so 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.560
 a certain latency I can not handle 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.060
 to record the extorre I'm just taking 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.590
 with fraps so i hope that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.600
 my voice is reasonably audible and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.330
 so there are two more 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.890
 Three little updates are coming up now 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.810
 But I just want to random through 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.210
 drive the area 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.550
 of course, shit on the wrong side 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.640
 as it should be careful 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.500
 cockpit perspective so that's even 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.000
 a hat off situation so that is 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 really fat so I would like this 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 I like it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.390
 the music I have identified in the rest 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.280
 because of copyrights and so ne 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.110
 if me because youtube then adapt 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.369
 could or something 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.990
 rather make out is better for 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 you if you want to make gameplays 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 Remember that the music makes him 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.270
 not about gta 5 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.510
 better is like me that you have a content 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.880
 id strike gets who sees it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.560
 horny from the tunnel and this light 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 motion blur that is this time 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.670
 really not that extreme on anyone 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.660
 always quite cool from this constant 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.660
 stand at the traffic light 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:46.790
 I did not want me here either 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.790
 I'm a cow again 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.740
 I can not seem the way it looks 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.690
 say except traffic lights 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.280
 but that is because that the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.320
 mission has not yet played 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.540
 I guess you have to do it all this way 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.370
 Leveling is also on everyone 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.600
 very cool 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.390
 then you have at least something for what you want 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.370
 plays because I think that corners and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.930
 so he i believe as soon as it is like this 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.940
 there are drawbridges and so what you then 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.530
 can chop high or chop down 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.670
 Anyway that will be pretty 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.670
 pretty funny 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:31.299
 I did not want that but was close 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.299
 old Swede is the cool o 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.420
 but I was not here for that 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.659
 but also like to take my car 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.659
 bye 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.910
 Excuse me, I think that's not 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.390
 non-smoking public domain controller la 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.390
 la la la 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940
 but yes, I like that for everyone 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.070
 case 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.760
 I could call the police now 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.860
 I do not do my smartphone 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.860
 okay I'm in the car and so 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.470
 I have a short time in between 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.150
 the vehicle changed but I wanted 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.330
 you still very briefly just the map 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.130
 Show here and that is not even 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.620
 huge so that's probably times 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.660
 really openworld that's it 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 pretty fat down there is somehow 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.250
 water i wanted to like that 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.250
 watch water 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 That's why we were there now 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.230
 just go there 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.150
 a slight mountain chain then we go 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.229
 but sometimes in this trail along 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.370
 go above all things 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:05:00.060
 I'm standing here right now so yes 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:03.900
 shit is already a stop so the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.550
 water quality is also very beautiful as 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.949
 I just had to determine class 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.800
 Hello hello beauty 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.970
 I will drive you soon 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.330
 probably be broken but me 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.750
 I'll drive you first 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.750
 Gosh 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:28.360
 Boy is the crate from me lay 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.120
 place old Swede was shit and 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.160
 already scratch in it shit but that is 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.980
 also with the latency of the me 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.510
 said that if I press that the 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.190
 map right after who to 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.850
 example but that there is still one 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.810
 takes a bit but millisecond 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.770
 you have to be sure of that 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.070
 win makoto you have a clue 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:57.600
 what the card costs so close up often 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.600
 Steering wheel but stupid sow not to grasp 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.250
 human you know what I'm on 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.900
 So either the nights last 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.090
 here extremely long or there is none 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:13.100
 day and night change that would be that 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:16.270
 a criterion will be brighter now 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.950
 or not I do not know anymore 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.830
 no idea no idea no idea 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.690
 yes but I think so first as a whole 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.060
 A short insight into workshops is enough 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.200
 but completely out of the game is one 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.670
 bang I'll definitely 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.630
 quite a lot of gambling will happen 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.970
 many videos do not worry so me 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.120
 Now put me back to sleep and up 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.120
 then
