00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.410
 all 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.890
 its self prada sound also deserves 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.379
 citizen it is likely that at the bottom of the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.839
 mountainbike world avoiding another 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.839
 door beautiful rally taormina cannibal 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.300
 remember sylvain I'm mechanos of the team 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.720
 vlc rising bike racing team dont call 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.760
 it has prepared a nice little bottle 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.800
 precisely specific for use 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.440
 of the mike world in this sport it's clear 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 that runners the pilots need 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.790
 to focus first on the on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.340
 the way on the place and roll they 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.530
 have not they have to at least look 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 in fact where they will put their can 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 must be active enough 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 so we need a bogus door that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.840
 allow to leave the can very 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.369
 easily so laterally like that one 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 can put it back very easily 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 despite all the can remains well in place 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 because in mountain bike in handbike 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.340
 we have a lot of vibrations a lot of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.119
 shocks so it's very important that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.119
 the one of which we remain in place 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 the bianchi team raising fonts has 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 confirmed exceptional laboratory and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:35.700
