00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
but we are going to discuss the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.390 
but we are going to discuss the
placement<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:04.250> anterior<00:00:05.250> talk<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:07.080> main

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
placement of anterior talk and the main

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.220 
placement of anterior talk and the main
aspect<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.429> want<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.670> demonstrate<00:00:08.809> on<00:00:09.809> this

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
aspect I want to demonstrate on this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.589 
aspect I want to demonstrate on this
wire<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.759> please<00:00:12.030> talk<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
wire is that if you please talk and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.470 
wire is that if you please talk and
surely<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.290> don't<00:00:13.530> want<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.980> introduce

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
surely you don't want to introduce

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.660 
surely you don't want to introduce
unwanted<00:00:15.480> talk<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> buckle<00:00:16.470> segments<00:00:16.980> so

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
unwanted talk in the buckle segments so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.420 
unwanted talk in the buckle segments so
good<00:00:17.940> tip<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.949> what's<00:00:20.160> called<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
good tip is to do what's called a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
good tip is to do what's called a
goalpost<00:00:20.670> bend<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.930> end<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> wire<00:00:23.039> on

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
goalpost bend at the end of the wire on

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.429 
goalpost bend at the end of the wire on
both<00:00:23.609> sides<00:00:24.000> when<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> goalpost<00:00:24.960> bend

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
both sides when you do a goalpost bend

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.679 
both sides when you do a goalpost bend
or<00:00:25.560> 90<00:00:25.890> degree<00:00:26.250> bend<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> wire<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.570> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
or 90 degree bend on the wire you can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
or 90 degree bend on the wire you can
see<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.080> unwanted<00:00:28.500> talk<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> placed<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
see if unwanted talk is placed which is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
see if unwanted talk is placed which is
hard<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> visualize<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> wires<00:00:31.769> flat

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
hard to visualize that if the wires flat

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
hard to visualize that if the wires flat
so<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.090> put<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> goalpost<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.320> either

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
so I'm going to put a goalpost on either

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.360 
so I'm going to put a goalpost on either
side<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.550> wire<00:00:36.800> again<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.250> use

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
side of this wire again you can use

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
side of this wire again you can use
stainless<00:00:38.610> steel<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.140> beta

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stainless steel or you can use beta

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
stainless steel or you can use beta
titanium<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> prefer<00:00:41.460> beta<00:00:41.670> titanium<00:00:42.329> which<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
titanium I prefer beta titanium which is

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.770 
titanium I prefer beta titanium which is
easy<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> bend<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> wrong

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
easy to bend and if you do make a wrong

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.000 
easy to bend and if you do make a wrong
bend<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.350> take<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.860> without

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
bend you actually take it out without

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.690 
bend you actually take it out without
fracturing<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.420> wire<00:00:49.010> it's<00:00:50.010> much<00:00:50.219> less

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
fracturing the the wire it's much less

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850 
fracturing the the wire it's much less
pain<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> patient<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.590> put

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
pain for the patient because if you put

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
pain for the patient because if you put
talk<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.430> 20<00:00:53.820> degrees<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.149> stainless<00:00:54.750> steel

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
talk of 20 degrees on stainless steel

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
talk of 20 degrees on stainless steel
and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.739> try<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:55.980> place<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> bracket

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and then try and place it in a bracket

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
and then try and place it in a bracket
it<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> painful<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> close<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> gate

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it really is painful to close the gate

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
it really is painful to close the gate
of<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.859> bracket<00:00:59.129> whereas<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.820> has<00:00:59.879> some

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
of that bracket whereas this has some

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
of that bracket whereas this has some
give<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
give in it right so right now we have a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.600 
give in it right so right now we have a
wire<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> has<00:01:02.940> zero<00:01:03.530> talk<00:01:04.530> around<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> wire

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
wire that has zero talk around the wire

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.870 
wire that has zero talk around the wire
and<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.030> introducing<00:01:06.900> let's<00:01:07.140> say<00:01:07.409> 20<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> 20

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and I'm introducing let's say 20 to 20

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
and I'm introducing let's say 20 to 20
degrees<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.420> increased<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> upper

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
degrees of increased or so in the upper

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
degrees of increased or so in the upper
arch<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.000> might<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
arch I might use something like this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
arch I might use something like this
when<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.799> running<00:01:13.979> class<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.610> elastics<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
when I'm running class to elastics to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.320 
when I'm running class to elastics to
prevent<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> D<00:01:15.930> talking<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> incisors<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
prevent the D talking of the incisors I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
prevent the D talking of the incisors I
might<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> case<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.619> div<00:01:19.860> 2<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
might do this in a case that is div 2 to

I haven't expressed enough effective

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
I haven't expressed enough effective
talk<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> add<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.560> more

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
talk and I want to add a little bit more

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.870 
talk and I want to add a little bit more
in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.850> lower<00:01:27.210> arch<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.619> put<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> negative

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
in the lower arch I can put in negative

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780 
in the lower arch I can put in negative
talk<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> run<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.380> class<00:01:31.619> 2<00:01:31.890> elastics<00:01:32.400> stop

this mark is so that you know where to
start<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> take<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> talk<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> biggest

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
start and take out the talk the biggest

going<00:03:29.959> back<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.340> other<00:03:31.610> side<00:03:32.480> now

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
going back to the other side now

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.710 
going back to the other side now
remember<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.670> was<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.970> visualize<00:03:35.360> this

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
remember if I was to visualize this

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.220 
remember if I was to visualize this
I<00:03:35.750> have<00:03:35.959> zero<00:03:35.989> talk<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:38.120> area<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
I have zero talk in the area of the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.400 
I have zero talk in the area of the
lateral<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.770> now<00:03:40.100> have<00:03:40.780> 20<00:03:41.780> degrees<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.230> talk

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
lateral I now have 20 degrees of talk

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.910 
lateral I now have 20 degrees of talk
easier<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.660> side<00:03:44.930> I'm<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.769> have

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
easier so on this side I'm going to have

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.550 
easier so on this side I'm going to have
to<00:03:46.100> take<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.700> talk<00:03:46.940> out<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:48.140> take<00:03:48.350> the

lifting<00:04:03.080> up<00:04:03.470> we're<00:04:04.430> just<00:04:04.670> pushing<00:04:05.000> down<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
lifting up we're just pushing down the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.509 
lifting up we're just pushing down the
exact<00:04:05.900> same<00:04:06.080> amount<00:04:06.290> if<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.040> grip<00:04:07.280> that

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
exact same amount if you grip that

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.900 
exact same amount if you grip that
tightly<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.470> grip<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:09.709> then<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.760> can

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
tightly and you grip this then you can

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.670 
tightly and you grip this then you can
see<00:04:11.150> talk<00:04:11.660> being<00:04:11.959> removed<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.700> now<00:04:14.000> have

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
see talk being removed so you now have

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.740 
see talk being removed so you now have
zero<00:04:15.680> talk<00:04:16.010> twenty<00:04:16.760> degrees<00:04:17.000> right<00:04:17.209> back<00:04:17.510> to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
zero talk twenty degrees right back to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.890 
zero talk twenty degrees right back to
zero<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:19.280> check<00:04:19.580> if<00:04:19.820> it's<00:04:20.330> zero<00:04:20.630> talk

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
zero and you can check if it's zero talk

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.630 
zero and you can check if it's zero talk
by<00:04:21.049> looking<00:04:21.320> at<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.470> goalpost<00:04:22.010> if<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
by looking at that goalpost if that

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.219 
by looking at that goalpost if that
goalpost<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.300> leading<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:23.780> way<00:04:24.050> you're

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
goalpost was leading this way you're

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.879 
goalpost was leading this way you're
leaning<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.620> way<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:25.280> you

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
leaning that way if you

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.239 
leaning that way if you
should<00:04:26.069> use<00:04:26.249> unwanted<00:04:26.999> tool<00:04:27.620> again<00:04:28.620> every

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.249 
should use unwanted tool again every

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.700 
should use unwanted tool again every
time<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.490> bend<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:29.969> wire<00:04:30.180> please<00:04:31.080> go<00:04:31.469> back

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
time you bend the wire please go back

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.219 
time you bend the wire please go back
and<00:04:31.949> ensure<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.610> it's<00:04:33.120> flat<00:04:33.389> if<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.960> rocks

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
and ensure that it's flat if it rocks

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.080 
and ensure that it's flat if it rocks
like<00:04:34.499> that<00:04:34.710> you're<00:04:35.159> going<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.400> introduce<00:04:35.939> an

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
like that you're going to introduce an

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.209 
like that you're going to introduce an
unwanted<00:04:36.539> can't<00:04:36.870> into<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.319> equation<00:04:37.800> so

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
unwanted can't into the equation so

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.070 
unwanted can't into the equation so
place<00:04:38.669> y<00:04:38.939> flat<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.599> see<00:04:39.810> where<00:04:39.990> it's

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
place y flat you can see where it's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.200 
place y flat you can see where it's

riding up is normally where you've made

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.429 
riding up is normally where you've made
the<00:04:42.360> Ben<00:04:42.539> because<00:04:42.779> that's<00:04:42.960> obviously<00:04:43.110> what's

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
the Ben because that's obviously what's

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.489 
the Ben because that's obviously what's
caused<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.039> line<00:04:44.689> I'd<00:04:45.689> normally<00:04:45.960> place<00:04:46.319> to

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:46.499 
caused the line I'd normally place to

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.339 
caused the line I'd normally place to
talk<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:47.210> 1925<00:04:48.210> okay<00:04:48.689> so<00:04:48.749> for<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.080> purpose

tip I can share with doctors is make

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.429 
tip I can share with doctors is make
sure<00:05:23.699> you<00:05:23.879> cut<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.360> end<00:05:24.509> of<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.779> goalpost<00:05:25.229> off

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
sure you cut the end of the goalpost off

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.989 
sure you cut the end of the goalpost off
before<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:25.919> try<00:05:26.159> and<00:05:26.249> put<00:05:26.400> that<00:05:26.520> back<00:05:26.729> in<00:05:26.939> the

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
before you try and put that back in the

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:28.820 
before you try and put that back in the
mouth<00:05:27.180> where<00:05:27.419> you'll<00:05:27.569> find<00:05:27.749> it<00:05:27.960> had<00:05:28.589> a<00:05:28.620> couple

mouth where you'll find it had a couple
of<00:05:28.889> doctors<00:05:29.069> in<00:05:29.339> New<00:05:29.460> Zealand<00:05:30.889> having<00:05:31.889> great

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
of doctors in New Zealand having great

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.670 
of doctors in New Zealand having great
difficulty<00:05:32.729> with<00:05:33.150> no<00:05:33.300> placing<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> wire<00:05:34.110> in

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
difficulty with no placing the wire in

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.700 
difficulty with no placing the wire in
the<00:05:35.129> slide<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.669> so<00:05:36.089> the<00:05:36.210> big<00:05:36.389> tip<00:05:36.629> is<00:05:36.839> to<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.439> cut

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the slide so so the big tip is to to cut

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.999 
the slide so so the big tip is to to cut
the<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.490> wire<00:05:39.029> on<00:05:39.270> either<00:05:39.449> side<00:05:39.810> so<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.560> that
