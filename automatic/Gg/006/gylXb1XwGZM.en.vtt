I'm<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.480> good<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.809> soldering<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
I'm not really good in soldering so

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
I'm not really good in soldering so
while<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> tried<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.619> sure

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
while I tried you just want to make sure

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609
