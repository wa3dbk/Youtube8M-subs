00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460 

this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.750> our<00:00:00.870> cavitation<00:00:01.589> plate<00:00:03.110> you<00:00:04.110> can<00:00:04.290> see

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
this is our cavitation plate you can see

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.150 
this is our cavitation plate you can see
it's<00:00:04.589> just<00:00:04.799> slightly<00:00:05.100> bent<00:00:05.930> about<00:00:06.930> 3/8<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.040> an

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
it's just slightly bent about 3/8 of an

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.459 
it's just slightly bent about 3/8 of an
inch<00:00:08.250> maybe<00:00:08.519> half<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.059> inch<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.750> weld<00:00:10.170> on

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
inch maybe half an inch from the weld on

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.690 
inch maybe half an inch from the weld on
the<00:00:10.590> gusset<00:00:11.660> we<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.110> two<00:00:14.040> pieces<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> bar

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the gusset we just use two pieces of bar

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
the gusset we just use two pieces of bar
to<00:00:14.849> do<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.120 

we<00:00:42.670> also<00:00:42.820> use<00:00:43.290> something<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.559> kind<00:00:44.890> of<00:00:44.920> get<00:00:45.100> a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
we also use something to kind of get a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.950 
we also use something to kind of get a
reference<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.820> know<00:00:45.940> where<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.239> start<00:00:46.600> or

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
reference to know where to start or

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.270 
reference to know where to start or
where<00:00:47.770> we're<00:00:47.980> starting<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.600> we<00:00:49.690> can<00:00:50.280> know

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
where we're starting so that we can know

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:16.139 
where we're starting so that we can know
how<00:00:51.460> much<00:00:51.640> we<00:00:51.850> want<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.150> bend<00:00:52.329> it<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:15.820> getting

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
how much we want to bend it I'm getting

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.620 
how much we want to bend it I'm getting
these<00:01:16.410> two<00:01:17.410> pieces<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.890> quarter-inch<00:01:18.330> bar<00:01:19.330> on

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
these two pieces of quarter-inch bar on

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.139 
these two pieces of quarter-inch bar on
here<00:01:19.960> make<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.160> that<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:21.399> can<00:01:21.610> we<00:01:22.119> can

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
here make it so that we can we can

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.680 
here make it so that we can we can
concentrate<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.990> bend<00:01:23.320> at<00:01:23.530> one<00:01:23.710> point<00:01:24.690> okay

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
concentrate the bend at one point okay

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:36.420 
concentrate the bend at one point okay
so<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.289> where<00:01:26.440> we<00:01:26.590> are<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.100> then<00:01:36.250> we're

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
so you know where we are and then we're

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.240 
so you know where we are and then we're
just<00:01:36.460> using<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:37.590> crescent<00:01:38.590> wrench<00:01:38.649> on<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.100> end

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
just using a crescent wrench on the end

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.029 
just using a crescent wrench on the end
of<00:01:39.369> these<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.729> crank<00:01:40.000> on<00:01:40.179> it<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.920> have

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
of these to crank on it just have

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.920 
of these to crank on it just have
somebody<00:01:42.399> hold<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:46.350> shoot<00:01:47.350> oh<00:01:48.100> my<00:01:48.610> gosh

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
somebody hold really shoot oh my gosh

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.649 
somebody hold really shoot oh my gosh
yeah<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.229> probably<00:01:50.470> should<00:01:50.740> go<00:01:50.860> back<00:01:51.659> no

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
yeah we probably should go back no

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.370 
yeah we probably should go back no
really<00:01:53.500> that's<00:01:53.619> about<00:01:53.860> half<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.930> think

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
really that's about half is that I think

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.840 
really that's about half is that I think
we<00:01:56.500> started<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.040> where<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.310> was<00:01:57.400> good<00:01:57.670> before

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
we started it where it was good before

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.929 
we started it where it was good before
we<00:01:58.090> were<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.930> they<00:02:02.079> don't<00:02:02.200> anymore

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.429 

they<00:02:05.939> did<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.110> car<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> was

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they did that's to my car it was

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
they did that's to my car it was
insurance<00:02:08.160> positive<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.940> cannot<00:02:09.270> feel<00:02:09.599> how

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
insurance positive I cannot feel how

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:27.380 
insurance positive I cannot feel how
much<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.170> bending<00:02:10.410> right<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:27.180> bends

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
much it's bending right there it bends

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.910 
much it's bending right there it bends
really<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.530> easy<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.040> too<00:02:29.099> far

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
really easy so it's easy to go too far

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.900 
really easy so it's easy to go too far
that's<00:02:31.920> part<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.280> why<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.519> use<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> reference

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that's part of why we use a reference

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.090 
that's part of why we use a reference
and<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.920> angle<00:02:38.459> should<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:39.080> good<00:02:40.100> for

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
and so now that angle should be good for

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.759 
and so now that angle should be good for
now<00:02:41.250> anyway<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.870> keep<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.440> under<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
now anyway to keep it just under the

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.449 
now anyway to keep it just under the
water<00:02:45.410> we're<00:02:46.410> gonna<00:02:46.470> go<00:02:46.709> test<00:02:46.950> run<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.310> right

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
water we're gonna go test run it right

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.640 
water we're gonna go test run it right
now
