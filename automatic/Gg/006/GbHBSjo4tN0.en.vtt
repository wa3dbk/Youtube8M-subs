00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
clean this is insulation it's going to

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.040 
clean this is insulation it's going to
be<00:00:28.840> used<00:00:29.050> for<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:31.650> bit<00:00:32.650> all<00:00:32.800> over<00:00:32.830> actually<00:00:35.220> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.300 

there's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> cracking<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> doors

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.210 

a<00:01:01.370> little<00:01:02.000> bit<00:01:02.150> here<00:01:02.540> on<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.080> ceiling<00:01:03.680> but<00:01:03.950> I

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
a little bit here on the ceiling but I

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.910 
a little bit here on the ceiling but I
can't<00:01:04.880> really<00:01:05.120> see<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.630> video<00:01:05.920> there's

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
can't really see in the video there's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.600 
can't really see in the video there's
probably<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.460> pre-existing<00:01:08.090> crack<00:01:09.610> that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
probably a pre-existing crack that

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.770 
probably a pre-existing crack that
opened<00:01:11.060> up

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.609 

as<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.080> rest<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.500> house<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:23.470> why

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
as to the rest of the house that's why

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.190 
as to the rest of the house that's why
my<00:01:23.979> chimney<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:25.119> can't<00:01:25.330> see<00:01:25.540> anything<00:01:25.780> can

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
my chimney you can't see anything can

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.039 
my chimney you can't see anything can
you<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.970> when<00:01:28.119> we<00:01:28.270> chimney<00:01:28.630> went<00:01:28.810> through

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
you because when we chimney went through

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.160 
you because when we chimney went through
they<00:01:29.229> have<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.530> patch<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.040> up<00:01:33.899> better<00:01:34.899> we

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
they have to patch that up better we

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.899 
they have to patch that up better we
