00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.650
 a cake pops of the cookie-eating monster 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 and it's like that 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:36.800
 and it 's super super easy to do 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.170
 and well I hope and they like it and like it 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.170
 The material we are going to use is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.540
 our cold porcelain you already know that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.370
 can use cold porcelain or asia 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.000
 for america 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 I'm going to use cold porcelain in 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.949
 navy blue 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.789
 and for the cookie we're going to use the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.789
 coffee color in two coffees is and white 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.660
 We are going to use 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.260
 a toothpick 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.220
 let's use a toothbrush 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.970
 recommendable 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 what it has in the part of here has like 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.210
 little dots that can give you texture and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.470
 and this gives you texture and in the good in the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 part here is the texture too 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.690
 we will use 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.660
 aluminum foil 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.380
 and a down and a record 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.400
 to make our type of monster 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.400
 comegalletas come on 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.920
 flush 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 a first let's make the cookie 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.250
 let's stop our 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.250
 polymer clay 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.819
 a little bit nothing else that is going to be 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.819
 our cookie 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.010
 and we're going to put it this way 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 and we will give texture 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.080
 in this way 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.349
 since it has the texture 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.280
 let's go like this let's give our other 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.280
 bit of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.689
 cold porcelain that is the most coffee 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.750
 bigger and it 's good more forgiveness with 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.680
 color plus coffee 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.680
 and let's go 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.340
 put your dots of what is the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340
 cookie 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.170
 and here's how we're going to get it out 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.520
 Leaving aside the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.130
 and we are going to wait for aluminum foil 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 and our color 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.859
 blue 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.670
 and we will keep 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:56.340
 and we are going to do 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 the little ball that I have in this 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.280
 let's make a little ball 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.550
 the size that we want our cake 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.550
 pops 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.780
 sorry and you 're going to want the size 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.540
 What explains your ballot will be 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.540
 size you're going to pop them 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.600
 then now let's go giving it texture 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.000
 and we're going to pass it smoothly through 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.870
 aluminum foil that should be 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.870
 wrinkled 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.430
 for the aluminum foil they make little ball and 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.139
 then they unwrap it and they're going to 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:51.199
 stay like that to give them texture now 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:51.199
 let's open the part here as well 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.300
 in this way 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.980
 our student stick if you want what 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.140
 you can paint from 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.140
 white if not 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.390
 Y 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.819
 let's 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.130
 and put it on the inside what 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.479
 let's leave there but for that we're going 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.479
 to add transit 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 resistol 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.430
 so that libya 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.780
 and so we do not fit 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.060
 since it is like this 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.670
 we go 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.580
 add also resistol to the cookie 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.580
 and fitting 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.350
 in the strong here 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.040
 A) Yes 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.480
 now 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:37.420
 let's see our 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.420
 our porcelain is blank 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.920
 and we are going to make two balls 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.540
 A) Yes 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.170
 Y 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.990
 and that we're going to paste in the part here 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.960
 let's add him to the recital 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.879
 ellis 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.650
 now practically it is already 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:28.380
 finished 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.790
 if you want to paint her eyes of a 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.050
 time 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.050
 you can paint them 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.580
 and there it is 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.580
 our cake pops 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.529
