00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
it's not that high obviously and so I

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's not that high obviously and so I
did<00:02:28.180> concentrate<00:02:28.810> more<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.019> my<00:02:29.170> ends<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.769> mass

weeks ago and I haven't really got risk
with<00:03:51.940> three<00:03:52.090> per<00:03:52.269> se<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.680> um<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:55.359> can<00:03:55.510> see

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
with three per se but um you can see

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.939 
with three per se but um you can see
there<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:55.989> little<00:03:56.319> bit<00:03:56.410> darker<00:03:56.799> there

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
there is a little bit darker there

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.129 
there is a little bit darker there
that's<00:03:57.220> not<00:03:57.459> roots<00:03:57.760> or<00:03:57.940> anything<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.540> don't

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
that's not roots or anything I don't

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.750 
that's not roots or anything I don't
know<00:03:59.199> why<00:03:59.349> it's<00:03:59.530> gonna<00:03:59.680> bit<00:03:59.889> dark<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.370> her<00:04:00.519> mom

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
know why it's gonna bit dark and her mom

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.199 
know why it's gonna bit dark and her mom
when<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.359> roots<00:04:01.840> should<00:04:02.470> be<00:04:02.680> but<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.099> has<00:04:03.280> but

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
when I roots should be but it has but

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.210 
when I roots should be but it has but
and<00:04:04.449> I<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:05.139> if<00:04:05.290> anyone<00:04:05.620> was<00:04:05.709> considering

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
and I think if anyone was considering

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.909 
and I think if anyone was considering
doing<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.579> maybe<00:04:07.139> think<00:04:08.139> about<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.560> lot<00:04:08.739> longer

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
doing it maybe think about it lot longer

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.550 
doing it maybe think about it lot longer
than<00:04:09.099> addicts<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.669> literally<00:04:10.510> took<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.230> day<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
than addicts I literally took a day to

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.039 
than addicts I literally took a day to
think<00:04:11.769> about<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> think<00:04:13.599> maybe<00:04:13.810> I'd

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
think about it so I think maybe I'd

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.310 
think about it so I think maybe I'd
recommend<00:04:15.120> taking<00:04:16.120> more<00:04:16.419> time<00:04:16.449> not<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.169> think

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
recommend taking more time not to think

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.580 
recommend taking more time not to think
about<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:17.889> yeah<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:19.169> plan<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.199> think<00:04:20.470> of

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
about it but yeah and plan to think of

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.140 
about it but yeah and plan to think of
things<00:04:20.889> they<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.489> already<00:04:21.640> changed<00:04:21.909> my

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
probably a little more blush to try and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.860 
probably a little more blush to try and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.160 
give myself a little more color to my
cheeks<00:04:53.110> but<00:04:53.950> as<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.250> see<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.490> am

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
cheeks but as you can see I am

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.880 
cheeks but as you can see I am
ridiculously<00:04:56.170> pale<00:04:56.500> naturally<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> when<00:04:58.300> I

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
ridiculously pale naturally so I when I

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.470 
ridiculously pale naturally so I when I
think<00:04:59.890> it<00:05:00.040> probably<00:05:00.070> makes<00:05:00.790> me<00:05:01.120> look<00:05:01.240> less

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480
