00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
so what we were discussing

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.600 
so what we were discussing
the<00:01:44.680> issues<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.159> actually<00:01:45.670> surround

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the issues that actually surround

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.740 
the issues that actually surround
really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 

there's<00:01:52.290> always<00:01:52.440> been<00:01:52.710> fairly<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.400> be<00:01:53.490> get

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
there's always been fairly it can be get

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
there's always been fairly it can be get
started<00:01:54.030> officially<00:01:54.299> never<00:01:54.720> gonna<00:01:54.900> get<00:01:55.049> back

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
started officially never gonna get back

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
started officially never gonna get back
there<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.180> fact<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.659> mind

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there is always in fact in your mind

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.100 
there is always in fact in your mind
which<00:01:58.080> almost<00:01:58.380> stops<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> fear

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
which almost stops with the fear

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
which almost stops with the fear
so<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.130> deal<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> limiting

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so we deal with what is limiting

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
so we deal with what is limiting
decision<00:02:04.880> but<00:02:05.880> also<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> point

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
decision but also to point

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.940 

with<00:02:09.150> the<00:02:09.270> steps<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.020> take<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.560> stop

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
with the steps that you can take to stop

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.730 
with the steps that you can take to stop
so<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.880> mixture<00:02:13.500> practical<00:02:14.500> stuff

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
so it's like a mixture practical stuff

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:30.869 
so it's like a mixture practical stuff
that<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.099> could<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.819> plus<00:02:16.150> therapeutics

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.599 

it<00:02:31.879> is<00:02:32.000> nothing<00:02:32.959> when<00:02:33.109> I<00:02:33.140> did<00:02:33.349> them<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.709> see<00:02:33.890> I

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
it is nothing when I did them to see I

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.880 
it is nothing when I did them to see I
think<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.359> die<00:02:35.599> attitude<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.260> about<00:02:36.439> six<00:02:36.769> or

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
think we die attitude to about six or

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.710 
think we die attitude to about six or
seven<00:02:37.129> through<00:02:37.280> diamonds<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.420> could<00:02:38.569> only

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
seven through diamonds and I could only

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.559 
seven through diamonds and I could only
this<00:02:39.079> this<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.769> or<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> build<00:02:41.209> a

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
this this this this or this and build a

this this this this or this and build a
four<00:02:41.900> billion<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.590> point<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.299> promotion

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
four billion to the point of promotion

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.420 
four billion to the point of promotion
to<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.659> certain<00:02:45.079> fears<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.099> know<00:02:46.250> we

to all certain fears you know we

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.129 
to all certain fears you know we
discussed<00:02:46.849> how<00:02:47.120> do<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.359> get<00:02:47.510> past<00:02:47.689> this<00:02:47.870> point

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
discussed how do we get past this point

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.910 
discussed how do we get past this point
and<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:48.500> wasn't<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> much<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.650> foods

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.960 
himself he would go into a situation
where<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.709> don't<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.250> been<00:02:55.430> known<00:02:55.609> for<00:02:55.819> being

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
where I don't have been known for being

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.800 
where I don't have been known for being
me<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.629> then<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.349> couldn't<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.799> really<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:59.299> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
me and then I couldn't not really so I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.259 
me and then I couldn't not really so I
couldn't<00:03:00.500> then<00:03:00.709> get<00:03:00.889> fat<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:01.909> we<00:03:02.030> had<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
couldn't then get fat and so we had to

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.140 
couldn't then get fat and so we had to
adjust<00:03:02.530> very<00:03:03.530> precise<00:03:03.980> shape<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.819> know<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
adjust very precise shape you know and I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.520 
adjust very precise shape you know and I
was<00:03:05.299> getting<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.959> point<00:03:06.049> where<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.379> was

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
was getting to the point where I was

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.640 
was getting to the point where I was
almost<00:03:06.680> borderline<00:03:07.220> anorexic<00:03:08.209> no<00:03:09.169> problem

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
almost borderline anorexic no problem

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.199 
almost borderline anorexic no problem
yeah

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.229 

thing<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.409> that<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.769> fear<00:03:14.129> it's<00:03:14.790> ultimately

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
thing is that it's fear it's ultimately

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.220 
thing is that it's fear it's ultimately
thinner<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:17.459> almost<00:03:17.909> indescribable<00:03:18.390> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
thinner it's almost indescribable to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.289 
thinner it's almost indescribable to
explain<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> someone<00:03:19.950> what<00:03:20.280> what<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.939> fear

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
state I think throughout six months

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.870 
state I think throughout six months
together<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.710> think<00:04:01.070> people<00:04:01.370> are<00:04:01.430> gonna<00:04:01.610> see<00:04:01.850> a

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
together I think people are gonna see a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.110 
together I think people are gonna see a
different<00:04:02.120> side<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.600> me<00:04:02.870> that's<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:04.040> lot<00:04:04.580> for<00:04:04.610> a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
different side to me that's a lot for a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.360 
different side to me that's a lot for a
lot<00:04:05.240> more<00:04:05.390> complete<00:04:05.840> than<00:04:06.080> there<00:04:06.380> was<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:07.130> I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
lot more complete than there was that I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.510 
lot more complete than there was that I
will<00:04:07.610> say<00:04:07.760> I've<00:04:07.970> eaten<00:04:09.310> consistently<00:04:10.310> about

take all the credit but the main thing I
think<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.780> main<00:04:33.260> thing<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:34.030> rather<00:04:35.030> than<00:04:35.330> what

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
think the main thing is rather than what

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.620 
think the main thing is rather than what
with<00:04:36.870> eating<00:04:37.200> disorders<00:04:37.740> such<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.730> you

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
fear of not being able to yet so I could

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.060 
fear of not being able to yet so I could
say<00:04:57.660> when<00:04:57.840> we<00:04:57.930> first<00:04:57.960> got<00:04:58.470> together<00:04:58.650> probably

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
say when we first got together probably

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.490 
say when we first got together probably
about<00:04:59.280> six<00:04:59.580> or<00:04:59.700> seven<00:04:59.910> foods<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.600> now<00:05:00.960> program
