on a master plan to look at the 11 acres

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
on a master plan to look at the 11 acres
and<00:01:20.729> how<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:22.100> initially

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and how we could use it initially

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880 
and how we could use it initially
started<00:01:23.159> looking<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.650> sanctuary<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
started looking at a sanctuary and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
started looking at a sanctuary and
looked<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.430> planning<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
looked at planning for that but as we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
looked at planning for that but as we
talked<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.400> realized

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
talked with them I think they realized

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
talked with them I think they realized
that<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> needs<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> youth<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.740> were

to<00:02:49.210> dozens<00:02:50.210> of<00:02:50.360> churches<00:02:50.540> they've<00:02:51.020> called

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
to dozens of churches they've called

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.950 
to dozens of churches they've called
called<00:02:52.280> us<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.640> asked<00:02:52.910> who<00:02:53.030> designed<00:02:53.780> or

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
called us and asked who designed or

built and built our church the single

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.530 
built and built our church the single
most<00:02:57.920> reason<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.820> they've<00:02:59.300> always

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
most reason is that they've always

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.060 
most reason is that they've always
produce<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.230> they<00:03:00.350> say<00:03:00.650> they're<00:03:00.830> going<00:03:00.980> to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
produce what they say they're going to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.400 
produce what they say they're going to
produce<00:03:01.390> when<00:03:02.390> things<00:03:02.690> when<00:03:02.900> others<00:03:03.170> said

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
produce when things when others said

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.900 
produce when things when others said
that<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.800> impossible<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.400> build<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that it was impossible to build on the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.060 
that it was impossible to build on the
site<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:05.420> said<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.870> possible<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.560> they

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
site they said it is possible and they

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.030 
site they said it is possible and they
did<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.820> they<00:03:07.940> produced<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.600> product<00:03:09.320> that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
did it and they produced a product that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.950 
did it and they produced a product that
I<00:03:10.070> think<00:03:10.400> anyone<00:03:10.700> who<00:03:10.820> passes<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.390> property

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
is just it's just a building when it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.550 
is just it's just a building when it
comes<00:03:25.340> down<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.880> what's<00:03:26.690> inside<00:03:27.080> though<00:03:27.410> is

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
comes down to it what's inside though is

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.470 
comes down to it what's inside though is
to<00:03:27.709> church<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.160> body<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.610> people<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.300> the
