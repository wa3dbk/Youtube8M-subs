there's<00:00:10.220> lots<00:00:10.550> of<00:00:10.700> different<00:00:10.850> considerations

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
there's lots of different considerations

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.910 
there's lots of different considerations
say<00:00:12.680> on<00:00:12.920> your<00:00:13.100> your<00:00:13.969> large<00:00:14.210> spessart<00:00:14.780> een<00:00:15.020> you

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
say on your your large spessart een you

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.460 
say on your your large spessart een you
almost<00:00:16.550> don't<00:00:17.090> worry<00:00:17.480> about<00:00:17.810> inclusions

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
almost don't worry about inclusions

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.410 
almost don't worry about inclusions
except<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:19.039> some<00:00:19.250> of<00:00:19.369> them<00:00:19.490> are<00:00:19.550> really<00:00:20.210> big

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
except that some of them are really big

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.350 
except that some of them are really big
and<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:21.590> have<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:21.980> worry<00:00:22.130> about<00:00:22.280> those<00:00:22.670> like

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
and you have to worry about those like

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.779 
and you have to worry about those like
the<00:00:23.509> ones<00:00:23.689> that<00:00:23.810> are<00:00:24.189> affect<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.310> structure

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
the ones that are affect the structure

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.189 
the ones that are affect the structure
of<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.970> stone<00:00:26.179> say<00:00:26.509> right<00:00:26.689> here<00:00:26.929> there's<00:00:27.140> a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
of the stone say right here there's a

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.400 
of the stone say right here there's a
big<00:00:27.679> flaw<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.310> crack<00:00:28.759> in<00:00:29.029> there<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:30.199> wouldn't

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
big flaw a crack in there you wouldn't

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.630 
big flaw a crack in there you wouldn't
be<00:00:30.500> able<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.679> leave<00:00:30.919> that<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.310> you'd<00:00:31.429> have<00:00:31.580> to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
be able to leave that and you'd have to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.520 
be able to leave that and you'd have to
cut<00:00:31.939> around<00:00:32.060> that<00:00:32.450> but<00:00:32.689> all<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.050> little<00:00:33.320> tiny

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
cut around that but all the little tiny

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.700 
cut around that but all the little tiny
dots<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.310> spots<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:35.000> there<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.450> can<00:00:35.690> cut<00:00:35.960> so

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
dots and spots in there you can cut so

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.069 
dots and spots in there you can cut so
you<00:00:36.740> have<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.250> make<00:00:38.030> decisions<00:00:38.660> about<00:00:38.780> what

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
you have to make decisions about what

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.810 
you have to make decisions about what
stays<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.560> what<00:00:39.800> doesn't<00:00:40.220> you<00:00:40.400> can<00:00:40.580> end<00:00:40.730> up

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
stays in what doesn't you can end up

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.730 
stays in what doesn't you can end up
with<00:00:40.880> your<00:00:41.180> black<00:00:41.420> spots<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.960> polish<00:00:42.320> stuck<00:00:42.590> in

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
with your black spots of polish stuck in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.000 
with your black spots of polish stuck in
holes<00:00:43.520> if<00:00:43.790> some<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.090> them<00:00:44.210> reach<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.600> surface

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
holes if some of them reach the surface

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.620 
holes if some of them reach the surface
but<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.220> general<00:00:46.670> you're<00:00:46.910> looking<00:00:47.240> more<00:00:47.420> for

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
but in general you're looking more for

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.210 
but in general you're looking more for
color<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.200> shape<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:49.100> these<00:00:49.430> garnets

color and shape on these garnets

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.500 
color and shape on these garnets
specifically<00:00:52.220> these<00:00:52.430> lowly<00:00:52.850> ondol<00:00:53.300> ones

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
specifically these lowly ondol ones

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.170 
specifically these lowly ondol ones
there's<00:00:53.930> some<00:00:54.140> crystal<00:00:55.040> surfaces<00:00:55.610> left<00:00:55.880> over

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
there's some crystal surfaces left over

there's some crystal surfaces left over
from<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.540> broken<00:00:56.750> trunk<00:00:57.170> these<00:00:58.160> are<00:00:58.310> some

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
from the broken trunk these are some

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.510 
from the broken trunk these are some
massive<00:00:58.730> crystals<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.920> some<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.280> them<00:01:01.400> are

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
massive crystals and some of them are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.250 
massive crystals and some of them are
better<00:01:01.730> off<00:01:01.940> carving<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.050> take

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
better off carving because then you take

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.530 
better off carving because then you take
out<00:01:03.410> all<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.710> big<00:01:03.920> nasty<00:01:04.430> ugly<00:01:04.850> spots<00:01:05.299> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
out all the big nasty ugly spots and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.820 
out all the big nasty ugly spots and
you've<00:01:05.630> got<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.810> very<00:01:05.990> attractive<00:01:06.170> looking

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
you've got a very attractive looking

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.890 
you've got a very attractive looking
stone<00:01:07.100> left<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.210> glow<00:01:08.479> from<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:08.780> inside

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
stone left the glow from the inside

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.370 
stone left the glow from the inside
after<00:01:09.500> these<00:01:09.770> are<00:01:09.890> polishes<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:11.200> think<00:01:12.200> very

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
after these are polishes I think very

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.570 
after these are polishes I think very
warming<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:14.140> convincing<00:01:15.140> material<00:01:15.680> these

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
warming and convincing material these

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.390 
warming and convincing material these
little<00:01:17.060> spacer<00:01:17.450> team<00:01:17.720> as<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.560> said<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.070> have<00:01:19.250> to

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
little spacer team as I said you have to

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.970 
little spacer team as I said you have to
work<00:01:19.580> around<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.530> inclusions<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.740> little

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
work around the inclusions the little

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.280 
work around the inclusions the little
white<00:01:22.160> dots<00:01:22.430> seen<00:01:23.300> they're<00:01:23.510> usually<00:01:23.690> right<00:01:24.080> in

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
white dots seen they're usually right in

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.320 
white dots seen they're usually right in
the<00:01:24.440> middle<00:01:24.620> so<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:25.040> cut<00:01:25.430> through<00:01:25.640> those<00:01:25.909> or

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
the middle so you cut through those or

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.720 
the middle so you cut through those or
make<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.260> decision<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.860> leave<00:01:28.040> them<00:01:28.190> in<00:01:28.310> and

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
make the decision to leave them in and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.520 
make the decision to leave them in and
the<00:01:28.820> color<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.120> intense<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.900> some<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.320> them<00:01:30.409> you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the color is intense on some of them you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.200 
the color is intense on some of them you
might<00:01:30.650> leave<00:01:30.860> them<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.159> but<00:01:31.400> really<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.850> value

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
might leave them in but really the value

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.050 
might leave them in but really the value
is<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.630> cleaner<00:01:33.020> stone<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.700> bright

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
is in the cleaner stone with a bright

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.940 
is in the cleaner stone with a bright
clean<00:01:35.390> reflection<00:01:36.050> that's<00:01:36.260> one<00:01:36.440> reason<00:01:36.620> many

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
clean reflection that's one reason many

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.530 
clean reflection that's one reason many
of<00:01:37.040> these<00:01:37.159> haven't<00:01:37.430> been<00:01:37.580> cut<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.120> they<00:01:38.360> have

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
of these haven't been cut is they have

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.560 
of these haven't been cut is they have
an<00:01:38.659> inclusion<00:01:39.140> right<00:01:39.409> in<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.830> middle<00:01:40.040> and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
an inclusion right in the middle and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.850 
an inclusion right in the middle and
that<00:01:41.570> really<00:01:41.750> needs<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.110> be<00:01:42.200> worked<00:01:42.320> around

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that really needs to be worked around

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.700 
that really needs to be worked around
the<00:01:43.550> Molly<00:01:43.790> garnets<00:01:44.330> are<00:01:44.510> like<00:01:44.690> nodules<00:01:45.320> these

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the Molly garnets are like nodules these

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.090 
the Molly garnets are like nodules these
are<00:01:45.860> obviously<00:01:46.250> an<00:01:46.460> alluvial<00:01:47.320> location<00:01:48.320> these

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
are obviously an alluvial location these

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.469 
are obviously an alluvial location these
are<00:01:49.310> probably<00:01:49.580> going<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.850> give<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.090> your<00:01:50.240> best

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
are probably going to give you your best

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
are probably going to give you your best
yield<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.049> just<00:01:51.260> drop<00:01:51.530> those<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:52.040> wherever

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
yield you just drop those up wherever

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.250 
yield you just drop those up wherever
you<00:01:52.640> find<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.970> flat<00:01:53.210> spot<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.720> cut<00:01:54.020> them<00:01:54.170> out

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
you find a flat spot and cut them out

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.770 
you find a flat spot and cut them out
they're<00:01:54.860> practically<00:01:55.580> preforms<00:01:56.150> for<00:01:56.360> rounds

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
they're practically preforms for rounds

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.990 
they're practically preforms for rounds
and<00:01:57.680> they<00:01:57.830> Sparkle<00:01:58.280> all<00:01:58.340> day<00:01:58.520> long<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> road

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and they Sparkle all day long the road

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.780 
and they Sparkle all day long the road
lights<00:01:59.299> are<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.600> exact<00:01:59.870> same<00:02:00.110> way<00:02:00.790> they're

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
lights are the exact same way they're

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.200 
lights are the exact same way they're
practically<00:02:02.450> flawless<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.700> orient<00:02:05.090> it

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
practically flawless you just orient it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.000 
practically flawless you just orient it
for<00:02:05.390> shape<00:02:05.659> there's<00:02:05.990> no<00:02:06.200> consideration<00:02:06.799> for

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
for shape there's no consideration for

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.919 
for shape there's no consideration for
color<00:02:07.400> since<00:02:07.790> they're<00:02:07.970> isotropic<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.720> color

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
color since they're isotropic the color

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.380 
color since they're isotropic the color
is<00:02:09.080> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.409> the<00:02:09.560> same<00:02:09.799> in<00:02:09.979> any<00:02:10.099> direction

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
is going to be the same in any direction

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.910 
is going to be the same in any direction
so<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> road<00:02:11.720> lights<00:02:11.959> are<00:02:12.110> very<00:02:12.349> fun<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.739> cut

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
so the road lights are very fun to cut

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.649 
so the road lights are very fun to cut
as<00:02:13.099> well<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.489> Molly<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:14.269> don't<00:02:14.299> have<00:02:14.540> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
worry about inclusions same with these

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.089

these<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.629> my<00:02:24.050> choice<00:02:24.319> would<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:25.000> color
