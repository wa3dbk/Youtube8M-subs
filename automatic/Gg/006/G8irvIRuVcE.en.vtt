00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
me it's always easier to play that was
because<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.370> enjoyed<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.970> much<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.390> do

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
because I enjoyed so much to do

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.949

sometimes<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.200> more<00:02:27.580> difficult<00:02:28.580> alone<00:02:29.480> in

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
sometimes it's more difficult alone in

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
sometimes it's more difficult alone in
the<00:02:30.050> singles<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.100> no<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.430> to

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the singles because you have no one to

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.990 
the singles because you have no one to
talk<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.780> share<00:02:32.989> your<00:02:33.170> feelings<00:02:37.000> but

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
talk to and to share your feelings but

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.030 
talk to and to share your feelings but
they're<00:02:38.270> always<00:02:38.600> wanted<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> go<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.380> zoo<00:02:39.800> to
