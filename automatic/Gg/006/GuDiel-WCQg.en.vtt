00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.180
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.970
 flash virtus.pro today wanted you 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.150
 show fight because of discharge when you 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.230
 have time to think only the spinal cord 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.450
 of course I want to think of course 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 brain a but the situation 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.689
 takes place so fast that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.480
 only have time to think back 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 respectively do and sometimes you too 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.650
 will need to apply it will need to be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.579
 do this 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 what is it but for a start we will come to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 the situation that I formed on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.650
 map to all of you familiar and who does not know 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.630
 this is a map of fjords getting to the center 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.000
 now almost nobody goes to 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.710
 center ever since the fourth and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 fifth line and on line bc formed 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.520
 the main routes that is before all 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.890
 have or tried to center 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.290
 shoot out ever since all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 it went not quite smoothly but I still 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.420
 keep in the center because of these bushes 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 you can skylight just I looked there 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 saw no one can see what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 whether someone is driving or not and what comes from 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.020
 6 not slowing starts 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 turn left considering we're in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 top 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 if we are together with the sixth you roll 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.190
 on virtually any opponent if he 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.620
 there will be one we will take it very quickly and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.040
 we see on the left apt-13 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.820
 and what are we doing hello in 13 come on 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.770
 be friends doublet shots continue 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.430
 shorten the distance flies in me 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.530
 furiously 326 still su-101 get under vvt 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 and decide it's time for me to snuggle up 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.400
 the left side here you can act 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.820
 as follows i have very strong 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.440
 the tower is really strong tower at the 112th 190 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.580
 can withstand a lot in this tower 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.820
 and you will see it again and again but at the same time 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 look at the center there is su-100 20 152 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.340
 t69 kvass and all sushist and they are 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.709
 on the right I still shorten the distance 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.379
 to the nearest against that seen here 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.090
 same t-34 is sent right so not coming 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.090
 all this 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 260 kg flies right and left me 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.300
 190 hp remains and I very quickly merged 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.040
 su-152 but you can not shoot back 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.290
 so fast and needed a little bit 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.440
 aim and aim him better 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.110
 the top part try to cure yes to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.269
 this time everything turns out I look all there 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 same to the cartoon trying su-152 me 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.049
 it would be better to pierce you dear to me 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 shot a landmine how a landmine would you 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.670
 I was clearly killed 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950
 but cumulative saves me all the same gold 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.319
 decides what is called and golda decides 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.329
 my favor flies mt-25 I can not 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.579
 in any case let him himself behind 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.060
 trying to rule on a piece of paper without damage and 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.940
 Jagdtigr 88 I save to the left there is still 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.170
 opponents and main opponent t69 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.629
 the drummer we destroy it below t32 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.090
 A-20 is also well 20 is unpleasant but better 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.180
 its just not letting anyone in the back that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.160
 I do the same I decide that the lady I shots 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.540
 that and the creature which stands there far 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.250
 and as you see it burns we wait for him 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.109
 not only is the damage great we hit 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.209
 gas tank is almost bad for him 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.340
 burn out a little bit he remains kp 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.870
 but in the meantime cumulative projectile 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.019
 20 rather armored-piercing 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.720
 punch me 20 i decide well damn well 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.579
 fourth level but Hamit is an infection that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.380
 same to do with this guy but once he 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.450
 switched to subscaliber worth it 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.910
 aiming nowhere especially not waiting for 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.430
 where he moves 20 he principle small 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.500
 he cannot stand under damage therefore 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.819
 either right or left or with one 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.700
 sides of the house or on the other 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.889
 kicked back catch it send 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.230
 Hangar of 6 squared b 6 destroy that 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.750
 we happened at all militant 10:06 in 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.329
 our favor but if you look at mine 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.290
 hobby dynamo and generally in principle 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:09.109
 health status no me ammo 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.650
 133 HYIP I left at 169 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:16.039
 half fp of 6 is not so much too 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.930
 hop there is still apt-13 yaga 88 panther and what 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.090
 we will do we will be friends 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.960
 seize the base despite the fact that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.420
 the enemy is no far from 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.190
 this very capture 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.500
 we will capture that is two stand 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.150
 on capture it's from 6 it's 69 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500
 I 'll just be through my tower 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440
 distract the boys themselves 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.900
 I rolled forward lit up and now 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.260
 just letting you know that in the beginning you will 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.390
 shoot me t29 and t29 decide not 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.400
 ignore me and shoots me 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.620
 scaly of course in mask me 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.450
 punching is very hard despite the fact that 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.640
 breaking through if he has a tobago start 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.150
 big enough anyway punch 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.880
 heavy 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.190
 armor-piercing subcaliber failed q2 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.350
 were riding it by the way unpleasant to them not 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.240
 avoided getting into the landmine 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.340
 have he apparently tried very 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.320
 I strongly target due to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.320
 moving back and forth all the same its 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.720
 swung not again not punch me t29 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.120
 it's already 11 shots me seven seconds u 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.520
 we remain until the capture of the base and yet 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.850
 armor-piercing conventional armor-piercing projectile 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 me 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.270
 T29 and destroys but the base is already captured 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.520

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.770
