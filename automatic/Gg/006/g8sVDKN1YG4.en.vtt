00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.650
 the world seems to me that I thought the 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.170
 World Cup of 2010 was going to be the World Cup 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.449
 the transitions of passing in defense 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.930
 and attack attack defense year a little 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.750
 second and I think I was wrong that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.240
 now today is let's say this is the world 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.570
 of transitions in a short time 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.090
 precise and I think that makes the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.910
 parties are parties let's say they split 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 the equipment and finish giving a 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.670
 show that we all like 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.989
 because from there come the occasion 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.850
 of goal and starting at bolt occasions 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.500
 come the goals not that all the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.870
 teams have three or four players 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.400
 with a change of pace looking towards 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.520
 offensive 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.500
 very good before it was hard to see that 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 Swiss present two or three colors fast 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.560
 or kiran present two or three colors 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.630
 fast although costa rica present two or 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.550
 three blocks fast today costa rica 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.380
 Chinese I'm wrong has in exchange for 9 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.970
 which is awesome then always 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.900
 for more than more than the selection of 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.390
 country is in the short history 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.210
 World Cup in these matches always 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.360
 they have presented offensive alternatives 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.190
 with speed and precision then 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.600
 you will also have some shows 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.670
 beautiful and I think that football and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 for years it was ratified in this 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.130
 global and takes it is leading it to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.660
 yes sides we take that feature 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.119
 of young people is physically arriving 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.330
 for the show side well all 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:46.070
 out there they can play a 4-1-4-1 a 4-3-3 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.930
 a 4-2-3-1 a 5-3-2 that 53 of the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.420
 played bilardo in the 90 world and not only 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.770
 that but then the difference is the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.359
 feature of power 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.030
 with the inah presented the 5 3 2 the 3 5 2 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:02.990
 the first game but it was 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.869
 characteristic of the 4-2-3-1 with Brazil 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.909
 from the 70 with pelé points to me silvia 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.909
 rivelinho and up 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.140
 78 today is more physical and characteristic 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.620
 let say 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.620
 also physical 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.640
 robben have all one more change and it is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.829
 faster really but through the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 precision holland has robert in the 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.970
 argentina has messi for me they are 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.520
 much better today than before 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.200
 they are going to tell me no but those days are 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.060
 odious the comparisons and departing 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.980
 that are odious comparisons I have 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.720
 to play melar and if we want to tell you 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.040
 today, players are much more 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.070
 evolved at the time of hitting a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.240
 ball when controlling a ball 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.440
 football has evolved the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.690
 workouts to the evolution of a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 form so remarkable that not only in the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.620
 physical part looks pretty like them 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.360
 hit a central link central link to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.400
 the ball or the goalkeepers as they hit 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.530
 the ball for more than before maybe the most 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.490
 hard but if not and it's not far we go to 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.810
 86 to 90 a goal kick 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.420
 goycochea could not be and if he did 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.160
 came here today any of the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.020
 archers back lower that is to three 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.940
 court rooms and the same for the 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.890
 centrally the same for the flyers the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.470
 thousand for the forwards there is always 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.010
 exceptions the yes maybe the three 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.200
 midfielders from brazil of '70 played 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.670
 also like the monsoon dora spider 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.510
 ahead that's why they marked the story 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.220
 in favor of that candle he always knew that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.160
 I had Messi 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.410
 then he is a very wise person very 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.410
 able to adapt a bit to the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.240
 go ahead to the games that 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.370
 they manage the quality of players that 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.650
 they are managing then it is impossible 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.370
 in putting together a team not through months 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.630
 impossible not to assemble a team where 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.730
 Messi has influence to choose the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.230
 players because you need to feel 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.660
 comfortable I think all the coaches 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.880
 open I think that in that sense 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.040
 would opt for the formula you are opting for 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.769
 know the rais is left out it's very easy 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.260
 speak saying was not of the above not 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.890
 have mobility never 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.560
 he is never a good friend messi a little more 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.380
 higuaín that omen and are players that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.510
 They need to play and from his people 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.490
 from there they make a difference now which 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.260
 it is the coach's merit to understand them 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 manage them 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.280
 obviously give it a defensive and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.100
 it 's not you will never have it with 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.720
 technique software ie the bocyl 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.940
 what guardiola is also not going 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 to have nobody will have them because in 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.200
 that convinces flight that has to do 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:56.340
 with the lateral is not God's coach 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.990
 this is how he punishes him lightly 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.970
 unfairly the situation is defense 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.920
 attack started on the one hand on the other hand 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.110
 we have the balls stopped in the 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.810
 gates and that they try to do it in 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:14.710
 a double touch to finish with center 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:17.980
 and also a little bit in defense of the 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.860
 total football let's say the south where all 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.200
 the leagues is that sometimes they say point that 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.190
 as a moment in a goal on the play if 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.190
 happens to the best elections 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.990
 How it will not happen to any team 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:35.500
 summer soccer football argentina 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.050
 they did not tie him over the time because 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.270
 apart had not many games 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.050
 have defined about the favorite time for 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.210
 the world 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.190
 I am from football always looked for and 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.040
 logical I gave for candidate Spain 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.340
 together with Argentina and Brazil today if I 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.260
 I have to play 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.110
 I look for the logic of Argentina because 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.540
 He has a goal because when he does not 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.130
 messi can do it for Maria when 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.740
 you can do just as you have not yet 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.750
 appeared and when no ball stopped 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.310
 then on the one hand Argentinian on the other 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.180
 local side brazil and on the other hand the 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.180
 german machine
