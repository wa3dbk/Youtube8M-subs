00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 Today I want to show you with us 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.800
 she grew up in my personal custom 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.420
 skin manager funds favorites map skins 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.929
 installed at some asked for it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.030
 had 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.080
 so we go pointing to the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:24.750
 official website google and weighed her 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.939
 or do we already have it ? 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.029
 a download you all and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 have installed and good at kukksi 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 you do not even have the custom skins 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 opened from the internet download 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 the whole thing just the light in the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.899
 Then I go to install skins 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:50.610
 and if you did that then come 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.719
 at instance child an option only 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.629
 xbox.com skins and an option casting 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.760
 skins now it is so wuxi you can 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.230
 not just cash skins from boxee 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.220
 install but generally all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.479
 customs wanted to have cheaper because wuxi 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.799
 Wuxi is still a young boy 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.920
 program I say that now 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.740
 alien beta and what i find out 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.540
 So it works very well, I think 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 that's why I use it on Wednesday too 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.290
 But they could all cost cash skins 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.119
 install so synonymous which the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.210
 centrifugal force or something you can find with 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.369
 grew up for the mine 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.500
 opinion on the whole map skins game you 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 just on youtube.com and we have 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:40.320
 a selection of rapeseed and give it once 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 for the Aramaeans, for example, flying ship 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.590
 or here for the three and 3 with us and we 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.170
 but want to have that envy encounters 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.070
 this is the map to the night hunter ruskin 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.520
 click we also choose here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.850
 then click on gadget and then 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 he goes short 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.770
 and usually here is a download 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.770
 button we just click on it 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.040
 Here you can find the map tempus now 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.380
 when no other options in the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.520
 customer web the wupsi available 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.050
 you can still set, for example 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.940
 Set whether to the day or night 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.970
 you just want to click on it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.730
 on download that takes then I know 15 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.980
 seconds and then we click 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 install and here and we are the green 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.800
 beams and then we already have the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.810
 custom map installs what matters 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.709
 you are allowed only so the launcher could 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.830
 quiet open 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.480
 but in itself you should close with it 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.500
 there are no complications yes and that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.360
 then it was already 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.360
 and then when he goes in the game 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:08.390
 then you have a beautiful custom 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:10.790
 fw moment checkout and I'm pretty much 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:22.040
 cool and I think the map is synonymous 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:25.690
 cream connection euro alright and me 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.920
 think the map is just awesome 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.920
 but always give us a quick look at the ring 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:42.799
 there is the korean language 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.180
 selected and of course the head 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.890
 to the chin on the night hunter map 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 the night hunter skin is played and 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.900
 I think the map so the map is it 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.480
 there is still the ice hits it to the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.500
 wintertime out the one correct correct 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.329
 horny map only three meet I like it 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.850
 with praise so actually best 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.440
 kukksi has a problem you have 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.109
 not so many skins you have one 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.310
 customer risk in luczensky's kassel 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.079
 But everything could be on the website 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.390
 read and a few custom map skins 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.030
 but they do not have that much yet 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.890
 but what you have a custom maps 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.860
 I think that's very good in terms of quality 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.200
 really really good 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.740
 So there are many children on the power 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.350
 they look like shit about it 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.889
 friendly but to formulate 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:41.310
 that's it so the map is simple 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:51.420
 only cream that is 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:53.550
 really nice that should have been 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.050
 from the little guide if still 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.920
 have any questions about kukksi 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.510
 cetera 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:04.050
 then just write it in the 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.400

 Also a special program which I 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.640
