00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.610
 the comet and they are fly over to Mars 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.050
 presented by NASA science throughout the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.090
 world astronomers vibrate 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.180
 anticipating the arrival of the comet and 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 they are the day of thanksgiving of 2013 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.080
 our the visitor side of the system 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.930
 solar outdoor skimming the atmosphere of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 sun and if it survives it could emerge as 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.710
 a bright comet for the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 observers of the heavens in the hemisphere 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.140
 north of the earth first however 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.480
 the comet has to fly over Mars and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360
 they are approaching the red planet 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.890
 says the hormones release of the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.650
 applied physics laboratory of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.799
 college johns hopkins on 1 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.379
 October the comet will go to 0.07 units 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.600
 astronomical of Mars about 6 times 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.940
 closer than he will ever be of the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.949
 land the Martian rovers and the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.619
 satellites will enjoy a privileged 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.720
 first plan is too early to 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.430
 say if the curiosity will be able to see 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.769
 the comet from the surface of Mars 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.260
 that depends on how much the comet shines and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.270
 are between now and then 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 tells them that the best bet is the most 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.370
 they recognize their NASA orbiter 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.900
 satellite m &amp; r o is equipped with a 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.290
 powerful half-meter telescope 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.330
 called iris the one that is more than capable of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.570
 detect the atmosphere of the comet and its 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.050
 tail the observations are planned 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.010
 for four dates on August 20 the 29 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.930
 September and 1 and 2 October iris 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.130
 he was not sent to Mars to do 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 astronomy signals the researcher 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 Main telescope Alfred Mcewen 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.620
 from the University of Arizona the camera 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 is designed to take fast 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.360
 images of Mars the maximum time of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 Exposure is limited in comparison 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.970
 with detectors in other telescopes 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.250
 space 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 this is an important limitation for 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 taking pictures of kite without 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.210
 But I think we're going to detect the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.800
 comet and if the flyby of Mars arrives 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.200
 at a critical moment in the path of 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 comet and they are already just crossed the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.710
 ice line an area in the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 surroundings of the Mars orbit where 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.120
 solar heat is enough to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.310
 start to vaporize the frozen water 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.010
 the volatile compounds in a comet 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.560
 they are 80 to 90 percent water 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.780
 Freeze sign right now in August 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.519
 almost all the water is still frozen 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 and the emission of gases that we see in and are 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.099
 is due to the expulsion of dioxide 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.810
 carbon and other minor constituents 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.120
 probably only isolated areas of 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.220
 core of the comet are active but 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 when the comet and they are crossing the line of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.099
 freezing the entire comet could 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420
 burst into six beings of Felix gas 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.150
 the satellites of Mars will have a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.010
 front row seat the amount of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 gases emitted on Mars will give the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.849
 researchers clues about the size 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.859
 of the nucleus of the comet and they are that it is 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.560
 hidden from view in the depths of 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.180
 the dusty atmosphere of the comet if 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.950
 Jason's core is much bigger 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.290
 of half a kilometer probably 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.540
 will survive your touch with the sun the day 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.159
 of thanksgiving says louis could 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.190
 become one of the most comets 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.810
 spectacular in many years 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.730
 mcewen sees this as a fine- tuning 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.250
 to meet another comet the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.139
 next year the value of the science of the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450
 observation of comet Jason is difficult 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.930
 to predict we have never tried anything 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.700
 well before 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.909
 however this is a good practice 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.819
 for the comet c 2013 a1 also 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.370
 known as the spring cider comet that 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.590
 will go much closer to Mars in 2014 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.900
 for now however all eyes 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.639
 are put on the comet and are a 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.879
 unprecedented number of ships of the 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.260
 nasa 16 observe the comet 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.450
 astronauts on board the station 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.319
 international space will also be 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.389
 observing and meanwhile back in 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.099
 the earth says is working with the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.569
 nasa to organize a campaign of 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.120
 worldwide observation for 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.310
 comet made our goal is that all 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.549
 telescopes on earth point to the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.260
 comet when it emerges from the sun says liz the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.209
 Mars flyby will give us a view 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.739
 prior and will provide the data that 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.560
 we need to predict what 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.569
 we could see for more updates 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.900
 on Mars as comets that are 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.349
 approach you stay tuned to science at
