00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.619
 is a very versatile roller machine 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.369
 designed for pasta processing 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.369
 laminated 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.600

 lamination is carried out with 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.300
 repeated passages the dough is first 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.680
 very thin 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.310
 subsequently the thickness comes 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.310
 increased 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the final phase the thickness comes 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.920
 again reduced 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.310

 pack noodles and spaghetti 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.830
 on the guitar of the desired thickness 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.689
 the strips of dough are rolled up 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.930
 are intended for the preparation of 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.930
 ravioli 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.300

 any type of filling 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.310
 also works with very thin sheets 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.820
 the ravioli are very similar to those 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.820
 handmade 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.819
 on the p1 two can be mounted 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.819
 gnocchi groups of different conception 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.629
 this model works at pressure e 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.629
 produces ball eyes 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.290
 in this model called a cochlea 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:33.749
 the dough is dragged by a propeller 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:35.989
 rotary can work flours of all 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.989
 the types 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.650
 the p1 accepts an extruder group with the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.070
 which is possible to produce pasta 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.070
 extruded 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.360
 applying a rotary knife a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.560
 variable speed is produced 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.560
 short in classic cuts 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.530
 a variant of p1 is the so-called 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.180
 cylinder is free of kneader accepts 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.180
 the same accessories as most
