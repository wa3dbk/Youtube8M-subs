 chips and what we have today is it today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.099
 we have the top 10 most interesting morshin 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.929
 the game without age that I would like to note 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.360
 This game is made in the style of a la Oleg 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 yes vinci 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 that's what actually pleases me love 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 very same game 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 what else would you like to mention this game 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.289
 on neebically quickly gaining 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 popularity therefore would not want 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 miss the chance to say so 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.480
 self-praise so enjoy 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.280
 download so it will be our description 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.540
 ten opens the machine called 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 chaos is what literally translates as 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 sweeper 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.670
 look at her propeller or something 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 call look like such a meat grinder 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.300
 let's see how it is set up 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 quite simple but actually went and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 test her 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.360
 front wheel like or somehow 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.439
 to call well what went further ninth 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 place 9 place we keep the car 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.310
 called mega tank on both sides 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 in the middle we have flamethrowers 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 quite a lot of wheels and in the middle the most 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 most importantly this gun see how it is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 it works here first 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.500
 detail then open this one and then 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.040
 bullet really did not work because I 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 not with a raised highway 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.470
 raise the highway we start that's all 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.600
 gray flamethrowers flamethrowers okay go 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.090
 further eighth in eighth place y 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.079
 us a machine called hot wheels what 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.909
 translated as hot wheels 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.130
 no damage to enemies inflict 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.670
 maybe it's not just fun 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.880
 go still have this car small 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.800
 minus here but such hillocks when she 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.349
 climbs on can easily lose 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.209
 wheels and unfortunately you are no longer 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.030
 ride you see the wheels already 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.480
 lost our propeller profile 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.380
 burn quickly and go to the next 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.870
 car on the 7th place we have a car under 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.690
 All terrain name I do not know how it is 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.470
 translated angle translator did not help me 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.000
 but he called it a tank diesel engine 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 look see how it starts 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.130
 it just starts like a diesel wines on 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.470
 rear wheels she is so childish it 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.830
 my very favorite car I do not understand 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.810
 why is she in seventh place 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.840
 killing power in her right as 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.930
 present flamethrower suspension work 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.019
 good enough true and mind you 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.269
 noticed some bugs in this car that 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.480
 if you start very sharply back 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.310
 can simply break off go 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.040
 farther 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.739
 sixth place and sixth place among us 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.819
 flame thrower bot which translates as 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.280
 robot flamethrower unfortunately full full 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.720
 instructions for use and this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.370
 I did not find the car 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.510
 but that less can control the hand but 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.599
 and flamethrower too 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.549
 drove on fifth place in fifth 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.530
 place we have settled pretty 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.049
 interesting and entertaining and wrinkles under 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.209
 the name of the katin edge of the literal translation 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.690
 I never found out, but she found out 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.549
 translates as either slicing edges or 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.549
 advanced go 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 so they conclude that this 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.560
 the car only gets in three out of ten 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.600
 cases 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.550
 there will be many more factors that 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.640
 depend on where it goes 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.460
 for example good luck and luck go further 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.650
 fourth place machine called 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.959
 compressor just a killing machine but 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.300
 unfortunately show in action i her to you 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.340
 I can not as soon as I have her 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.680
 launching from me immediately goes wild 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.300
 drawdown FPS and sometimes it crumbles 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.820
 crumble the game so see for yourself 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.820
 yourself on the computers go further 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.350
 in second place we have a car under 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.330
 name alternative but this machine 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.000
 added exclusively in new 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.850
 direction as no damage is 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.440
 also does not bring the enemy we will see it in 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.930
 action 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.220
 we just turn the gun 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.810
 rotate our holders and run 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.270
 that's just actually from strength 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.250
 opposing guns gun flies away 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:29.940
 go there to fly here look again 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:35.020
 lower the holders raise the gun 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:39.910
 we start it this way 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:43.030
 the essence of the car went on so the first 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.220
 the place is just a killer catapult i 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.410
 killing machine don't know how else 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.950
 call in general look at it 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.770
 just look at the creation 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.630
 when this yalda goes down she pulls 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.290
 in parallel 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.840
 sells a shell round the chain 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:06.160
 and it lands about somewhere in this 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.150
 radius look to use this 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.570
 guns only need 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:14.250
 only one button is needed and this is up to 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.250
 to reinforce the projectile from fasteners 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.750
 so guys reference on so it will be in 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.930
 description if you liked this video 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.640
 I put the Huskies will be very pleased
