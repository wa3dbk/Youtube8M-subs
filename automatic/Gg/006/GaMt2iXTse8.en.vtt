looked like we were ever gonna be able

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
looked like we were ever gonna be able
to<00:00:21.449> come<00:00:21.570> back<00:00:21.720> into<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.590> they're<00:00:22.680> never

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
looked like there was a plan B from

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.779 
looked like there was a plan B from
Moyes<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.570> they're<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:25.369> he<00:00:26.369> brought<00:00:26.609> on

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
Moyes that they're really he brought on

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
Moyes that they're really he brought on
cleverly<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:27.990> 15<00:00:28.349> minutes

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
cleverly and well back with 15 minutes

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
cleverly and well back with 15 minutes
to<00:00:28.740> go<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.760> played<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.240> half<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.539> hour<00:00:30.890> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
to go but we played for half an hour to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
to go but we played for half an hour to
goal<00:00:32.099> deficit<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> he<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.390> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
goal deficit and he just didn't like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.500 
goal deficit and he just didn't like
there<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> plan<00:00:34.079> B<00:00:34.610> I'm<00:00:35.610> certainly<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
there was a plan B I'm certainly not I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.549 
there was a plan B I'm certainly not I
think<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> more
