00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
base the reason being is if it's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
base the reason being is if it's
silicone<00:00:50.550> based<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.809> very

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
silicone based it can actually be very

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
set up on these areas for just a few

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.179 
set up on these areas for just a few
seconds<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
seconds and then now what I can do is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.120 
seconds and then now what I can do is
simply<00:01:56.579> take<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.090> shop<00:01:57.780> towel<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.920> ahead

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
simply take a shop towel and go ahead

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
simply take a shop towel and go ahead
and<00:01:59.430> evenly<00:02:00.000> spread<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> dressing

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and evenly spread out all the dressing

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.080 
and evenly spread out all the dressing
all<00:02:01.469> over<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.250> different<00:02:02.610> areas<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
all over these different areas now the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.680 
all over these different areas now the
reason<00:02:06.600> why<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.409> shop<00:02:07.829> towel<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
reason why I like to use a shop towel is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
reason why I like to use a shop towel is
it<00:02:09.690> doesn't<00:02:09.959> leave<00:02:10.080> any<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.709> lint

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it doesn't leave any of that lint

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
it doesn't leave any of that lint
like<00:02:11.819> most<00:02:12.090> towels<00:02:12.450> may<00:02:12.810> leave<00:02:13.020> behind

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like most towels may leave behind

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.340 
like most towels may leave behind
such<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.090> turk<00:02:15.360> towels<00:02:15.660> or<00:02:16.110> anything

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
such as like turk towels or anything

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.420 
such as like turk towels or anything
else<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:17.690> well<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.140> doesn't<00:02:19.320> absorb<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.220> lot

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
else as well as it doesn't absorb a lot

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
else as well as it doesn't absorb a lot
of<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.580> dressing<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.840> means<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.140> helps

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
of that dressing so that means it helps

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.610 
of that dressing so that means it helps
us<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:23.210> evenly<00:02:24.210> spread<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
us to really evenly spread out all that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.520 
us to really evenly spread out all that
product<00:02:25.920> instead<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.970> sucking<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:27.570> up<00:02:27.810> or

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
product instead of sucking it all up or

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
product instead of sucking it all up or
soaking<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.610> should<00:02:29.670> say<00:02:49.550> making

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
soaking it all up I should say making

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.590 
soaking it all up I should say making
sure<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:50.940> hit<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.270> all<00:02:51.450> these

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
different containers and lids you can

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.480 
different containers and lids you can
already<00:03:01.350> start<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.770> tell<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.130> giving<00:03:02.370> that

deep black look that these plastics

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:22.900 
deep black look that these plastics
should<00:03:12.480> have

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.330

again if you work in a body shop this

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.980 
again if you work in a body shop this
product<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.030> safe<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.480> use

reach areas especially between these

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.130 
reach areas especially between these
different<00:04:13.370> cracks<00:04:13.850> or<00:04:14.180> crevices<00:04:14.360> like<00:04:15.020> you

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
different cracks or crevices like you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.830 
different cracks or crevices like you
can<00:04:15.260> see<00:04:15.410> here<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:16.280> intake<00:04:16.760> casing<00:04:17.570> and

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
can see here on the intake casing and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.070 
can see here on the intake casing and
hosing<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.590> whatnot<00:04:19.220> all<00:04:19.520> we<00:04:19.670> need<00:04:19.850> to<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.239> is

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
hosing and whatnot all we need to do is

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.230 
hosing and whatnot all we need to do is
simply<00:04:21.560> take<00:04:21.770> an<00:04:21.920> airgun<00:04:22.340> or<00:04:22.610> some<00:04:22.970> type<00:04:23.210> of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
simply take an airgun or some type of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.600 
simply take an airgun or some type of
compressed<00:04:23.810> air<00:04:24.020> tool<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.620> now<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.190> can<00:04:25.430> use

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
compressed air tool and now we can use

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.850 
compressed air tool and now we can use
this<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.570> compressed<00:04:26.960> air<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.350> really<00:04:27.650> even

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
this the compressed air to really even

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.880 
this the compressed air to really even
out<00:04:28.100> any<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.880> excess<00:04:29.660> dressing<00:04:30.290> or<00:04:30.500> again

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
out any of that excess dressing or again

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.170 
out any of that excess dressing or again
to<00:04:31.070> really<00:04:31.430> spread<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.760> out<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:31.880> those

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
to really spread it out on those

00:04:32.180 --> 00:05:10.360 
to really spread it out on those
hard-to-reach<00:04:32.570> areas

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.210 

all<00:05:11.370> right<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:13.350> as<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.560> can<00:05:13.650> see<00:05:13.830> with<00:05:13.980> just<00:05:14.130> a

all right and as you can see with just a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.430 
all right and as you can see with just a
little<00:05:14.460> bit<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.640> effort<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.240> shop<00:05:15.750> towel<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.380> an
