00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.489 
this year they're playing error-free
football<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.359> you<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
football what do you think about the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.529 
football what do you think about the
progress<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.249> rules<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.880> today's<00:01:51.240> game<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
progress of the rules in today's game is

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.480 
progress of the rules in today's game is
it<00:01:51.840> good<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.049> bad<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.399> got

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it good or bad because I know when I got

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
it good or bad because I know when I got
to<00:01:53.609> play<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:53.939> tackle<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> man<00:01:54.509> any<00:01:54.780> way

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to play you could tackle a man any way

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
to play you could tackle a man any way
shape<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.380> form<00:01:55.439> except<00:01:55.950> by<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.069> facemask<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
shape or form except by the facemask and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
shape or form except by the facemask and
they're<00:01:56.850> slowly<00:01:57.060> implement<00:01:57.630> implementing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
they're slowly implement implementing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.969 
they're slowly implement implementing
more<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.189> ways<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.179> tackle<00:02:00.569> I<00:02:00.979> think

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
more and more ways not to tackle I think

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.099 
more and more ways not to tackle I think
that<00:02:02.130> part<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.639> the<00:02:02.700> rules<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.869> safety

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
that part of the rules are for safety

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.529 
that part of the rules are for safety
and<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.909> many<00:02:05.999> people<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.389> getting

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
and because so many people are getting

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.210 
and because so many people are getting
injured<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.350> players<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.889> certainly<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
injured the players are certainly a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.600 
injured the players are certainly a
bigger

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
bigger

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.420 
bigger
faster<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.119> stronger<00:02:09.390> today<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:11.250> like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
faster and stronger today I would like

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.870 
faster and stronger today I would like
to<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.330> defensive<00:02:13.080> backs<00:02:13.490> be<00:02:14.490> able<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to see the defensive backs be able to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.370 
to see the defensive backs be able to
hit<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> receiver<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.630> little<00:02:15.810> bit<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.140> than

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
hit a receiver a little bit more than

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
hit a receiver a little bit more than
than<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.060> speed<00:02:18.510> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
than they are you know with the speed of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.640 
than they are you know with the speed of
the<00:02:18.780> game

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the game

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770 
the game
I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.430> helmet<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.240> helmet<00:02:21.270> hits

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
I think the helmet to helmet hits

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.740 
I think the helmet to helmet hits
eliminating<00:02:22.530> those<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:23.700> rule<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
eliminating those is a good rule but I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.210 
eliminating those is a good rule but I
think<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> whistle<00:02:25.560> gets<00:02:25.740> blown<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> little

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
think the whistle gets blown a little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.060 
think the whistle gets blown a little
too<00:02:26.340> quick<00:02:26.610> sometimes<00:02:27.350> okay<00:02:28.350> dig<00:02:28.590> let's<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
too quick sometimes okay dig let's just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.160 
too quick sometimes okay dig let's just
say<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.120> were<00:02:30.270> putting<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.600> pads<00:02:30.870> back

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
say that you were putting the pads back

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
say that you were putting the pads back
on<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.620> Sunday<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.160> playing<00:02:32.430> safety<00:02:32.820> for
