the grip will loosen the glue and allow

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
the grip will loosen the glue and allow
you<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.990> slip<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.320> grips<00:01:10.619> away<00:01:10.860> easily<00:01:11.070> now

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you to slip the grips away easily now

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.910 
you to slip the grips away easily now
the<00:01:11.729> grips<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.270> off<00:01:12.420> time<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> reattach<00:01:13.680> the

the grips are off time to reattach the
new<00:01:14.070> ones<00:01:14.280> first<00:01:14.970> give<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> bar<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.320> clean

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
new ones first give the bar a good clean

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.100 
new ones first give the bar a good clean
to<00:01:16.860> remove<00:01:17.130> any<00:01:17.340> old<00:01:17.670> glue<00:01:17.940> or<00:01:18.119> residue<00:01:18.570> make

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
to remove any old glue or residue make

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.370 
to remove any old glue or residue make
sure<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.500> bar<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.710> dry<00:01:20.990> when<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.170> doing

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
sure the bar is dry when you're doing

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
sure the bar is dry when you're doing
the<00:01:22.500> throttle<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:23.039> it's<00:01:23.399> also<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.060> idea

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the throttle side it's also a good idea

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
the throttle side it's also a good idea
to<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.289> tape<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> end<00:01:26.190> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to just put some tape over the end to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.899 
to just put some tape over the end to
cover<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.940 

the<00:01:32.450> tape<00:01:32.719> prevents<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.259> glue<00:01:33.469> from<00:01:33.679> being

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
the tape prevents the glue from being

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.739 
the tape prevents the glue from being
pushed<00:01:34.219> into<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.460> throttle<00:01:34.969> when<00:01:35.359> you<00:01:35.509> push

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
pushed into the throttle when you push

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:38.230 
pushed into the throttle when you push
the<00:01:35.929> grips<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.319> it's<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.280> good<00:01:37.460> idea<00:01:37.609> to<00:01:37.819> prevent

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the grips on it's a good idea to prevent

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.969 
the grips on it's a good idea to prevent
this<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.630> if<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:38.899> happens<00:01:39.469> then<00:01:39.770> your

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
this as if that happens then your

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.830 
this as if that happens then your
throttle<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.460> likely<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.909> stick<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.420> no<00:01:41.689> one

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
throttle is likely to stick and no one

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.830 
throttle is likely to stick and no one
wants<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.759> apply<00:01:43.759> an<00:01:43.939> even<00:01:44.090> amount<00:01:44.359> of<00:01:44.569> glue

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
wants that apply an even amount of glue

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.569 
wants that apply an even amount of glue
to<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.079> inside<00:01:45.469> of<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.679> grip<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.069> if<00:01:46.429> you're

using contact adhesive like us carefully

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.370
