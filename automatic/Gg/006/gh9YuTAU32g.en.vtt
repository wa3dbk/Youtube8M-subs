00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
after the recall I was thinking that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.550 
after the recall I was thinking that
actually<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.759> had<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> take<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
actually we had to take it out to it a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399 
actually we had to take it out to it a
low<00:02:05.219> enough<00:02:05.460> damage<00:02:06.049> where<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.290> take<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
low enough damage where I could take it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.180 
low enough damage where I could take it
out<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.119> ice<00:02:09.119> shard<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> he's<00:02:11.099> probably

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
out with a ice shard so he's probably

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.660 
out with a ice shard so he's probably
gonna<00:02:11.430> sucker<00:02:11.700> punch<00:02:11.970> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
gonna sucker punch so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.290 
gonna sucker punch so
I<00:02:12.700> shard<00:02:13.620> predicting<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> punch<00:02:15.300> yep

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
happened to me before I was very

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.839 
happened to me before I was very
confused<00:05:26.590> with<00:05:26.949> it<00:05:27.039> actually<00:05:27.250> can<00:05:27.550> happen

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849

have<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.030> research<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.659> I<00:05:29.380> found<00:05:29.530> out<00:05:29.770> that

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
have to research it and I found out that

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.620 
have to research it and I found out that
I<00:05:29.979> can<00:05:30.370> happen<00:05:30.639> but<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.940> chances<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.509> are

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
very very very low so this would be the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.320 
very very very low so this would be the
second<00:05:35.710> video<00:05:35.830> uploaded<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:36.550> I<00:05:36.789> don't<00:05:37.090> make<00:05:37.240> it
