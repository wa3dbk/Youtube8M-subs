 I am to follow and I am as always 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.909
 accompanied by Claudia Quiros who today 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.439
 is going to talk a lot about the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.909
 team taking friend we started a 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.369
 new week with a lot of content and 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.039
 we continue with the whole xbox theme 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.750
 john before playstation 4 and we have a 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.090
 couple of reviews these weeks of 2 liters 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.579
 of this new console is about rise and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.610
 of strength 5 but let's love week 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.380
 with rise title that the truth is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.270
 I expected a lot and I really have 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 raring because it is removed from 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 that the study that is very well known 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.299
 for delivering fantastic experiences 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.310
 that while the game is not bad you end up 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.069
 for being a bit repetitive but yes 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.840
 visually it is impressive that is 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.679
 visually impeccable but you know that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.220
 cloud 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.349
 I think he suffers from not being so deep 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.659
 as an action game maybe it 's 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.099
 as you see that to all the generation that 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.110
 can enjoy this game what is going to 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.360
 keep enjoying but I think for 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.550
 those that we have played during all these 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.520
 years maybe it can be a little 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.530
 I do not know empty all this wave of combat 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.630
 I think I think he has a presentation 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.550
 impeccable but I think it stays a little 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.030
 short I think that in general people have 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.620
 been with a little bit is unfair and so 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.690
 also what the criticism seems to me 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.030
 it's a good title I do not think it's the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.250
 better effectively but all the whole 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.140
 thematic the romans all the fighting 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.560
 that are very bloody very visceral 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.000
 the combinations of the combos me 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.960
 they attract a lot of attention 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.630
 friend but the truth is that it is not the 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.380
 better game but neither is it the worst and 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 that you know that of course there is going to be a certain 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.860
 market 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.500
 the uncle or the guy who just bought the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.330
 xbox to play fifa that will be 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.460
 delighted there is that his game looks 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.380
 like a movie you know going on all the 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.510
 people are like us who are 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.430
 looking for a video game to exploit the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.700
 unique mechanics of the medium if not so much 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.650
 what will people see and what will be 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.840
 delighted to have a title so I know 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.000
 see so it's played so I can 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.980
 boast well and I think there's a 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.430
 important market that I think is going to 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.829
 be very happy 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.359
 I believe it too but it's not called my 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.640
 better let's see the review to 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.829
 then the rise is exclusive of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.269

 hard review gamers 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.810
 prom 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.000
 your name is mark used and you are a 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.430
 soldier of Rome who has inherited from his 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.410
 father the vocation to defend the empire 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.780
 worn in this pride for being a 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.540
 elite warrior joins in revenge 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.360
 to see that the barbarians have not only 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.660
 devastated with your people but also have 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.120
 annihilated the ones you love the most 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.140

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.390
 rise and found white ex studio 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.240
 recognized for its powerful deployments 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.310
 graphics has joined microsoft for 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.710
 deliver a title with which you can 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.620
 take advantage of everything the new xbox one 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.780
 offers in potential with a project that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.390
 input was designed for kinect 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.720
 today we have a hack and slash that has 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.910
 your identity signs if you have your 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.040
 disposition attacks of various types 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 with which you can annihilate 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.550
 barbarians to your liking 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.650
 after giving them enough 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.900
 blows you have the opportunity to execute 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.150
 the consequences that will test 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.910
 your speed and precision with the buttons 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.080
 as a reward the blood and the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.199
 brutality sells 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.139
 to your screen the combat unlike 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.689
 other games is not frantic it's rather 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.150
 a leisurely experience that reduces your 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.090
 rhythm even more at the moment of executing 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.699
 an opponent for the greedy purists of 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.830
 action this cadence may result in 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.680
 a negative point added to that by 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.439
 somewhat long lapses you will not have enemies to 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.870
 the view in addition to the rhythm another detail 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:04.419
 that may not like you are the sections 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.789
 in first person not only do they break a 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.009
 little with the title action but that 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.349
 you feel a little contribution outside of 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.979
 change perspective when using certain 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.409
 weapons a somewhat forced aspect more than 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.300
 give a new notion of game seems 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.569
 that the intention is to show the potential 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.849
 graphic and talking about it the game looks 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.909
 very well and it gets over their 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.099
 contemporaries in their generation not only 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.409
 there are realistic faces and lighting 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.509
 spectacular also takes hold of 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.120
 artistic details like animation of 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.039
 High quality and even relief modeling 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.060
 that help tell the story of a 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.070
 out of this world mode 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.230
 few games reach a level of 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.450
 so peculiar detail although you have to 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.810
 admit that the possibilities make 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.120
 something great to the game 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.550
 visually the game is amazing without 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.380
 But for fans of the genre 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.020
 possibilities can be a little 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.320
 limited is only a matter of taking you 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.169
 Honey though the blood calls in a case 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.639
 like this yes that phrase can be 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.800
