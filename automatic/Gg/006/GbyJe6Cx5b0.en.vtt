00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.130
 Hmm 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740
 I'm wearing 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.880
 iq is a game that sinks cubes coming from the front 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.260
 Minutes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.130
 The player can mark on the stage on the stage by pressing the circle button 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.110
 I will 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:43.760
 And if you press the circle button again, the mark will disappear and it will disappear 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.050
 We will sink the cube in this sequence of marking and release 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.820
 So let's submerged cube 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:58.980
 First mark where you want to sink the cube 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 And I say turn off the mark and press again circle button when the cube is riding on it 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.399
 You can quench the cube 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.450
 In this way we will sink the cubes one after another 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.369
 Poop 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.789
 pango 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.080
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.960
 Oops 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.550
 If you threaten for 9 minutes 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.690
 When the number accumulated and dropped on the block meter exceeds the meter 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.410
 The day will collapse for a second 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.410
 dee 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.530
 Players must begin not to drop cubes from the stage 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 It is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.480
 Hmm 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.120
 It is game over when the player falls from the stage 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.749
 The score is determined by the number of cubes sunk and how it is sunk, and iq is calculated based on it. 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.749
 I will 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.500
 Medium level 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.180
 Does not guarantee that may be submerged all of the cube 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.569
 Hmm 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.239
 You say this cube with the defense minute cube 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.239
 Don't sink this 9 minutes only 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.020
 If you sink by mistake 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:49.350
 Hmm 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.350
 One per line stage is deviated 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.930
 car 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.430
 car 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.459
 Let Forbidden Cube flow before the calmed stage 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.459
 Hmm 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.840
 You can play the cube faster by pressing the close button 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.790
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.159
 Advantage 9 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.169
 It is effective to use the Advantage cube to effectively cool the cube 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.169
 Hmm 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.700
 This cube is called an advantage cube 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.010
 me 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.090
 Location submerged and submerged the advantage cube is marked in green triangle next to the button 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.030
 When you press the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:57.969
 You can spread the explosion around the area around the mark 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:01.689
 All cubes in this area will be sunk 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.340
 Let's use the Advantage cube 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.820
 Hmm 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.910
 First of all, Advantage cube calms down 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.910
 Then press the triangle button to explode 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.350
 p ah ah 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:27.280
 Grab an advantage cube like this and sink 90 for efficiency 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.280
 Let's careful not this time sinking a broom mound part 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760
 Hmm 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.730
 p ah ah
