 that can download and then nothing is a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:27.269
 game to spend time too much 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:30.539
 well maybe the word is ambled 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.239
 a very simple game to play a single 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.050
 finger let's play with raffle 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.700
 those barrels are broken and the sense 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 that we have to go grabbing say 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 from us a tsunami of shells from 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.690
 banana then we have to go running 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 for when it is loading and we are going to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 that line above we see this I think that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 I'm going to load it look out we get it looks 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.750
 parachute without creating tight the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.740
 screen 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.740
 I love music 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 promises to seriously promise to pass the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.310
 time with our users and not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 they are surpassing imposed something like this 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 I remembered 25 I do not know if they ever played 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.780
 that game but that game 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.220
 of penal already with football we can go 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.619
 breaking things like this to enter 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 the mine already explain what is that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.110
 claw that is filling you're grabbing 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.289
 bananas up I want to know how much hard 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.289
 He said 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.369
 the mother or that here I do not have hearts 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.009
 to go back out because I was 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.289
 playing and spend more hearts but I can 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.420
 show them something that would be what the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.970
 store where we can buy souvenirs 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.780
 for the egg because here is the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.600
 store and here we can buy hats 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.640
 improvements parachute objects that I have 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.819
 our achievements and superpowers because 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.069
 here let's say improvements true for the monkey 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.920
 so it's not so much to say that we have 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.460
 let's say in this game we say a thousand thousand 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 30 and 39 bananas are bananas 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.420
 they're worth it, we can not buy anything 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.160
 is they will give you a multicolor 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.130
 ok I know it's a super banana that speaks 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.420
 with 30 bananas in each 100 more 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.070
 possibilities of appearing I do not know in what 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:47.690
 consists of what I do not understand very well is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:51.200
 but let's see how it will return to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.800
 play and think so much like with that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.980
 again I do not really love 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.100
 as I totally recommend them 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.680
 recommended 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.510
 and I invite you to download it 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.860
 I would like to know for those who always knew 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.710
 the pla so interested and used but I 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.020
 call curiosity call curiosity 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.230
 I wonder if it appears while I'm 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.230
 Playing 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:29.519

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.950

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.459

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:53.099
 invites you to download this super mega 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:57.090
 game and something that we noticed that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.949
 apparently the most split screens 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.139
 I never think it's the same 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.689
 and if you thought that the same thing would come to 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.389
 front never apparently vinyl 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:09.389
 Exactly the same, nobody is chrome 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.799
 nike cap if they like to download no 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.799
