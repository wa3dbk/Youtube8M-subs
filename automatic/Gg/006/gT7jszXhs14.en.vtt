00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.490
 manas pesioen image times break i have 2003 with this will i have it to my 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 make sense to people complain but I got you that game though I'm not much better he 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.530
 debuted against it made opened with your boots build that dear chua 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.069
 I really like that you have a place to start with this third 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.589
 school for the playstation to watch 3 games 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.070
 van pelt count 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.500
 but hendriks I then you have not read well and Annick Boer for one 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.910
 over after there is best waiting waiting waiting who may already know 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.710
 not to that 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.730
 also rightly all the same stabbing of the 2 euros it costs shipping 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.910
 so yes I expected quite a short term that the animal post office had it 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.650
 idea that this time to the bottom 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.850
 as a post office for the pvda that is very handy not at the van petten 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.220
 the cloths and is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.580
 he said type's send in three fields 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.409
 the 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:45.300
 and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 He has been staying there all kinds of activities since the news came out 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.450
 what they are actually looking at i could tell people could 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.530
 listened to Kate 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.580
 but the camera is also the real counterparty for you 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 anderlecht gets to throw in the fight 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.090
 repels the cashier 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
 that is the doll but that there is something in it is a bit afraid of it 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.120
 to go this year 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.290
 the queue at the start was not special I have no idea 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.660
 really intense extracts a lot of Turks as hard measures that both sides 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.700
 use 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 and look further 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 this is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.700
 they are never shown I actually have the game myself I have never had 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.610
 heard but it will succeed said McClaren is happy 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.180
 well with the god 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.950
 that much time to mourn yet from peer 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 empty 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.580
 they must recognize 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 nijmegen 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.150
 I think yes then threw the plans 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 and then this one 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.440
 this is a large-scale practice 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.260
 Grab all that shit 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.810
 cryptic just next to the asylum year you are dead on a previously reported hand 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.080
 after all, if you missed out on the bad news for this game 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.170
 members of state warriors 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.360
 the prince ada the awards that are how many are best that it is just whole 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.800
 what a star wars a note at the quake 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.990
 read aloud 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.720
 at fc ekeren killer was already a group with singer from it is original as you 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.710
 would be ready he would also like that it is possible 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.420
 at the trucks and we have loved that week while on it 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 game itself game itself some cross section a lot of music composed by the problem 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.989
 get even more bullshit 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.869
 greetings from daf the neighborhoods me so after a while storming a 6 9 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.779
 time the cat out lesson at other may we have to go back darley have fun 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.019
 would put this game to the other side 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.120
 pita simplified waste of course you know it's all people that's simple 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.959
 turn 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.919
 intensity of 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.999
 pity that before I have never been there army we played today I have 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.119
 played at the bhoys very much 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.149
 so i have lego star wars and we still have a late game 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.229
 spam eagle 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.319
 we have 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.389
 but open again this year 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.799
 the king is making the doll as usual 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.539
 the church 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.539
 or the sudden and we have 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.099
 world equally can interest 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.010
 thousands of them twice that is well 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.769
 not very useful the fact that working parents did how they build it 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.989
 namely very much 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.599
 people have won a little bit, maybe a little bit 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.769
 pathetic if you turn now too I have sent you and more room 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.829
 and those also at the ret the dead are certain but yes that makes it even worse 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.439
 In addition, it was also said that was not 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.429
 in 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.829
 for me by things like two platforms or outside the set win at the ps 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.759
 schagerbrug 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.109
 in any case all three thank you very much I am going to throw in on hold 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.470
 nine further wins 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.980
 I want to have had to tell more for years anyway, is already legal anyway 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.440
 start completely saja I do so that the army the potter is still legal 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.059
 starting value also very bold 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.569
 and after standard water that this 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.039
 i don't know i'm going to be a potential of the bloody mondays what vs 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.019
 but the one on your poster today presented today what is good 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.049
 so that money and the top man are the record 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.879
 we then watch this series i still have to have seventeen fitters 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.239
 PellÃ¨ is probably not sent between that spicy 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.459
 to make statements about 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.009
 the individual time trial video that it's posting the first time
