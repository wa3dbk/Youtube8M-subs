00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello guys today I present a game 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 fearfully funny it comes to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.670
 Fanta shoots a ghost game that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.420
 we have two versions version 1.0 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.099
 the original one the evolved version 2.0 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.250
 we will believe later 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.140
 we leave immediately from the fanta shots 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 the protagonist of the game as you see is the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 baldove bog with some ghosts 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 careless lover of photography who 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 in the cellar of your own castle 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 activated a camera that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.329
 but being unable to do, he takes pictures 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 with the wrong colors and the scraps he makes 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.840
 this camera is the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.280
 game cards we have a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 layout 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 but let me see immediately how it works 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 these are the cards how the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 game to understand how fun it is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.510
 because it makes us mess up the mind 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 we will have to reason both in a way 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 correct than the opposite then 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 we prepare the playing field field of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.379
 game prepares so we put at the center 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.910
 our deck of our cards 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.159
 and the five objects we have a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.159
 arrangement or plasma 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.159
 bottle 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.119
 the book the armchair and the mouse 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 must have been the scope of all 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 players that the player each is of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.259
 long player here I am ok and also 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 of course and the cards you can play at 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.500
 maximum up to 8 players and is a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.850
 game recommended for ages 8 and up 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.159
 a lot and I have to say I enjoyed it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 I had a lot of fun playing with it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 then let's see immediately how to play 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.420
 let's take a slow example first but for 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.090
 which one player was the last one he was in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 cellar of his life turns the paper in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.610
 in this case we look at the paper let's see it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 drinking 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 we have a red mouse that grabs 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
 a blue glass bottle as you see 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.909
 in this case no object 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.950
 corresponds to those represented in the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 home because little mouse and gray the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 bottle and green so at this point 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 we must not take any of the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.610
 objects that we see because they are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.080
 wrong colorless 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.270
 we must take the only object that 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.180
 here we do not see represented in this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.830
 case is the baldove ghost being ai 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.270
 two players in this case the first 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 who can take it by doing this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.540
 reasoning wins the single march in the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 game 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 and if by chance I can take the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.130
 ghost what I do I win the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.410
 card and said aside because after the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 player with the most cards 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
 will succeed in winning if by chance I instead 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.300
 wrong 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.140
 so I'm faster than the other 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.120
 player and I take the picture from the Russian 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
 or too much, for example, I think 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 which after is maritan gray red thing 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.390
 happens I have to leave the card aside 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.700
 here as you see next to March 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 this card will be taken by the winner 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.320
 of the successive marches you can 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.080
 accumulate the cards of those who made a mistake 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.420
 ok now let's do a demonstration of the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.560
 next card in this case like 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.450
 see we have a gray mouse then 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.090
 in the right color at this point 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.040
 that we have to take another player 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 as you can see he got me the little mouse from 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.540
 correct color you guessed it takes 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.549
 the card and move on to the next yes 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 also takes the paper in the mac 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.640
 wrong instead said now let's do one 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 really fast we enter the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.580
 competition 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.470
 ok at this point it's up to the player who 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.170
 high won the zuri card well 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.640
 both of them already screwed my chair 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.000
 ok taking chase all cassandra him 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.010
 detects a card where said red is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.959
 both went when white wine ok 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.730
 fantastic the card is mine now it's up 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.480
 turn 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.519
 let's see let's see there with the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.049
 correct to the object that was perfect 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.549
 this we put back at the center here 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.680
 repaired minds of the employees and we return 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.810
 the cards we complain eventually want 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.709
 also back we find so many cards if 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.660
 we are two 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.760
 in the end the player with the most wins 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.730
 cards also did next to jerks 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.290
 2.0 protagonist a fantasy like 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.140
 see bathroom lovers 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.659
 of the castle in this case the game of 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.069
 all similar if we play individually 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.939
 then as a single click release 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.640
 everywhere 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.359
 after 5 certain in this case a carpet 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.420
 a fairy lines a frog a tank from 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.069
 bathroom and a hairbrush e 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.989
 we have delegated deck of cards of 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.789
 all the same as the previous one with objects 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.769
 right wrong of the right color in the 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.539
 course is wrong then the game from 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.949
 only to beat the zero point is played 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.660
 how he sings shots 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.360
 if you have both as in my case 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.979
 we can play together veil arrange 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.710
 as you see all five objects of the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.960
 two fanta shots mix half papers of 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.180
 one in half cards of the other and after 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.810
 proceed with the game in the same 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.360
 the way we would have proceeded in the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.490
 single way then in the box 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.280
 single game but of course we have to 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.139
 succeed when we have a card a 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
 understand that we are not playing in 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.620
 cellar in these hours in the bathroom in this 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.870
 case because a book from the mouse 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.720
 but we are playing in the cellar so a 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.610
 additional difficulty level after 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.650
 that I have not explained to you those who are i 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.720
 difficulty levels that you find later 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.669
 also in the manual this is the person 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.070
 simple to play but in the manual then 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.380
 we have also available thanks 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.229
 we also have several available 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.180
 different ways and rules 18 where not 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.220
 we really need to take the subject 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.960
 right but I have to scream his name or 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.940
 also use foreign languages ​​for 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.820
 to do so there are combinations for which 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.289
 if we play together with fanta 12.0 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.300
 etc is the right item in the card 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.090
 we must go and get that of 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.280
 identical color that is in the other in 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.860
 with cellar or in the bathroom and away 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.930
 saying that many more variants therefore 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.330
 get acquainted you the game can 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.780
 change then last even longer in the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.729
 time 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.300
 these are make shots and I take shots 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.010
 2.0 edits from united games is really 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.110
 very funny i also like the 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.940
 pocket format because they are portable from 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.380
 journey are those games that can 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.810
 playing does not know is not a preparation 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.630
 second really suitable for all 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.360
