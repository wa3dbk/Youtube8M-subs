introduced in Minecraft 1.8 have
provided<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.580> with<00:00:14.610> quite<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> bit<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.179> fun<00:00:15.360> over

the<00:00:15.780> past<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.199> I've<00:00:16.470> done<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> ton<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> redstone

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609

the past and I've done a ton of redstone
contraptions<00:00:18.150> feature<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.600> them<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:19.350> I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
contraptions feature in them so what I

contraptions feature in them so what I
thought<00:00:19.619> I'd<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.130> little<00:00:20.369> summary<00:00:20.699> video

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is if you do like this kind of video

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.700 
is if you do like this kind of video
then<00:00:27.210> please<00:00:27.359> usual<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.170> ban<00:00:28.349> and

then please usual to that like ban and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.320 
then please usual to that like ban and
I'll<00:00:28.800> crack<00:00:29.039> straight<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> few<00:00:30.150> more

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
I'll crack straight on and do a few more

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
I'll crack straight on and do a few more
of<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.599> anyway<00:00:31.320> letting<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:31.710> way<00:00:31.830> around

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of them anyway letting your way around

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.920 
of them anyway letting your way around
let's<00:00:32.579> take<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.030> at<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.450> I've<00:00:33.570> got<00:00:33.600> for

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
let's take a look at what I've got for

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
let's take a look at what I've got for
you<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.290> thought<00:00:35.160> I'd<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.460> things<00:00:35.700> started

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you I thought I'd get things started

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.760 
you I thought I'd get things started
with<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> simplest<00:00:37.050> ones<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
with one of the simplest ones this is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
with one of the simplest ones this is
the<00:00:37.920> first<00:00:38.219> thing<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> comes<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> mind<00:00:39.149> when

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the first thing that comes to mind when

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
the first thing that comes to mind when
you<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.719> slime<00:00:39.960> blocks<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you think of slime blocks and that is to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
you think of slime blocks and that is to
launch<00:00:41.219> yourself<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.780> entities

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
launch yourself and other entities

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
launch yourself and other entities
around<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.579> hopping<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
around as you can see I'm hopping up and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.610 
around as you can see I'm hopping up and
down<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.200> slime<00:00:46.410> block

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
down right now on this slime block

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
down right now on this slime block
having<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.219> whale<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.210> armor

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
having a whale of a time with my armor

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
having a whale of a time with my armor
stand<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> pretty<00:00:49.770> cool<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
stand really is pretty cool and it's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209 
stand really is pretty cool and it's
very<00:00:50.700> simple<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.800> use<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
very simple as well you can use them to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
very simple as well you can use them to
create<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.820> cool-looking<00:00:54.000> waves<00:00:54.449> using

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
create really cool-looking waves using

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
create really cool-looking waves using
both<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> slime<00:00:55.469> blocks<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> also<00:00:56.460> entities

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
both the slime blocks and also entities

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
both the slime blocks and also entities
to<00:00:57.300> push<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.660> around<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> see

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
to push them around and as you can see

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
to push them around and as you can see
you<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.579> nice<00:00:59.820> little<00:01:00.059> effect<00:01:00.210> now

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you get a really nice little effect now

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
you get a really nice little effect now
most<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> probably<00:01:01.230> recognize<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
most of you probably recognize this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500 
most of you probably recognize this
system<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> video<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.149> did<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.480> couple

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
system from a video that I did a couple

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.399 
system from a video that I did a couple
of<00:01:03.840> weeks<00:01:03.989> ago

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
of weeks ago

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
of weeks ago
I've<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:04.830> managed<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> create<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.700> vertical

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I've also managed to create a vertical

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570 
I've also managed to create a vertical
wave<00:01:06.390> system<00:01:06.810> we'll<00:01:07.229> take<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> look<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.860> now

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
wave system we'll take a look at now now

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
wave system we'll take a look at now now
this<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.119> fairly<00:01:09.299> similar<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
this one is fairly similar to the one

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.780 
this one is fairly similar to the one
that<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> featured<00:01:10.830> except<00:01:11.310> instead<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that I just featured except instead of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
that I just featured except instead of
using<00:01:11.970> slime<00:01:12.330> blocks<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> push<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
using slime blocks to push all of the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
using slime blocks to push all of the
armored<00:01:13.590> stands<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.220> actually<00:01:14.880> uses

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
armored stands back it actually uses

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149 
armored stands back it actually uses
gravity<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.380> gives<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.799> slightly

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
gravity now this gives a slightly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
gravity now this gives a slightly
different<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> wave<00:01:18.090> instead<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
different look to the wave instead of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
different look to the wave instead of
having<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.049> sawtooth<00:01:19.350> type<00:01:19.860> thing<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
having a sawtooth type thing you get a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
having a sawtooth type thing you get a
since<00:01:21.060> odio<00:01:21.390> wave<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.960> pretty<00:01:22.320> cool<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
since odio wave which is pretty cool and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980 
since odio wave which is pretty cool and
on<00:01:23.070> top<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> observe

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
on top of all of this you get to observe

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
on top of all of this you get to observe
the<00:01:25.140> damping<00:01:25.500> effect<00:01:25.619> caused<00:01:26.070> by<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> slime

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the damping effect caused by the slime

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
the damping effect caused by the slime
blocks<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.020> because

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
blocks which I really quite like because

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.310 
blocks which I really quite like because
I'm<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> nerd<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> little

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I'm a bit of a nerd this one is a little

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
I'm a bit of a nerd this one is a little
bit<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.560> obscure<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> others

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bit more obscure than some of the others

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
bit more obscure than some of the others
but<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.240> use<00:01:33.450> slime<00:01:33.869> blocks<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but you can actually use slime blocks to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
but you can actually use slime blocks to
pick<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.710> sand<00:01:35.040> blocks<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
pick up sand blocks which i think is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
pick up sand blocks which i think is
fairly<00:01:36.240> interesting<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
fairly interesting all you have to do is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
fairly interesting all you have to do is
flick<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.220> leaf<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
flick this leaf right here and as you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
flick this leaf right here and as you
can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.810> sand<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> transported<00:01:41.130> upwards

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
can see the sand is transported upwards

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
can see the sand is transported upwards
by<00:01:42.060> our<00:01:42.270> slime<00:01:42.540> blocks<00:01:42.810> relatively<00:01:43.439> quickly

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
by our slime blocks relatively quickly

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
by our slime blocks relatively quickly
and<00:01:44.009> brought<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.700> into<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> position<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.840> at

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and brought up into this position up at

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
and brought up into this position up at
the<00:01:46.049> top<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.680> quite<00:01:46.920> fun<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> play<00:01:47.369> around

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the top it's quite fun to play around

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.160 
the top it's quite fun to play around
with<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.180> circuit<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> quite

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
with and the circuit really is quite

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
with and the circuit really is quite
easy<00:01:49.350> however<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> can't<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
easy however I can't really think of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.899 
easy however I can't really think of
many<00:01:51.479> uses<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.259> maybe<00:01:52.619> let<00:01:52.799> me<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.040> when

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
many uses for it maybe let me know when

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
many uses for it maybe let me know when
I<00:01:53.939> found<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> slime<00:01:54.630> blocks<00:01:54.869> were<00:01:54.990> being

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I found out the slime blocks were being

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.420 
I found out the slime blocks were being
introduced<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> game<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.369> were

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
introduced into the game and they were

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
introduced into the game and they were
going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> launch<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> player<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to launch the player up into the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
going to launch the player up into the
air

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
air

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.020

the<00:01:58.619> first<00:01:58.950> idea<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.490> came<00:01:59.670> into<00:01:59.820> my<00:01:59.909> mind

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the first idea that came into my mind

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.600 
the first idea that came into my mind
was<00:02:00.360> slime<00:02:01.020> block<00:02:01.259> piston<00:02:01.649> elevator<00:02:02.070> now

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
was slime block piston elevator now

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.039 
was slime block piston elevator now
sadly<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.659> harder<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
sadly it was a little bit harder to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.300 
sadly it was a little bit harder to
build<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:04.979> unreliable

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
build and a little bit more unreliable

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.249 
build and a little bit more unreliable
than<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.880> first<00:02:06.090> planned<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.200> see

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
than I first planned but as you can see

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
than I first planned but as you can see
from<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.740> prototype<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:09.000> working

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
from this prototype it is all working

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
from this prototype it is all working
okay<00:02:09.810> over<00:02:10.229> short<00:02:10.500> distances<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:11.430> still

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
okay over short distances it's still

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
okay over short distances it's still
pretty<00:02:11.940> cool<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.690> lot<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.930> fun<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.200> use

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
pretty cool and it's a lot of fun to use

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.080 
pretty cool and it's a lot of fun to use
much<00:02:13.709> better<00:02:13.980> than<00:02:14.099> those<00:02:14.220> piston<00:02:14.640> elevators

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
much better than those piston elevators

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.510 
much better than those piston elevators
anyway<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.160> slightly<00:02:17.430> more

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
anyway this is one of the slightly more

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.160 
anyway this is one of the slightly more
silly<00:02:17.879> ones<00:02:18.150> I'm<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.840> showing<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
silly ones I'm going to be showing you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.449 
silly ones I'm going to be showing you
today<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.920> call<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.220> mod

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
today but I like to call it the mod

today but I like to call it the mod
blender<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.330> certainly<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.870> quite<00:02:22.170> funny

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
blender and it certainly is quite funny

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.260

experience the Guardians seem to wear

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.119 
experience the Guardians seem to wear
the<00:02:27.780> best<00:02:27.989> simply<00:02:28.440> because<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.920> flop

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
the best simply because they just flop

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.589 
the best simply because they just flop
around<00:02:29.280> everywhere<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:30.000> mean<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.360> start

that<00:02:44.550> came<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.849> mind<00:02:45.000> relatively<00:02:45.599> quickly

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that came to mind relatively quickly

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.449 
that came to mind relatively quickly
when<00:02:46.080> slime<00:02:46.349> blocks<00:02:46.590> were<00:02:46.680> introduced<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
when slime blocks were introduced but

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.160 
when slime blocks were introduced but
sadly<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> lot<00:02:48.300> more<00:02:48.510> complicated<00:02:48.840> than

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
sadly it was a lot more complicated than

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.410 
sadly it was a lot more complicated than
I<00:02:49.319> first<00:02:49.530> imagined<00:02:50.180> armorstands<00:02:51.180> when<00:02:51.300> they

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
I first imagined armorstands when they

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.610 
I first imagined armorstands when they
hit<00:02:51.569> slime<00:02:51.870> blocks<00:02:52.110> will<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:52.530> be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
hit slime blocks will actually be

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.500 
hit slime blocks will actually be
bounced<00:02:53.010> upwards<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:54.030> designing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
bounced upwards which make designing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.030 
bounced upwards which make designing
this<00:02:54.629> thing<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> lot<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.440> difficult<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:55.920> as

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this thing a lot more difficult and as

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.229 
this thing a lot more difficult and as
you<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.459> I've<00:02:56.730> had<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.209> some

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
you can see I've had to do some

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.240 
you can see I've had to do some
fandangled<00:02:57.959> stuff<00:02:58.260> we<00:02:58.409> compressed<00:02:58.800> ice<00:02:58.980> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
fandangled stuff we compressed ice and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.580 
fandangled stuff we compressed ice and
regular<00:02:59.909> Pistons<00:03:00.300> down<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.349> did

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
regular Pistons down there but I did

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.839 
regular Pistons down there but I did
manage<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.920> achieve<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> effect<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.760> I
