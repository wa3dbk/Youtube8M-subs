there's<00:01:12.360> lots<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.869> times<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.560> surge

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
there's lots of times where they surge

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
there's lots of times where they surge
and<00:01:14.390> athletes<00:01:15.390> need<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> teach<00:01:16.080> their<00:01:16.320> bodies

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
and athletes need to teach their bodies

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.770 
and athletes need to teach their bodies
to<00:01:16.770> surge<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.479> Vision

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to surge and one way we do it at Vision

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
to surge and one way we do it at Vision
Quest<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.470> focus<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.700> system

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Quest is we really focus on that system

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
Quest is we really focus on that system
and<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> intervals<00:01:22.049> between<00:01:22.229> 30<00:01:22.619> seconds

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and we do intervals between 30 seconds

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.120 
and we do intervals between 30 seconds
in<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:23.909> minutes<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.740> kind

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
in three minutes and if you really kind

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
in three minutes and if you really kind
of<00:01:26.189> hammer<00:01:26.460> down<00:01:26.700> even<00:01:26.970> further<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.600> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of hammer down even further on these on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.539 
of hammer down even further on these on

respond<00:01:39.240> their<00:01:39.450> body<00:01:39.600> can't<00:01:39.869> recover<00:01:40.170> because

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
respond their body can't recover because

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
respond their body can't recover because
they<00:01:40.860> never<00:01:41.009> necessarily<00:01:41.610> trained<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
they never necessarily trained it to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.700 
they never necessarily trained it to
recover<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.259> our<00:01:43.380> athletes

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
recover so what we do with our athletes

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.980 
recover so what we do with our athletes
is<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> focus<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.060> 30-second

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
is we really like to focus on 30-second

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
is we really like to focus on 30-second
intervals<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.979> hard<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.880> with

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
intervals as hard as they can go with

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
intervals as hard as they can go with
maybe<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> 2<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> 3<00:01:49.170> minute<00:01:49.350> rest<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.159> another

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
maybe a 2 to 3 minute rest that another

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.830 
maybe a 2 to 3 minute rest that another
30-second<00:01:51.030> interval<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.390> hard<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.750> can

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
30-second interval as hard as they can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
30-second interval as hard as they can
go<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> 2<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> 3<00:01:52.740> minute<00:01:52.890> rest<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.939> we

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
go with a 2 to 3 minute rest and then we

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
go with a 2 to 3 minute rest and then we
can<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.659> set<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> 10<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> those<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:56.189> cover<00:01:56.460> for

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
can do a set of 10 of those we cover for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
can do a set of 10 of those we cover for
maybe<00:01:56.820> 10<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.210> 12<00:01:57.390> minutes<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.170> another

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
maybe 10 or 12 minutes and do another

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
maybe 10 or 12 minutes and do another
side<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.860> those<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.280> 30<00:01:59.520> seconds<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.119> hard

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
side of those of 30 seconds really hard

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.410 
side of those of 30 seconds really hard
two<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.020> three<00:02:01.200> minutes<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.590> rest<00:02:02.240> once<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
two or three minutes of rest once the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
two or three minutes of rest once the
athlete<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.560> that'll<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.950> for

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
athlete is kind of what that'll do for

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.440 
athlete is kind of what that'll do for
the<00:02:05.250> athlete<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> couple<00:02:05.850> things<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.390> do

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the athlete a couple things if they do

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.990 
the athlete a couple things if they do
that<00:02:06.689> each<00:02:06.899> week<00:02:07.220> don't<00:02:08.220> start<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> figure<00:02:08.759> out

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that each week don't start to figure out

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
that each week don't start to figure out
what<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.140> search<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.649> 30<00:02:10.860> seconds<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
what they can search for 30 seconds I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.320 
what they can search for 30 seconds I
don't<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> give<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:11.970> exact

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
don't like to give them an exact

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.570 
don't like to give them an exact
power<00:02:12.510> number<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> lot<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.800> times<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.490> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
power number but a lot of times it's a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.890 
power number but a lot of times it's a
hundred<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.880> fifty<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.600> hundred<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
hundred and fifty to one hundred and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.840 
hundred and fifty to one hundred and
sixty<00:02:16.410> percent<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.920> their<00:02:17.100> threshold<00:02:17.550> number

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
sixty percent of their threshold number

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.300 
sixty percent of their threshold number
so<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.600> athlete<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:18.960> surge<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.470> 350<00:02:20.130> watts

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so if an athlete can surge at 350 watts

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580 
so if an athlete can surge at 350 watts
for<00:02:20.520> thirty<00:02:20.730> seconds<00:02:21.150> rest<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:21.960> maybe<00:02:22.200> 100

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
for thirty seconds rest at maybe 100

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
for thirty seconds rest at maybe 100
watts<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.400> three<00:02:23.550> minutes<00:02:23.670> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
watts for two or three minutes then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.800 
watts for two or three minutes then
surge<00:02:24.480> again<00:02:24.780> at<00:02:24.900> 350<00:02:25.620> watts<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.970> they<00:02:27.630> get

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
surge again at 350 watts as they get

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.540 
surge again at 350 watts as they get
better<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.170> better<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.950> I'll<00:02:29.130> start

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
better and better at that I'll start

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 
better and better at that I'll start
decreasing<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.690> recovery<00:02:31.050> so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
decreasing some of that recovery so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
decreasing some of that recovery so
maybe<00:02:31.770> instead<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.250> thirty<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:32.910> three

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
maybe instead of going thirty over three

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.300 
maybe instead of going thirty over three
minutes<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.600> go<00:02:33.990> thirty<00:02:34.320> minute<00:02:34.620> thirty<00:02:34.860> sorry

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
minutes I go thirty minute thirty sorry

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.590 
minutes I go thirty minute thirty sorry
thirty<00:02:35.520> Seconds<00:02:35.820> over<00:02:36.000> three<00:02:36.180> minutes<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> go

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
thirty Seconds over three minutes I go

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 
thirty Seconds over three minutes I go
thirty<00:02:36.840> Seconds<00:02:37.230> over<00:02:37.410> one<00:02:37.860> minute<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.340> thirty

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
thirty Seconds over one minute or thirty

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.430 
thirty Seconds over one minute or thirty
seconds<00:02:38.850> over<00:02:39.030> two<00:02:39.210> minutes<00:02:39.390> once<00:02:40.200> they<00:02:40.350> get

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
seconds over two minutes once they get

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.570 
seconds over two minutes once they get
pretty<00:02:40.710> good<00:02:40.770> at<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.460> hold

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
pretty good at that and they can hold

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.400 
pretty good at that and they can hold
those<00:02:41.760> numbers<00:02:42.090> even<00:02:42.180> better<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:43.020> sometimes

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
those numbers even better then sometimes

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.020 
those numbers even better then sometimes
they<00:02:43.470> even<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.710> thirty<00:02:44.010> Seconds<00:02:44.460> over<00:02:44.730> thirty

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
they even go thirty Seconds over thirty

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.850 
they even go thirty Seconds over thirty
seconds<00:02:45.510> which<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.630> more<00:02:45.990> like<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> race<00:02:46.590> pace

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
seconds which is more like a race pace

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.530 
seconds which is more like a race pace
effort<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.490> don't<00:02:47.910> necessarily<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.360> they

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
effort I don't necessarily think they

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
effort I don't necessarily think they
should<00:02:48.690> start<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.290> way<00:02:49.440> but<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.400> point

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
should start that way but at some point

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
should start that way but at some point
they<00:02:50.790> want<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.060> shorten<00:02:51.450> those<00:02:51.600> recoveries<00:02:52.170> up

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
they want to shorten those recoveries up

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.110 
they want to shorten those recoveries up
so<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.830> looks<00:02:52.860> more<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.430> they're<00:02:53.610> criterium

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
so it looks more like they're criterium

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.270 
so it looks more like they're criterium
their<00:02:54.450> group<00:02:54.660> under<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.959> races<00:02:55.440> an<00:02:55.920> even

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
their group under the races an even

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.710 
their group under the races an even
better<00:02:56.520> way<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> do<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.330> kind<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.570> look

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
better way to do it is to kind of look

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.380 
better way to do it is to kind of look
at<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.140> their<00:02:58.320> goal<00:02:58.560> race<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.400> look<00:03:00.270> at

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
at what their goal race is and look at

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.360 
at what their goal race is and look at
kind<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> power<00:03:00.900> file<00:03:01.260> from<00:03:01.530> from<00:03:01.860> from

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
kind of the power file from from from

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.580 
kind of the power file from from from
past<00:03:02.610> goal<00:03:02.940> races<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.480> figure<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.170> what<00:03:04.440> kind

with plenty of rest figuring out what

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.380 
with plenty of rest figuring out what
those<00:03:34.830> numbers<00:03:35.220> look<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.820> there's<00:03:36.180> two

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
those numbers look like and there's two

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.479 
those numbers look like and there's two
ways<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.600> improve<00:03:37.110> right<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.070> do<00:03:38.160> more<00:03:38.430> of

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
ways to improve right you can do more of

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.490 
ways to improve right you can do more of
those<00:03:38.670> numbers<00:03:39.090> at<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.300> consistent<00:03:39.840> power<00:03:39.989> or

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
those numbers at a consistent power or

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.890 
those numbers at a consistent power or
you<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:41.459> raise<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.820> overall<00:03:41.850> power<00:03:42.390> level<00:03:42.780> of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
you can raise the overall power level of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.710 
you can raise the overall power level of
of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.590> effort<00:03:43.860> itself<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:45.060> maintain<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
of the effort itself and maintain the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.570 
of the effort itself and maintain the
same<00:03:45.900> amount<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.290> intervals<00:03:46.620> either<00:03:47.100> way<00:03:47.370> is

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
same amount of intervals either way is

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.460 
same amount of intervals either way is
good<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:48.030> think<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.660> should<00:03:48.900> try<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> improve

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
good I think you should try to improve

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.050 
good I think you should try to improve
both<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.070> if<00:03:50.130> one<00:03:50.340> isn't<00:03:50.580> improving<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.030> much

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
both and if one isn't improving so much

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.240 
both and if one isn't improving so much
try<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.660> do<00:03:51.870> more<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.650> same<00:03:52.860> interval

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
try to do more of the same interval

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.740 
try to do more of the same interval
rather<00:03:53.670> than<00:03:53.820> increase<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.360> watts<00:03:54.570> each

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
rather than increase in the watts each

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.050 
rather than increase in the watts each
time
