00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.519
 that starts with a knot and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 hit air masses and use 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 we can do the multiplier 6 so you can 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 you, for example, calculate how 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 many have wanted or we beat the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.789
 mesh set 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.730
 We make sure that the mesh 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.730
 For example , we're happy with the count 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 123 45 and 66 stitches make one 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 mussel and then we count again from 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:01:03.379
 front 123456 is the second shell still 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:06.119
 times one two three four five and six 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.600
 that would be the chain for the shells and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.520
 so on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 depending on how long that should be and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 then we need that then we need it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.799
 12 more stitches with the pattern straight 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.700
 to be able to lay 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.460
 okay we start with one with one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 firm mesh so in the second stitch 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 from the hook a fortress 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.110
 now chopsticks and in the following 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 third stitch so how speaks 12 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.420
 the third machine chopsticks and 25 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 piece 1 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.130
 2 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.890
 3 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.430
 4 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 5, the shell, the shells works 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.070
 Of course, with three or four 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.659
 chopsticks just try it all out 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.080
 just shorten the chain a bit 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.520
 now have to skip the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.620
 the next two times already here can 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.620
 third mesh of a fixed breach 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.940
 jump two machines in the back 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:30.850
 and there are five in the third team 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.130
 chopsticks then again two stitches 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.940
 skip into the third one fixed 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.950
 skip machine with two people 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.950
 the third five chopsticks 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.920
 and in the last stitch a firm 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.920
 mesh 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.970
 I'm switching to another one now 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 so that the second row recognizes better 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.020
 that's just not true 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.690
 the second series we start - that was 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.959
 nicer the second row we start 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.230
 with an air wash then we turn 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:28.900
 the work and we are crocheting against the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 the first three mesh rod 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.680
 12 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.420
 and 3 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 that is half a shell we are on 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.810
 beginning of the series 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.640
 which is also in other races differently 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.650
 but look in the case because here 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.750
 before that the well was come here only 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.820
 a half slide in then 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.020
 Let's skip 12 stitches into the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.950
 moor third machine 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.930
 skip the next two people 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.670
 who knew it twice before 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.180
 already jumps into the third five 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 rod 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.359
 then two again skip the third 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.090
 one solid water and two again 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:31.960
 skip the third five sticks 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:36.070
 and again skip 1 2 in the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:48.150
 third a tight stitch and beware 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:48.150
 the last stitch only three sticks 2012 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:05.020
 Ok, that's how it looks 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.600
 that's a bit because I know it 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.260
 the waves must be in the case of mussel pattern 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.430
 always so kind that always 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.780
 it might even get better 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.120
 if we take a bigger hagen 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.940
 I would here yet yarn in which 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.580
 maybe be better 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.960
 down here the air mass would be me now 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.130
 in your place also a bit 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.560
 make it easier to find it now 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.970
 a bit too tight so it would 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.940
 I'll go one too 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.610
 your place the air masses still loose 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.310
 the bottom a bit wide yes 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.330
 the next row sometimes with the ghan 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.820
 continue because the pinkls has power 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.310
 An air of water turned the work 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.290
 around 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:55.720
 who a solid mesh and then five 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.570
 chopsticks so skip a two and 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.840
 five sticks in the third stitch so 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:09.240
 always look a bit so always in 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:13.390
 the wells where such a valley comes from 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.520
 there are always the 5 I stand 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.000
 Here is a problem especially with four too 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.130
 do 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.210
 maybe that works better 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.490
 is even quite so 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.890
 we have different here now 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.500
 again after the 5 2 leave out in the 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.420
 third a firm mass so on top 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:35.560
 the mountain the mooring in the valley the 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:39.700
 chopsticks and so on and so forth 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.850
 and so it turns out very simple 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.850
