try to micro them myself and I'm not
gonna<00:00:46.040> microwave<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.059> I'm<00:00:47.150> gonna<00:00:47.269> focus<00:00:47.479> down

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
gonna microwave but I'm gonna focus down

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.079 
gonna microwave but I'm gonna focus down
the<00:00:47.900> battle<00:00:48.170> cruisers<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.640> want<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.909> see<00:00:50.030> how

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
the battle cruisers so I want to see how

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.430 
the battle cruisers so I want to see how
this<00:00:50.150> goes<00:00:50.390> here<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:50.720> we're<00:00:50.960> gonna<00:00:51.080> have<00:00:51.229> three

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
this goes here so we're gonna have three

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.399 
this goes here so we're gonna have three
three<00:00:51.860> upgrades<00:00:52.570> which<00:00:53.570> means<00:00:53.839> I<00:00:53.989> have<00:00:54.140> six

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
three upgrades which means I have six

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.590 
three upgrades which means I have six
armor<00:00:54.769> which<00:00:54.979> I<00:00:55.190> believe<00:00:55.549> is<00:00:55.940> exactly<00:00:56.420> how

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
armor which I believe is exactly how

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.689 
armor which I believe is exactly how
much<00:00:56.750> damage<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.199> Marine<00:00:57.470> does<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.519> it's

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
much damage a Marine does so it's

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.090 
much damage a Marine does so it's
basically<00:00:59.119> like<00:00:59.239> less<00:01:00.080> than<00:01:00.290> one<00:01:00.500> damage<00:01:00.860> per

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
basically like less than one damage per

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.670 
basically like less than one damage per
shot<00:01:01.129> per<00:01:01.580> Marine<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:02.809> figured<00:01:03.260> seventy

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
shot per Marine so I figured seventy

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.200 
shot per Marine so I figured seventy
verse<00:01:03.830> three<00:01:04.159> should<00:01:04.369> be<00:01:04.460> about<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.820> right

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
verse three should be about the right

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.120 
verse three should be about the right
composition<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.200> make<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.470> as<00:01:06.560> close<00:01:06.830> as

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
composition to make it as close as

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.920 
composition to make it as close as
possible<00:01:07.190> we're<00:01:07.909> gonna<00:01:08.000> see<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.510> could<00:01:08.840> be

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
possible we're gonna see I could be

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.210 
possible we're gonna see I could be
completely<00:01:09.229> wrong<00:01:09.320> it's<00:01:09.650> gonna<00:01:09.740> be<00:01:09.830> one<00:01:10.010> side

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
completely wrong it's gonna be one side

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.440 
completely wrong it's gonna be one side
in<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.430> battle<00:01:10.580> cruisers<00:01:11.030> could<00:01:11.180> get<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.390> know

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
in the battle cruisers could get I know

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.170 
in the battle cruisers could get I know
annihilated<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:13.310> let's<00:01:13.640> give<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.850> shot<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
annihilated so let's give it a shot and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.010 
annihilated so let's give it a shot and
we'll<00:01:14.659> see<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.670> like<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.299> said<00:01:17.570> I'm<00:01:17.720> gonna<00:01:17.840> go

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
we'll see so like I said I'm gonna go

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.270 
we'll see so like I said I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.920> stamp

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
ahead and stamp

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.540 
ahead and stamp
get<00:01:21.760> everybody<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.150> there<00:01:23.100> focus<00:01:24.100> down<00:01:24.400> the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
get everybody in there focus down the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.360 
get everybody in there focus down the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
third everybody's hitting it good down

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.660 
third everybody's hitting it good down
to<00:01:49.090> 26<00:01:49.630> Marines<00:01:50.020> 25<00:01:50.710> now<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.340> stemmed

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
to 26 Marines 25 now I have stemmed

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
to 26 Marines 25 now I have stemmed
twice<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.770> let's<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.220> here

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
twice so let's see here

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.359 
twice so let's see here
19<00:01:57.280> 18<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:59.070> on<00:02:00.070> 200<00:02:00.670> life<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.860> 14

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
19 18 and then on 200 life down to 14

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.350 
19 18 and then on 200 life down to 14
Marines<00:02:03.960> 13<00:02:04.960> 12

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.420 

now<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:09.290> think<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.590> battlecruiser<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:10.250> going

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
now I think the battlecruiser is going

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.260 
now I think the battlecruiser is going
to<00:02:10.490> take<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.820> one<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.260> 70<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:13.100> three<00:02:13.610> even<00:02:14.060> if

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
to take this one so 70 on three even if

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.150 
to take this one so 70 on three even if
you<00:02:14.510> focused<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:15.230> battlecruiser<00:02:16.040> in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you focused on what battlecruiser in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.350 
you focused on what battlecruiser in
time<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.610> you're<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:16.760> spreading<00:02:17.150> out<00:02:17.300> your
