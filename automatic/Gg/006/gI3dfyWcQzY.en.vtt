00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.650
 a formidable pretext for some 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 start to start running the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.949

 My girl is called a tester that wakes up 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.820
 all the attackers that are thrown 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.059
 sent loose and that starts them 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.480

 Hello, the network today, which is Monday, the 18th 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 March 2013 my children tell them that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 a day like today but in the year 1965 the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 became the first man to walk 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.410
 for space 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.539
 Alex 6 was out for 12 minutes and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.540
 9 seconds attached to the ship by a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.820
 belt 5.35 meters 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.790
 of the walk the alexei costume 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.470
 had inflated in the vacuum of space 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.980
 to the point where I could not go back 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.290
 to enter the ship alexei had to open 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.140
 a valve to allow the pressure 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.120
 of the costume I would descend my children 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.330
 he says goodbye to me gods but here 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.810
 tomorrow remember that I am the blessed and that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.810
 you will always take me very, very deep inside 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.920
 I do not know why he was inflated so much that 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.710
 could not enter I do not have to press the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.299
 pivot then if I had two options or the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.100
 pivot or smear butter and 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.259
 then it was much more practical since 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.740
 being in space because April the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 pivot 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.990
 the butter was a little practical 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.289
 it was impractical so it was not the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.600
 hand because it was the hand but never the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.910
 butter thank you lady presents 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.380
