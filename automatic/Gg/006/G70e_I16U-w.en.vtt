00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.430 
i think is cheating to measure 72-foot
by<00:04:39.690> 160<00:04:40.650> feet<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:42.270> other<00:04:42.389> two<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:43.139> mere

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
by 160 feet and the other two of a mere

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.930 
by 160 feet and the other two of a mere
29<00:04:44.220> feet<00:04:44.639> high<00:04:44.910> by<00:04:45.389> 51<00:04:45.960> feet<00:04:46.320> wide<00:04:46.800> they're<00:04:47.639> so

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
29 feet high by 51 feet wide they're so

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
29 feet high by 51 feet wide they're so
huge<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.479> takes<00:04:48.720> ten<00:04:49.050> million<00:04:49.560> five<00:04:50.160> hundred

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
huge it takes ten million five hundred

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.810 
huge it takes ten million five hundred
eighty<00:04:51.830> 4064<00:04:52.880> LED<00:04:53.880> lights<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.780> make<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.229> shine

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
eighty 4064 LED lights to make it shine

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.670 
eighty 4064 LED lights to make it shine
so<00:04:56.820> presumably<00:04:57.120> we<00:04:57.780> can<00:04:57.930> also<00:04:58.080> expect<00:04:58.380> a

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
so presumably we can also expect a

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.659 
so presumably we can also expect a
record<00:04:58.979> for<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.160> world's<00:04:59.460> largest

that<00:05:35.729> idea<00:05:36.030> could<00:05:36.210> really<00:05:36.479> take<00:05:36.720> off<00:05:38.419> take<00:05:39.419> off

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
that idea could really take off take off
