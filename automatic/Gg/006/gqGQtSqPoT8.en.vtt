when<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> rip<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> mesh

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
when you when you want to rip a mesh

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.399 
when you when you want to rip a mesh
that's<00:01:25.250> taking<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.280> vertices<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.409> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that's taking the vertices and in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's taking the vertices and in
separating<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.659> handy<00:01:31.170> technique<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
separating it and a handy technique is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
separating it and a handy technique is
to<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.450> direction<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> you're

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to know the direction that you're

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.249 
to know the direction that you're
ripping<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.700> based<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:37.020> your

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
ripping and it's based off the way your

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.760 
ripping and it's based off the way your
mouse<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> I'll<00:01:39.960> right-click<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
mouse is so I'll right-click on that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.600 
mouse is so I'll right-click on that
virtus<00:01:41.570> okay<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.950> I'll<00:01:44.070> position<00:01:44.369> my

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
virtus okay and then I'll position my

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
virtus okay and then I'll position my
mouse<00:01:44.899> above<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.740> Firdous<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.430> around<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
mouse above this Firdous like around the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
mouse above this Firdous like around the
center<00:01:48.329> line<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.710> make<00:01:49.829> an

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
center line and I'm gonna make an

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.480 
center line and I'm gonna make an
upwards<00:01:50.399> movement<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> I'll<00:01:52.110> type<00:01:52.590> V<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> rip

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
upwards movement so I'll type V to rip

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
upwards movement so I'll type V to rip
and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.299> I'm<00:01:54.570> gonna<00:01:54.659> move<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> mouse<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.290> but

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and then I'm gonna move the mouse up but

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
and then I'm gonna move the mouse up but
the<00:01:55.649> mouse<00:01:55.799> position<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.430> important<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.689> this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the mouse position is important and this

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.130 
the mouse position is important and this
one

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
one

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.999 
one
I<00:02:01.170> mean<00:02:02.040> position<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
I mean position it down here and do the

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:12.809 
I mean position it down here and do the
move<00:02:05.009> down<00:02:06.890> here

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.399 

hey<00:02:13.819> that's<00:02:14.569> how<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.900> control<00:02:15.230> your

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
hey that's how you can control your

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.809

that<00:02:50.870> I'm<00:02:51.859> just<00:02:52.040> gonna<00:02:52.099> move<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.459> 3d<00:02:52.700> cursor

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
that I'm just gonna move the 3d cursor

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.430 
that I'm just gonna move the 3d cursor
for<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.329> second<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.190> rip<00:02:55.400> multiple

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
for a second you can rip multiple

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.440 
for a second you can rip multiple
vertices<00:02:57.440> at<00:02:57.709> once<00:02:57.920> I'll<00:02:58.250> go<00:02:58.400> Lee<00:02:58.760> rip<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
vertices at once I'll go Lee rip that

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.770 
vertices at once I'll go Lee rip that
open<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.760> here<00:03:04.970> I'm<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.239> gonna<00:03:05.329> close<00:03:05.569> this

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
open in here I'm just gonna close this

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.550 
open in here I'm just gonna close this
off<00:03:06.049> face<00:03:07.329> draw<00:03:08.329> our<00:03:09.280> clique<00:03:11.079> I'll<00:03:12.079> do<00:03:12.260> enter

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
off face draw our clique I'll do enter

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.430 
off face draw our clique I'll do enter
there<00:03:15.560> we<00:03:15.709> go<00:03:15.859> right<00:03:16.280> click<00:03:16.750> face<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:18.260> got<00:03:18.410> a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
there we go right click face we got a

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.349 
there we go right click face we got a
nice<00:03:18.650> quiet<00:03:19.010> over<00:03:19.430> there<00:03:19.459> cuz<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.150> 4

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
nice quiet over there cuz it's 4

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.150 
nice quiet over there cuz it's 4
vertices<00:03:20.720> even<00:03:21.530> though<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.739> looks<00:03:21.919> like<00:03:22.040> a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
vertices even though it looks like a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.430 
vertices even though it looks like a
triangle<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.700> little<00:03:23.060> bit<00:03:23.209> that's<00:03:23.569> right<00:03:23.840> it's

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
triangle a little bit that's right it's

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.800 
triangle a little bit that's right it's
actually<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:24.859> quad<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:25.910> in<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.329> diamond

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
actually a quad that's in a diamond

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.099 
actually a quad that's in a diamond
shape<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.880> you'll<00:03:28.880> notice<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.209> we<00:03:29.540> changed

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
shape and you'll notice that we changed

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.220 
shape and you'll notice that we changed
the<00:03:30.290> edge<00:03:30.410> flow<00:03:30.799> if<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.849> don't<00:03:32.060> control<00:03:32.419> our<00:03:32.540> it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the edge flow if I don't control our it

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.789 
the edge flow if I don't control our it
you<00:03:33.950> can<00:03:34.099> see<00:03:34.630> there's<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.690> little<00:03:35.840> loop<00:03:36.200> good

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
you can see there's a little loop good

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.830 
you can see there's a little loop good
look<00:03:37.010> there<00:03:37.280> there's<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.209> look<00:03:38.329> there

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
look there there's a look there

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.580 
look there there's a look there
this<00:03:39.470> goes<00:03:39.739> nice<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.069> straight<00:03:40.459> across<00:03:40.669> here

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
this goes nice and straight across here

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.470 
this goes nice and straight across here
these<00:03:42.590> are<00:03:42.769> still<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.299> was<00:03:44.419> able

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
these are still going up so I was able

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.059 
these are still going up so I was able
to<00:03:44.569> change<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> edge<00:03:45.169> flow<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:45.889> that's

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
to change the edge flow but that's

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.269 
to change the edge flow but that's
another<00:03:46.880> bit<00:03:48.310> we'll<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.519> next<00:03:49.609> time<00:03:49.849> bye
