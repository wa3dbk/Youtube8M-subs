00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I guess about an hour ago and as you can

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
I guess about an hour ago and as you can
see<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.770> brings<00:02:20.069> out<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> curls<00:02:20.760> oh

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
I'm doing pretty good there was a um a

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.619 
I'm doing pretty good there was a um a
spot<00:04:07.830> back<00:04:08.099> here<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.209> was<00:04:09.330> having

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
spot back here that was having

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.240 
spot back here that was having
difficulty<00:04:10.260> with<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:10.950> went<00:04:11.099> through

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
difficulty with so I just went through

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.899 
difficulty with so I just went through
it<00:04:11.549> very<00:04:11.580> gently<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:13.040> any<00:04:14.040> pieces<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.640> felt

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
it very gently and any pieces that felt

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.569 
it very gently and any pieces that felt
weird<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.390> me<00:04:15.689> I<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.560> went<00:04:16.859> ahead<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.519> just

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
weird to me I just went ahead and just

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180 
weird to me I just went ahead and just
snipped<00:04:18.090> off<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.570> end<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:19.440> I'm<00:04:19.949> not<00:04:20.009> too

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
snipped off the end of it so I'm not too

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.979 
snipped off the end of it so I'm not too
much<00:04:20.489> concerned<00:04:20.940> about<00:04:21.239> keeping<00:04:21.570> everything

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
much concerned about keeping everything

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.960 
much concerned about keeping everything
even<00:04:22.530> anymore

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
even anymore

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.280 
even anymore
because<00:04:23.090> my<00:04:23.210> hair<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.390> pretty<00:04:23.660> much<00:04:23.870> even<00:04:24.140> for

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
because my hair is pretty much even for

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.020 
because my hair is pretty much even for
the<00:04:24.470> most<00:04:24.590> part<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:25.010> know<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.430> probably<00:04:25.460> kind<00:04:25.880> of

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
the most part I know it probably kind of

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.930 
the most part I know it probably kind of
looks<00:04:26.210> like<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.480> asymmetrical<00:04:27.350> haircut<00:04:28.070> but

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
looks like a asymmetrical haircut but

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.360 
looks like a asymmetrical haircut but
it's<00:04:29.180> just<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.480> my<00:04:29.660> hair<00:04:30.260> pattern<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.920> looser

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
it's just that my hair pattern is looser

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.590 
it's just that my hair pattern is looser
in<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.550> front<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:31.970> tighter<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.450> back

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
in the front and tighter in the back

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.630 
in the front and tighter in the back
that's<00:04:32.780> why<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.050> looks<00:04:33.110> like<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:34.160> anyway

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
that's why it looks like that but anyway

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.770 
that's why it looks like that but anyway
let<00:04:34.790> me<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:35.030> turn<00:04:35.180> around<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.510> show<00:04:35.690> you
