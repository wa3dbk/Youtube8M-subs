doing really quick remaining it says the
smoke<00:00:09.030> goes<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.840> fax<00:00:10.260> or<00:00:10.650> goes<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
smoke goes up and fax or goes up the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.030 
smoke goes up and fax or goes up the
flute<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.080> doing<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.740> built

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
flute and so what are you doing we built

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.410 
flute and so what are you doing we built
this<00:00:14.250> thing<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> take

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
this thing which I'm not going to take

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.439 
this thing which I'm not going to take
out<00:00:15.599> again<00:00:15.980> but<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.190> angled<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
out again but it's angled because the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.050 
out again but it's angled because the
hole<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.660> right<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.260> though<00:00:19.490> it<00:00:20.490> did<00:00:20.640> angles

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
hole is right here though it did angles

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.230 
hole is right here though it did angles
the<00:00:21.210> smoke<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> goes<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the smoke so it goes to the back of the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
the smoke so it goes to the back of the
original<00:00:25.019> fire<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> smoke<00:00:26.640> guide

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
original fire so it's like a smoke guide

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
original fire so it's like a smoke guide
or<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> flu<00:00:28.050> guide<00:00:28.380> sometimes<00:00:29.189> where<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> hole

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
or a flu guide sometimes where the hole

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840 
or a flu guide sometimes where the hole
directly<00:00:30.150> comes<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.830> about<00:00:31.830> six<00:00:32.250> inches<00:00:32.520> off

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
directly comes up about six inches off

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.869 
directly comes up about six inches off
and<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:33.719> doing<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.250> tack<00:00:35.250> welding
