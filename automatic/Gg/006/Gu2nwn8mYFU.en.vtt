we<00:01:28.770> added<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.189> pins<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.700> blue<00:01:29.880> went<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
we added the two pins the blue went to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.319 
we added the two pins the blue went to
14<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.990> black<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> 15<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> piece

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
14 the black one to 15 and on this piece

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
14 the black one to 15 and on this piece
it<00:01:33.479> has<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.320> twisted<00:01:34.740> harness<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it has the twisted harness right here so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.999 
it has the twisted harness right here so
the<00:01:35.520> purple<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> blue

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
the purple is going to go to the blue

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.200 
the purple is going to go to the blue
the<00:01:38.009> white<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> black

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the white is going to go to the black

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
the white is going to go to the black
and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.810> our<00:01:39.960> camera<00:01:40.170> triggers<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and then we have our camera triggers and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.249 
and then we have our camera triggers and
our<00:01:41.070> video<00:01:41.430> input<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.659> basically<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.140> what

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
our video input so basically now what

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.240 
our video input so basically now what
we're<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.890> we're<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> take

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
we're going to do is we're going to take
this<00:01:44.490> piece<00:01:44.899> we're<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> slide<00:01:46.290> this

going to program I'm just going to walk

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.290 
going to program I'm just going to walk
through<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.320> program<00:02:13.650> real<00:02:13.860> quick<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.970> basic

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
through the program real quick the basic

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.860 
through the program real quick the basic
first<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> do<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.020> find<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> obd2<00:02:17.870> which

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
first one to do is find the obd2 which

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.840 
first one to do is find the obd2 which
we're<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
we're going to do and we have the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.580 
we're going to do and we have the
program<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> module<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> program<00:02:22.230> module

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
program you module the program module

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.050 
program you module the program module
program<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.190> VM<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.730> only<00:02:23.820> going<00:02:23.970> on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
program so the VM so it's only going on

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
program so the VM so it's only going on
one<00:02:24.180> vehicle<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.660> can't<00:02:24.990> keep<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
one vehicle you just can't keep it and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.050 
one vehicle you just can't keep it and
use<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.520> several<00:02:26.670> other<00:02:26.820> vehicles

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
use it for several other vehicles

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
use it for several other vehicles
there's<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> OEM<00:02:27.810> programmer<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.830> main

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
there's the OEM programmer the main

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560 
there's the OEM programmer the main
thing<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.610> wire<00:02:29.850> when<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.180> connect<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
thing is this wire when you connect it

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.199 
thing is this wire when you connect it
to<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.650> unprogrammed<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:33.060> for

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
to this one is for unprogrammed but for

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.080 
to this one is for unprogrammed but for
programming<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:33.870> connect<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.000> have

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
programming don't connect it so we have

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.240 
programming don't connect it so we have
the<00:02:36.180> program<00:02:36.480> instructions<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.470> make

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the program instructions right here make

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.350 
the program instructions right here make

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
sure that the blue wires are not

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
sure that the blue wires are not
connected<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.050> we<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.350> checked<00:02:40.620> we're

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
connected like we just checked we're

teeny opposition to the obd2 plug so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.290 
teeny opposition to the obd2 plug so
we're<00:02:48.570> going<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> plug<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.680> obd2<00:02:50.300> just

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
we're going to plug it in the obd2 just

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.600 
we're going to plug it in the obd2 just
like<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.100> plugged<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.459> it's

restart approximately in 20 seconds so
there<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.930> run<00:03:13.080> screen

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.520 

so<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.270> been<00:03:38.360> about<00:03:38.510> 20<00:03:38.810> seconds<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.380> looks

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
so it's been about 20 seconds it looks

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.070 
so it's been about 20 seconds it looks
like<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.770> screen<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:41.330> coming<00:03:41.600> up

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
like the screen is coming up

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.580 
like the screen is coming up
let's<00:03:42.230> see<00:03:43.960> performing<00:03:44.960> maintenance<00:03:45.110> so

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
let's see performing maintenance so

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.010 
let's see performing maintenance so
we're<00:03:45.890> in<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.220> right<00:03:46.720> position<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.750> we're

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
we're in the right position so we're

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.630 
we're in the right position so we're
going<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.200> wait<00:03:48.350> for<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.710> screen<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.220> reset

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
going to wait for the screen to reset

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.580 
going to wait for the screen to reset
and<00:03:49.910> then<00:03:50.540> pop<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.050> see<00:03:51.140> if<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> reverse

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
and then pop it and see if a reverse

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.000 
and then pop it and see if a reverse
paint<00:03:51.890> comes<00:03:52.130> up

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.640

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
let's put in Reverse and see what we

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.640 
let's put in Reverse and see what we
have<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:37.750> one<00:04:38.750> thing<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.960> make<00:04:39.170> sure<00:04:39.410> when

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
we're at this point you're in Reverse

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.450 
we're at this point you're in Reverse
and<00:04:41.330> if<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:41.450> don't<00:04:41.600> get<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.750> picture<00:04:42.370> take<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
reverse comes on so obviously there's a
