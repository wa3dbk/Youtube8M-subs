and then if you look in the very bottom
in<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:51.020> middle<00:04:51.289> doing<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> piece<00:04:51.979> down<00:04:52.220> here

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
in the middle doing the piece down here

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.210 
in the middle doing the piece down here
there's<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:53.960> little<00:04:54.220> indentation

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
there's I get that little indentation

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.810 
there's I get that little indentation
slot<00:04:55.930> that's<00:04:56.930> where<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:58.039> piece<00:04:58.370> needs<00:04:58.669> to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
slot that's where this piece needs to

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.680 
slot that's where this piece needs to
slide<00:04:59.120> all<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.390> way<00:04:59.539> into<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:02.120> make<00:05:02.510> sure
