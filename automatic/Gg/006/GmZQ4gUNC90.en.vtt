00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you know what to be honest you would

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
you know what to be honest you would
think<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> hard

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
think that they would be kind of hard

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
think that they would be kind of hard
because<00:01:33.180> they're<00:01:33.479> candy<00:01:33.720> canes<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.439> her<00:01:34.650> legs

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
because they're candy canes but her legs

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
because they're candy canes but her legs
are<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.369> super<00:01:36.180> super<00:01:36.630> rubbery<00:01:37.110> bendy
