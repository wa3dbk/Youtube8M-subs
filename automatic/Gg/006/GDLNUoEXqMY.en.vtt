00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi girls today i would like to show a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.879
 Some of the things I've taken lately is 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.069
 here with me it's a bit of a mix there are some 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 clothes some tricks a mix of things and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.330
 this beautiful shirt would start 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 that I took from Zara and as soon as I got it 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.740
 view just crazy now you will understand the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.199
 because it seems made for me 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.230
 because above you draw lips and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.990
 lipsticks and I also have all 7 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 these really nice beads yes but 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.859
 I think it is very very pretty and ve 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.009
 I said they went crazy as soon as 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.930
 I saw it lastras between gold and then 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 always from zara but not in the shop 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 because I called I asked and it is me 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.100
 It has been said that they only come to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.230
 milan to turin seems to me the anthem 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 of Italy and therefore I took nothing on them 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 line on their online site however they are 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.670
 I quickly got there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 got these boots and I'll explain to you now 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 because I'm a little bit skeptical 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.820
 at the beginning nobody knew so much that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.010
 I'm looking for simple politi boots 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.879
 above the knee and all the years of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.829
 cercola 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 but exactly as I would like and have seen 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 I didn't see these on the site 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.619
 live and they looked beautiful to me 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 I fell in love with him 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 then I took them and when I got them 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.590
 arrived I was skeptical because it was engraved 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 I liked them a lot 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 instead without gen about a child because yes 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.990
 they approach, however, I show them to you 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 because I think they are really a lot 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 very beautiful are these penalties will 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 can over the knee I am very much 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 very long they do not have a heel 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.070
 particularly high you see they don't have 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.020
 Plato have nothing at all even 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 because already the boot that arrives above 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.189
 the knee is more aggressive aggressive 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.860
 holy act 15 and the plateau becomes much 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.750
 difficult to carry and these are not 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.729
 very close this is the thing that a little 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.070
 leaves me perplexed because on the leg 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 they do not remain very close we say that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 they are close-fitting if worn over the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 pants if I didn't know one instead 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.220
 woman fall a little bit 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 but I have to say that I like them too 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.880
 so at the beginning I thought a little undecided 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.729
 of heroin chat and keep them o 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.439
 return them right at the end worn 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.420
 I saw him worn according to mendoza 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.100
 which are really beautiful after that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.040
 at the supermarket got this pizza is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.329
 this in the 5.0 color cassano that is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.200
 what I did now that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.300
 practically my natural color 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.069
 and last we did the shatush the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.080
 got everything was real all been 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.760
 also all September and then in the end me 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.230
 I'm tired he said ok let's copy it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.519
 shatush only that covered with a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 lighter color than a cure column 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.819
 of hair and then you could see the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.470
 regrowth in the thing I hate those 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.760
 eight ok takes a tint of mine 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.459
 color so I do it then I do 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.810
 grow my hair without having to do 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.120
 tut sutil is already leaving mine 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 natural color and among other things I took it 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.690
 at the supermarket and I asked for advice 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 to the other girl making the video 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.099
 question that surely you always know 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.500
 all are cut away marta daniela sailing 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.209
 I greet all of you, but bye guys and thanks for 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.860
 the writing from sugo lsap because we are in 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.840
 a group all together and I wrote 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.989
 desperate type help or I have to take the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 castle the dark brown I have to take it 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.010
 5.0 4.0 the 6 in short heroine 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.150
 very decisive and they helped me and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.130
 among other things, my notice to take the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.989
 brown and not dark brown because 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 therefore they tend to color a lot 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.590
 calculated that I took the brown is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.120
 really came out a very dark cassano 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.090
 that is, if you take the dark brown you come out 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.739
 I practically liked honey 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 found pretty and the pencil I feel 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.030
 so I could say it's not going to do 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.889
 the comparison with the other colors here 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.760
 inside there is this balm who he is 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.470
 great and I'm 54 ml so I think 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.700
 that last me for a while and I liked the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
 found very very nice leaves i 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.420
 hair really soft and bright 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.859
 so I liked that very common 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.720
 always at the supermarket caught these 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.190
 four single-dose and alien masks 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.139
 they only deserve single doses for that last 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.150
 different applications and I really like it 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.489
 this format of masks also because 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.139
 therefore they end immediately if first 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.690
 we do not like a thing there remains the 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.069
 jar or giant to finish I said to myself 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.209
 I like them very much for this reason too 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.700
 because there are so many types 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.040
 different so not on the possible 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.709
 change and find different ones and I have 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.450
 took this 2 of the cache and this is the 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.859
 purifying clay mask because 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.230
 you know that I'm always looking for 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.720
 something purifying for my skin 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.459
 and then I got this pack for the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.069
 eye contour to the extract of 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.260
 cornflower always of the ark was then ho 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.730
 got this mask filÃ²s you have 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.530
 present the transparent one that comes 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.079
 away that it seems practically a way that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.389
 torn which therefore also acts as pines and 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.299
 then this is also the largest 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.380
 the heavier is the clay 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.790
 certifications and this is also the only one 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.860
 I really enjoyed it 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.350
 so much from my house I took these two 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.090
 lakers lakers and I love is 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.980
 really the most comfortable thing in the world 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.050
 in winter and then wear a pair of 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.390
 leggings with beautiful heavy drawers 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.430
 that keep a big sweater warm 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.780
 extra large gardini then at the hips 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.820
 just to cover a little because also 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.220
 she of a cover, much less indeed 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.950
 an xtra sweater covers nothing here 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.270
 a beautiful scarf is a warm wow 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.710
 I think they are the maximum of 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.510
 community and since I discovered i 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.590
 lakers I hardly mind reaching are 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.530
 especially for every day too 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.850
 because I find it much much more comfortable and 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.190
 I get these two pair of leggins 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.180
 I took these here that are black and are 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.340
 damask and this I have already worn 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.590
 and then I took this pair of leggins of 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.810
 skin and we never took the lakers 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.580
 of skin also because I always am 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.770
 liked among ever seen a little bit 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.350
 too aggressive for my style 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.150
 at least poppins go well if you 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.270
 think of a couple of leggins like these 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.400
 pdl combined with a low or low boot 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.680
 a mega sweater a sweatshirt are not then 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.450
 so aggressive sure then if 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.220
 match with the one heeled shoe 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.620
 cute shirt a tina shirt that 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.880
 become more aggressive are cute 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.010
 so I think they are very versatile 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.810
 theaters day as I said before with a 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.330
 mega maioli young with a low shoe 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.010
 but also for the evening with a 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.770
 little queen clothing more in the evening 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.229
 and these are the ones here are very simple of 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.740
 faux leather are elasticized and have 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.330
 little bags on the back of America here 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.250
 to show these two be nice 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.560
 and these averages taken away this summer 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.070
 the thousand meters that among other things there is a 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.479
 v 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.860

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.810
 leaf this is the number 25 pink tank that 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.520
 it is a beautiful fuchsia in pink and fuchsia 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.020
 this is not the case though 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.150
 linea has arrived in italy however it does 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.560
 part of that line a little bit more 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 there are a lot of moisturizing here 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.370
 curious to try this above all 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.080
 to see how short they are a lot 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.060
 curious to see these new ones 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.090
 blitz and I hope I like them a lot 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.440

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.400
 I adore and nothing so this all 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.199
 purchases I made in the last one 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.490
 period let me know if you have taken 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.040
 something but if there is something I do 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.080
 recommended to watch or to take 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.870
 among the few if the new naked la comes out 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.880

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.990
 nothing mimicking a huge kiss and there 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.100
 let's go next video bye 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.330

 yesterday we are now at the fifth 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.479
 season and I have never been a person 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.479
 episodes of the vampire diaries
