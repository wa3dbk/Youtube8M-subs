00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello everyone with you and it's 18 bye 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 she will tell you about the team today 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 test 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.940
 but before moving on to the team itself and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.730
 I would like to say that if we write 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.150
 We put this command into a block 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.769
 Tatar Tatars successful execution 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 commands on the comparators will signal 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 An example of me now is the effect 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 damage resistance this command block 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.860
 she takes away i press the effect disappears 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.329
 and there is a signal lamp now on 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.160
 let's try the effect again 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.020
 what thread and no why take it away 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 impossible and therefore the signal disappears 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 Well, let me show you what you can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 done with the command, you can dispute 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.739
 determine where the player is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 how do you know the lamp is on if the stop 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 I won't talk to you here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.560
 if I get up on it there were lamps for 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 of this we write test for 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 a dog and well or whatever it is a balm and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.869
 meaning, but here it is the most convenient further 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 square brackets and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 coordinates here all these z equals y equals x 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 equally you can omit i just write 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.369
 coordinates separated by commas but I decided them 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 use this tutorial further write 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 comma fish 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 radius, that is, the coordinate of this one 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.649
 block and radius 1 that is, everything will be 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 born 1st block namely these 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.300
 Naturally only to let 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.690
 go here click on the button itself pop 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.539
 goes well now done differently like 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.539
 you have a warm up you know again 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:59.880
 for if on the stage here's these for one of 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.829
 of these four you will drive you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.130
 To do this, specify the minimum radius 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.060
 equal to one that is from 1 to 1 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.840
 range from this project accordingly 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.840
 the block itself does not accept all this smashing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 taken into account 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.989
 the next is the radius in the form of such a number 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.950
 65536 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.860
 what kind of number is it allows 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.750
 specify the radius exactly within 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.670
 this block that is to standard here 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:43.049
 the beginning and here's the radius indicated go away 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.030
 bit of a block that is radius when 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.030
 stream with basking now presents 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 dude can also determine how much u 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.010
 player's number of team points 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.319
 will be about me to collect it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:11.290
 called display name 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:13.879
 crossover and vnut if there is from 1 to 1 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.900
 as you can see it needs to 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.730
 write score 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.139
 underscore with and no matter what 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.329
 and then on should only at the end 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.939
 flood underscore had that is 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.310
 the least you are here if you are struggling to fall 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.799
 shaft groove for face 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.120
 let's coffin nothing happens 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:38.299
 make the 1st and the lamp 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.269
 let's try again so we 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.109
 believed now turn off again click 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.109
 the lamp has gone out 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.550
 then I forgot to wean in general the following 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.090
 it can be determined which team 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.840
 there is a game for this we write tim 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.440
 washed the title of connor rockfall and see 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.270
 if i press enable and say if 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.690
 I retreat to the team this can be noticed by 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.290
 change the color of nickname see green 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.440
 green green i'm on the team so here 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.640
 push the lamp is on 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.870
 we quit a command the lamp does not press and 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.270
 the last need to determine the amount 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.340
 you experience the player to write this l 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:32.890
 that is, rather than experience level 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.480
 write down are limited from you review and 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.420
 number of role levels separated by commas 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.150
 Alma, that is, the minimum you know will be 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.460
 range from this to this in general 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.680
 me from 1 to 1 of 1 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.480
 let's try nothing happens 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.580
 I use 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:58.960
 talk to you as you see me 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.970
 the amount of level 1 well in general is all 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.450
 what I wanted to tell you about the test team 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.820
 for like if you like 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.710
 write comments subscribe to 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.170
 channel wait for new videos as well as if 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.330
 want to know how something is done with 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.440
 using the block command, write it in 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.440
