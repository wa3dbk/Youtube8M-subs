00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
opposed to just hitting the roof and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.380 
opposed to just hitting the roof and
going<00:01:00.440> into<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.739> sewer<00:01:00.950> system<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.030> have

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
going into the sewer system so you have

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.469 
going into the sewer system so you have
the<00:01:02.660> cooling<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.860> summertime<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.000> extra

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
the cooling in the summertime the extra

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.480 
the cooling in the summertime the extra

urban heat island effect and then also

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.510 
urban heat island effect and then also
increase<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.610> green<00:01:11.000> space<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.369> just

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
increase in green space and this is just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.760 
increase in green space and this is just
one<00:01:13.640> half<00:01:14.149> of<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:14.420> building<00:01:14.869> right<00:01:15.110> so

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
one half of this building right so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.490 
one half of this building right so
what's<00:01:15.979> going<00:01:16.220> on<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.670> group

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
what's going on in the group

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.170 
what's going on in the group
sure<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.280> building<00:01:19.580> we're<00:01:19.820> standing

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
sure this is the building we're standing

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.360 
sure this is the building we're standing
on<00:01:20.300> houses<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.140> City<00:01:21.410> Hall<00:01:21.620> side<00:01:22.190> of

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
on houses the City Hall side of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.710 
on houses the City Hall side of
government<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:22.940> then<00:01:23.090> also<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.540> cliq

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
government and then also the cliq

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.870 
government and then also the cliq
counties<00:01:24.080> are<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.320> government<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:24.980> Cook

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
counties are the government and the Cook

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.820 
counties are the government and the Cook
County<00:01:25.910> side<00:01:26.420> still<00:01:26.750> has<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.960> black<00:01:27.320> tar<00:01:27.620> roof

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
County side still has a black tar roof

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.800 
County side still has a black tar roof
and<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.910> first<00:01:29.180> green<00:01:29.480> roof<00:01:29.660> in

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and so this is the first green roof in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.780 
and so this is the first green roof in
the<00:01:29.840> city<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.170> Chicago<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.430> did<00:01:31.610> it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
the city of Chicago and what it did it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.370 
the city of Chicago and what it did it
gave<00:01:31.940> us<00:01:32.090> an<00:01:32.210> opportunity<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.780> do<00:01:33.080> some

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
gave us an opportunity to do some

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.320 
gave us an opportunity to do some
measurements<00:01:34.310> as<00:01:34.580> far<00:01:34.790> as<00:01:34.880> temperature

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
measurements as far as temperature

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.840 
measurements as far as temperature
differential<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.230> what<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.890> found<00:01:37.160> is<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.490> on

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
differential so what we found is that on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.480 
differential so what we found is that on
a<00:01:37.880> hot<00:01:38.240> summer<00:01:38.600> day<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.470> ambience<00:01:39.950> or<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.340> air

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
a hot summer day the ambience or the air

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.520 
a hot summer day the ambience or the air
temperature<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.120> on<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.750> side<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.200> City<00:01:42.440> Hall

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
temperature on on this side of City Hall

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.800 
temperature on on this side of City Hall
versus<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> county<00:01:43.970> side<00:01:44.150> of<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.420> building

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
versus the county side of the building

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.950 
versus the county side of the building
is<00:01:44.960> 80<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.920> 90<00:01:46.280> degrees<00:01:46.400> cooler<00:01:46.940> on<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.600> city

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
is 80 to 90 degrees cooler on the city

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.930 
is 80 to 90 degrees cooler on the city
hall<00:01:48.200> side<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.710> building<00:01:49.070> wow<00:01:49.580> that's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
hall side of the building wow that's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.359 
hall side of the building wow that's
great<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.660> after<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.619> grievances<00:01:52.160> put

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
great and so after this grievances put

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.550 
great and so after this grievances put
in<00:01:52.520> there's<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.119> lot<00:01:53.210> more<00:01:53.420> now<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.080> city<00:01:54.380> so
