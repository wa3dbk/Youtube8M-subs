00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
explain it we've got this extraordinary

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.550 
explain it we've got this extraordinary
iron<00:01:44.549> sword<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> power<00:01:45.570> level<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.140> 40

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
iron sword which has a power level of 40

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.780 
iron sword which has a power level of 40
damage<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> 15<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:49.229> health<00:01:49.530> points<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.250> 19

damage is 15 and the health points is 19

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.139 
damage is 15 and the health points is 19
point<00:01:51.119> 1<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.310> power<00:01:53.490> level<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
point 1 so if we are the power level of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.510 
point 1 so if we are the power level of
67<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.409> obviously<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> best

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
67 now and obviously that's not the best

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.209 
67 now and obviously that's not the best
we<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> power<00:01:57.630> level<00:01:58.009> we<00:01:59.009> can

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
we can have for the power level we can

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.639 
we can have for the power level we can
press<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.549> right<00:02:00.119> click<00:02:00.329> button<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.590> will

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
press the right click button and it will

send that sort in through the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.040 
send that sort in through the
and<00:02:04.740> center<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.480> see<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.930> will

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
and center so as you can see it will

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.950 
and center so as you can see it will
change<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.560> power<00:02:07.770> level<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.310> 67<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.660> damage

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
change the power level to 67 the damage

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.830 
change the power level to 67 the damage
will<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.590> twenty<00:02:10.979> six<00:02:11.160> point<00:02:11.490> six

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
will go up to twenty six point six

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
will go up to twenty six point six
rather<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:13.200> fifteen<00:02:14.160> point<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
rather than fifteen point three and the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720 
rather than fifteen point three and the
health<00:02:15.900> points<00:02:16.260> will<00:02:16.440> double<00:02:16.740> again<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
health points will double again so and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.850 
health points will double again so and
all<00:02:17.910> these<00:02:18.060> other<00:02:18.300> stats<00:02:18.600> go<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.710> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
all these other stats go up but as you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.320 
all these other stats go up but as you
can<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> costs<00:02:20.670> eight<00:02:20.850> hundred<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
can see it costs eight hundred and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
can see it costs eight hundred and
thirty<00:02:21.600> two<00:02:21.690> platinum<00:02:22.500> coins<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.490> I

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
thirty two platinum coins and then if I

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
thirty two platinum coins and then if I
place<00:02:23.820> adapt<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.390> won't<00:02:24.540> work<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
place adapt it won't work but it's a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.860 
place adapt it won't work but it's a
really<00:02:26.100> good<00:02:26.250> thing<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.090> can't<00:02:27.420> find<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
really good thing if you can't find a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.970 
really good thing if you can't find a
sword<00:02:28.110> better<00:02:28.410> than<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.760> you've<00:02:29.910> got<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.980> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to be on my light my lamp which is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640 
to be on my light my lamp which is
actually<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> same<00:03:05.430> seed<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.300> as<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.530> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
actually in the same seed but as you can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.320 
actually in the same seed but as you can
see<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:08.400> lights<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:08.850> room<00:03:09.180> but
