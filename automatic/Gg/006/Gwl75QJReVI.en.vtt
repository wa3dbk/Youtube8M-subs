00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.139

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.510

 the more intense the front runs 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.189
 and the more lively the deer roars 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.189
 on warm nights, on the other hand, you hardly hear anything 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.219
 every strong deer the so-called top dog he has a lot to do he 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.030

 but above all, the younger or weaker rival must be in his 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.849
 Haaren argue repeatedly and distribute them by showiness 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.849
 and deter disturbances 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.589

 the dams almost always lay their calves in some hiding place 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.989
