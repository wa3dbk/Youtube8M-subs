00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 John Deere continues the revolution of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.180
 6th in presenting the transmission 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.310
 direct dream 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.680
 previously grounded luxury vehicles 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.770
 and is equipped with double technology 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.770
 clutch 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.190
 with drive gives you a better 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.470
 driving comfort an acceleration 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.470
 faster and unique are efficiency 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.400
 So much for the theory but what about 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.400
 reality 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.760
 it's john deere before 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 production of a new series of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 tractors these pass tests of 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.280
 pre-production 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.110
 only products of which we are 100% 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.790
 satisfied not happen this step 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 we want to be absolutely sure of 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.160
 manufacture and deliver the best known 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.859
 that's why the new generation of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 tractors and tested by real 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 farmers and laborers in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.660
 actual conditions or during tests of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660
 pre-production 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 customers have to test the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.430
 tractor under the same conditions 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.660
 of use plus their own tractor 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.070
 we mainly use the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.440
 tractor for operations of 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.660
 transport corn herbs then we go out 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 the manure is the substrate the zone of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.600
 radiation for transport routes 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 for the companies where we work 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.580
 is about 80 km at the request of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.800
 customers have cover between 3 to 15 km 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 our first impression of the tractor 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.130
 we are very very pleasantly 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
 surprised and he moves almost like 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.430
 a continuously variable tractor 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.150
 shifting is barely 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.860
 perceptible 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 in other words we are very 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 pleasantly surprised 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 we mainly use the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.720
 tractors for the operations of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.630
 transport between 5 and 10 km sometimes a 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.189
 little more we use 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.200
 mainly tractors for 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.320
 heavy operations for twelve to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.179
 fifteen hours a day the transmission 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.069
 is very nice and the passage of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.840
 speeds is fast 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.849
 the gear change goes unnoticed 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.580
 and there is absolutely no loss of 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.930
 power even if one passes them 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.670
 automatic speeds manually 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.680
 it is possible to switch to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
 automatic shifting is 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
 very fast it's a non 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.920
 positive in all respects the tractor and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.840
 comfortable I do not want to say that I 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.440
 been very pleasantly surprised by the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250
 transmission 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.250
 we hamm is always 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.099
 we tried the caterer during 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.680
 fifteen days for the edge and the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.360
 transportation of silos and winter barley 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.769
 we enjoyed the comfort 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.819
 driving a transmission to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.410
 continuous variation 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.500
 coupled with the power that a 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.480
 manual transmission we calculated 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 the yield of the tractor per liter bench 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 in plowing the transport of silos 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.360
 and concluded that the consumption of diesel 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 is less than that of a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.379
 manual transmission 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.269
 we are extremely satisfied with this 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.400
 tractor in terms of comfort and 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.849
 transmission it's a tractor that we 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.849
 would choose 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 in other words, direct transmission 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.709
 drive has lived up to expectations 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.060
 during pre-production tests 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.010
 do you want more information about 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.420
 pre production tests john dip 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.420
 so stay tuned 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.040
 the linkage allows us to observe 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 at any time our actor here at 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.410
 mannheim so during the pre tests 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 production an unusual element is 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.990
 detected for a dealer reports 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 a problem 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.570
 the working group reacts 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.570
 at once 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.560
 we analyze the problem and we 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 let's see if it can be solved remotely 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.989
 also a team of engineers must 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.989
 move 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.760
 in this way the tractor is 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.760
 quickly delivered or codes 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.159
 the program of production of garlic rec 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.780
 brief is one of the many tests that 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.239
 john deere performed on a new 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.530
 tractor because we take your 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.690
 requirements very seriously 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.690
 all new products post and is 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.740
 in our factories but also to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.200
 outside whose shows in conditions 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.260
 real and difficult tested by real 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.880
 agricultural water farmers 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.190
 in order to actually receive what you 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.440
 expect the best quality standards 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.450
 and reliability 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.090
 the direct drive drive john deere 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.090
 the six-area revolution continues
