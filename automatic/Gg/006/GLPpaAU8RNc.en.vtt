point of this video is that I want to
stress<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.050> keyboard<00:00:34.500> itself

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
stress that the keyboard itself

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
stress that the keyboard itself
especially<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.850> gaming<00:00:36.270> should<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.960> your

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
especially for gaming should be your

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
especially for gaming should be your
least<00:00:37.530> concern<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.670> least

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
least concern or should be your least

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
least concern or should be your least
priority<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> comes<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.079> getting<00:00:40.620> better

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
priority when it comes to getting better

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
priority when it comes to getting better
gear<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.520> gaming<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.050> only

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
gear for gaming and this is from my only

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.690 
gear for gaming and this is from my only
personal<00:00:43.680> experience<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.280> find<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
personal experience I just find the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
personal experience I just find the
keyboard<00:00:44.879> does<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
keyboard does not make much of a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
keyboard does not make much of a
difference<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.010> any<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> comes

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
difference if any at all when it comes

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
difference if any at all when it comes
to<00:00:48.989> actual<00:00:49.320> games<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> PC<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:51.329> makes<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to actual games on the PC what makes the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
to actual games on the PC what makes the
most<00:00:51.899> difference<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:52.980> opinion<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
most difference in my opinion is your

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
most difference in my opinion is your
mouse<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.170> monitor<00:00:55.559> these<00:00:55.739> are

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
gaming peripherals here we're not

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
gaming peripherals here we're not
talking<00:00:57.660> obviously<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.410> graphics<00:00:58.829> card<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
talking obviously your graphics card and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
talking obviously your graphics card and
your<00:00:59.430> CPU<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.570> stuff<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.199> gonna

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
your CPU and stuff like that are gonna

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
your CPU and stuff like that are gonna
make<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> big<00:01:01.680> difference<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> comes

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

the reason why I want to talk about the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
the reason why I want to talk about the
mouse<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.600> opinion<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:19.080> being

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
mouse first and in my opinion have being

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
mouse first and in my opinion have being
the<00:01:19.439> most<00:01:19.619> important<00:01:20.340> gaming<00:01:20.640> peripherals

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the most important gaming peripherals

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
the most important gaming peripherals
back<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> pro<00:01:23.610> scene<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
back when I was on the pro scene in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.060 
back when I was on the pro scene in
StarCraft<00:01:24.689> brood<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
StarCraft brood was back way back in the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
StarCraft brood was back way back in the
early<00:01:26.310> 2000s<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.210> pro<00:01:27.420> gaming<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.930> had

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
early 2000s where pro gaming just had

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
early 2000s where pro gaming just had
absolutely<00:01:28.710> no<00:01:28.950> money<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.659> very

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
absolutely no money in it a little very

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
absolutely no money in it a little very
little<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> wasn't<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.700> good

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
little and it kind of wasn't a good

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.399 
little and it kind of wasn't a good
career<00:01:33.299> choice<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.990> time<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
career choice but at that time I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.350 
career choice but at that time I
actually<00:01:34.590> went<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> these<00:01:35.220> Sydney<00:01:35.700> finals<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
actually went to these Sydney finals in

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
actually went to these Sydney finals in
Australia<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> stock<00:01:37.439> Radford<00:01:37.829> Wars<00:01:38.070> and

Australia for a stock Radford Wars and

Australia for a stock Radford Wars and
they<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.509> different<00:01:39.680> mice<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.340> was

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
they had different mice there that I was

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
they had different mice there that I was
used<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> playing<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:43.140> using<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
used to playing on so I was using a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
used to playing on so I was using a
different<00:01:43.680> Mouse<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.100> obviously<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.850> didn't

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
different Mouse and obviously I I didn't

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.789 
different Mouse and obviously I I didn't
come<00:01:45.479> first<00:01:45.810> place<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> didn't<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
come first place or I didn't get in the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
come first place or I didn't get in the
top<00:01:47.009> three<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> tournament<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.119> was

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
top three in that tournament which was

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
top three in that tournament which was
sad<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.049> believe<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.950> had<00:01:50.070> brought<00:01:50.369> my

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
sad but I believe if I had brought my

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.730 
sad but I believe if I had brought my
own<00:01:50.729> gaming<00:01:51.119> peripherals<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.229> probably

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
own gaming peripherals there I probably

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.230 
own gaming peripherals there I probably
would<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.130> placed<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.700> higher<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
would have placed a lot higher than I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
would have placed a lot higher than I
otherwise<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> mention<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> fact

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
otherwise did not to mention the fact

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
otherwise did not to mention the fact
that<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.250> had<00:01:56.460> Samsung<00:01:57.210> LCD<00:01:57.530> monitors<00:01:58.530> there

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that they had Samsung LCD monitors there

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
that they had Samsung LCD monitors there

like back early back you know back in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.380 
like back early back you know back in
2000<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:04.110> Samsung<00:02:04.619> monitors<00:02:05.329> they<00:02:06.329> were

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
2000 these Samsung monitors they were

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.819 
2000 these Samsung monitors they were
the<00:02:06.570> first<00:02:06.810> people<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> first

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the first people there one of the first

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
the first people there one of the first
companies<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.220> introduce<00:02:08.700> gaming<00:02:09.149> LCD

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
companies to introduce gaming LCD

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.300 
companies to introduce gaming LCD
monitors<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> essentially<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> input<00:02:11.129> lag

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
monitors and essentially the input lag

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
monitors and essentially the input lag
on<00:02:11.489> those<00:02:11.580> things<00:02:11.879> was<00:02:12.090> terrible<00:02:12.629> like

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
on those things was terrible like

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.410 
on those things was terrible like
compared<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:13.950> our<00:02:14.069> T's<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.150> actually

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
compared to see our T's so they actually

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
compared to see our T's so they actually
should<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.720> had<00:02:16.099> CRTs<00:02:17.099> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> tournament

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
should have had CRTs at the tournament

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820 
should have had CRTs at the tournament
in<00:02:18.060> my<00:02:18.209> opinion<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.560> things

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
in my opinion so it was these things

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.400 
in my opinion so it was these things
that<00:02:19.980> people<00:02:20.129> just<00:02:20.520> weren't<00:02:20.760> aware<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.230> at<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
that people just weren't aware of at the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.290 
that people just weren't aware of at the
time<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.610> back<00:02:23.819> with<00:02:24.120> me

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
time and now that I think back with me

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.030 
time and now that I think back with me
having<00:02:24.599> as<00:02:24.720> much<00:02:24.870> experience<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.500> tech<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
having as much experience with tech as I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.270 
having as much experience with tech as I
do<00:02:26.099> now<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.819> kind<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.569> wish<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.900> did<00:02:28.220> bring<00:02:29.220> my

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
do now I kind of wish I did bring my

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.240 
do now I kind of wish I did bring my
monitor<00:02:29.879> in<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.209> actual<00:02:30.690> mouse<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:32.099> keyboard

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
monitor in my actual mouse the keyboard

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.680 
monitor in my actual mouse the keyboard
no<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.730> doesn't<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.060> make<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.300> difference

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
no it doesn't really make a difference

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.790 
no it doesn't really make a difference
that<00:02:33.750> would<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:33.989> meant<00:02:34.170> wouldn't<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.620> made

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that would have meant wouldn't have made

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.470 
that would have meant wouldn't have made
a<00:02:34.830> difference<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.430> much<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:36.000> mouse<00:02:36.209> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
a difference so much but the mouse and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.030 
a difference so much but the mouse and
the<00:02:36.569> monitor<00:02:36.989> would<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.530> made<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> huge

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the monitor would have made a huge

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.250 
the monitor would have made a huge
difference<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.580> my<00:02:38.730> opinion<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.050> mouse

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
difference in my opinion so the mouse

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.350 
difference in my opinion so the mouse
you<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.739> basically<00:02:40.980> get<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:41.519> you

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you have to basically get it right you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.670 
you have to basically get it right you
know<00:02:42.420> there's<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> different<00:02:43.260> mice<00:02:43.440> out

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
know there's a lot of different mice out

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250 
know there's a lot of different mice out
there<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.760> ultimately<00:02:45.000> depends<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.900> what

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
there and it ultimately depends on what

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.520 
there and it ultimately depends on what
kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.650> grip<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.190> use<00:02:47.930> what<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.260> weight

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
kind of grip you use what kind of weight

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.650 
kind of grip you use what kind of weight
you<00:02:49.709> prefer<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.150> sensor<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you prefer and what kind of sensor you

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.809 
you prefer and what kind of sensor you
prefer<00:02:52.019> as<00:02:52.170> well<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.370> are<00:02:53.550> things<00:02:53.700> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
prefer as well so these are things that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.490 
prefer as well so these are things that
you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.269> decide<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.780> yourself<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.379> I'm

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
you have to decide for yourself but I'm

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410 
you have to decide for yourself but I'm
gonna<00:02:55.650> say<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.250> you're<00:02:56.430> looking<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> gaming

straight<00:03:08.730> off<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.120> get-go<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.310> for

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
straight off the get-go but on now for

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.040 
straight off the get-go but on now for
monitors<00:03:11.909> let's<00:03:12.180> talk<00:03:12.360> about<00:03:12.510> monitors

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
monitors let's talk about monitors

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.390 
monitors let's talk about monitors
quickly<00:03:13.409> so<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:13.680> mouse<00:03:13.830> would<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.099> your<00:03:14.220> top

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
quickly so your mouse would be your top

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.770 
quickly so your mouse would be your top
priority<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:14.909> after<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.330> your<00:03:15.540> monitor

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
priority but after that your monitor

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.750 
priority but after that your monitor
definitely<00:03:16.319> scores<00:03:17.010> pretty<00:03:17.220> high<00:03:17.519> there

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
definitely scores pretty high there

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.270 
definitely scores pretty high there
because<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.209> didn't<00:03:18.720> realize<00:03:19.080> this<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.709> had

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
because I didn't realize this but I had

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.030 
because I didn't realize this but I had
an<00:03:20.400> ASA<00:03:20.670> monitor<00:03:21.209> here<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.659> it<00:03:22.050> was<00:03:22.170> my<00:03:22.440> 1080p

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
an ASA monitor here and it was my 1080p

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.850 
an ASA monitor here and it was my 1080p
60<00:03:23.489> Hertz<00:03:23.670> monitor<00:03:23.909> now<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.360> used<00:03:24.659> this<00:03:24.860> monitor

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
60 Hertz monitor now I used this monitor

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
60 Hertz monitor now I used this monitor
up<00:03:25.980> until<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.310> got<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> 120<00:03:26.879> Hertz<00:03:27.330> Samsung

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
up until I got the 120 Hertz Samsung

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.199 
up until I got the 120 Hertz Samsung
monitor<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:29.340> monitor<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.790> got<00:03:30.060> to

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
monitor and on this monitor I got to

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.479 
monitor and on this monitor I got to
like<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.659> think<00:03:30.900> 1,900<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.920> heroes<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
like I think 1,900 in heroes in you

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.670 
like I think 1,900 in heroes in you
earth<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:32.970> got<00:03:33.120> up<00:03:33.239> pretty<00:03:33.599> high<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.110> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
earth so I got up pretty high in the you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.770 
earth so I got up pretty high in the you
know<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.209> competitive<00:03:36.209> scene<00:03:36.510> there

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
know in the competitive scene there

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.690 
know in the competitive scene there
wasn't<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.349> wasn't<00:03:37.620> really<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.920> any<00:03:38.040> teams<00:03:38.430> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
wasn't I wasn't really on any teams is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.300 
wasn't I wasn't really on any teams is
just<00:03:38.909> in<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> solo<00:03:39.450> queue<00:03:39.900> matchmaking<00:03:40.440> but

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
just in the solo queue matchmaking but

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.100 
just in the solo queue matchmaking but
essentially<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.819> got<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.390> hundred<00:03:42.780> twenty<00:03:43.019> Hertz

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
essentially I got a hundred twenty Hertz

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.259 
essentially I got a hundred twenty Hertz
samsung<00:03:43.650> monitor<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.459> noticed<00:03:44.760> my<00:03:44.849> rating

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
samsung monitor and I noticed my rating

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.030 
samsung monitor and I noticed my rating
had<00:03:45.420> dropped<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.019> huge<00:03:46.260> amount<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.799> went

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
had dropped a huge amount like I went

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.850 
had dropped a huge amount like I went
back<00:03:47.220> into<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.610> high<00:03:47.870> 1700s<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.379> I<00:03:49.739> was

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
back into the high 1700s and I was

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.250 
back into the high 1700s and I was
wondering<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.340> myself<00:03:50.370> what<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.510> why<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.900> this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
wondering to myself what is why is this

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.949 
wondering to myself what is why is this
but<00:03:52.590> now<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.670> know<00:03:54.299> all<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.659> recent

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
but now that I know all the recent

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.170 
but now that I know all the recent
testing<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.439> did<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.890> Samsung<00:03:56.400> 120<00:03:57.000> Hertz

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
testing I did on the Samsung 120 Hertz

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.850 
testing I did on the Samsung 120 Hertz
monitor<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.569> found<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.959> had<00:03:58.019> input<00:03:58.620> lag

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
monitor I found that I had input lag

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.850 
monitor I found that I had input lag
there<00:03:59.549> was<00:03:59.700> actually<00:04:00.150> worse<00:04:00.959> than<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.379> IPS

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
there was actually worse than the IPS

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.500 
there was actually worse than the IPS
monitor<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.489> I'm<00:04:02.580> using<00:04:02.790> at<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.060> monitor<00:04:03.360> at

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
monitor that I'm using at the monitor at

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
monitor that I'm using at the monitor at
the<00:04:03.720> moment<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.230> didn't<00:04:04.739> realize<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.129> the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the moment I didn't realize but the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.910 
the moment I didn't realize but the
Aysen<00:04:05.549> monitor<00:04:05.849> had<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.299> 15<00:04:06.840> good<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> good<00:04:07.530> 15

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
Aysen monitor had like 15 good a good 15

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.990 
Aysen monitor had like 15 good a good 15
milliseconds

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
milliseconds

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.360 
milliseconds
over<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:09.959> IPS<00:04:10.500> monitor<00:04:10.890> I'm<00:04:10.980> using<00:04:11.159> at<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
over this IPS monitor I'm using at the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.210 
over this IPS monitor I'm using at the
moment<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.939> this<00:04:12.269> IPS<00:04:12.689> monitor<00:04:13.140> had<00:04:13.439> even

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
moment and this IPS monitor had even

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.610 
moment and this IPS monitor had even
less<00:04:15.090> input<00:04:15.420> light<00:04:15.599> in<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> Samsung<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.500> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
less input light in the Samsung so the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.310 
less input light in the Samsung so the
Samsung<00:04:17.040> was<00:04:17.190> basically<00:04:17.579> an<00:04:17.910> input<00:04:18.570> lag<00:04:18.780> beast

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
Samsung was basically an input lag beast

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.590 
Samsung was basically an input lag beast
so<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.949> didn't<00:04:20.310> realize<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.759> but<00:04:20.850> 120<00:04:21.449> Hertz

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
so I didn't realize it but 120 Hertz

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.450 
so I didn't realize it but 120 Hertz
monitor<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.259> I<00:04:22.320> was<00:04:22.470> using<00:04:22.680> actually

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
monitor that I was using actually

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.879 
monitor that I was using actually
introduced<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.060> lot<00:04:24.330> of

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
introduced a lot of

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.159 
introduced a lot of
input<00:04:25.129> lag<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.789> be<00:04:26.659> careful<00:04:27.020> with<00:04:27.110> what

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
input lag so be careful with what

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.860 
input lag so be careful with what
monitor<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.009> use<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.849> may<00:04:29.090> experience<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.840> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
monitor you use it may experience the a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.330 
monitor you use it may experience the a
some<00:04:30.289> monitors<00:04:30.650> they're<00:04:30.800> actually<00:04:31.099> really

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
some monitors they're actually really

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.219 
some monitors they're actually really
good<00:04:31.490> bang<00:04:31.879> for<00:04:31.909> buck<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.659> mean<00:04:32.990> sure<00:04:33.199> the

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
good bang for buck I mean sure the

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.279 
good bang for buck I mean sure the
colors<00:04:33.770> might<00:04:34.159> not<00:04:34.340> be<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.639> good<00:04:34.939> the<00:04:35.659> this

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
colors might not be that good the this

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.510 
colors might not be that good the this
and<00:04:36.439> that<00:04:36.560> might<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:36.860> be<00:04:37.009> that<00:04:37.129> good<00:04:37.279> but<00:04:37.400> if

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
and that might not be that good but if

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550 
and that might not be that good but if
you're<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.699> competitive<00:04:38.210> gamer<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:38.990> input<00:04:39.319> lag

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
you're a competitive gamer the input lag

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.580 
you're a competitive gamer the input lag
on<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:41.150> sub<00:04:41.569> monitor<00:04:41.900> is<00:04:41.990> actually<00:04:42.289> really

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
on a a sub monitor is actually really

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.769 
on a a sub monitor is actually really
good<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.699> that's<00:04:43.789> one<00:04:44.029> thing<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.419> wanted<00:04:44.689> to

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:44.779 
good so that's one thing I wanted to

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.959 
good so that's one thing I wanted to
share<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:45.259> guys<00:04:45.319> as<00:04:45.650> well<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:45.969> anyway

know decent mouse mice they got out

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.399 
know decent mouse mice they got out
there<00:04:54.949> and<00:04:55.330> maybe<00:04:56.330> get<00:04:56.539> an<00:04:56.659> Acer<00:04:56.810> monitor<00:04:57.289> as

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
there and maybe get an Acer monitor as

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.290 
there and maybe get an Acer monitor as
well<00:04:57.439> like<00:04:58.009> I've<00:04:58.430> got<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.669> actually<00:04:58.939> test<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
well like I've got to actually test the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.909 
well like I've got to actually test the
Zeus<00:04:59.659> monitors<00:05:00.110> as<00:05:00.259> well<00:05:00.439> I've<00:05:00.590> heard<00:05:00.740> they're

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
Zeus monitors as well I've heard they're

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.740 
Zeus monitors as well I've heard they're
really<00:05:01.219> good<00:05:01.400> they<00:05:01.819> got<00:05:01.969> really<00:05:02.150> low<00:05:02.389> input

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
really good they got really low input

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.290 
really good they got really low input
lag<00:05:02.930> as<00:05:03.110> well<00:05:03.319> so<00:05:04.279> I<00:05:04.580> think<00:05:04.639> in<00:05:04.969> terms<00:05:05.180> of

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
lag as well so I think in terms of

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.990 
lag as well so I think in terms of
employee<00:05:05.750> input<00:05:06.050> lag<00:05:06.199> for<00:05:06.439> LCDs<00:05:06.919> I<00:05:07.069> think<00:05:07.310> Acer

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
employee input lag for LCDs I think Acer

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.760 
employee input lag for LCDs I think Acer
and<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.210> Zeus<00:05:08.449> definitely<00:05:09.110> score<00:05:09.409> some<00:05:09.650> high

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
and a Zeus definitely score some high

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.170 
and a Zeus definitely score some high
points<00:05:10.099> I've<00:05:10.189> also<00:05:10.340> heard<00:05:10.580> Bank<00:05:10.879> you<00:05:11.060> look

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
points I've also heard Bank you look

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.240 
points I've also heard Bank you look
pretty<00:05:11.389> good<00:05:11.509> as<00:05:11.629> well<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:12.469> for<00:05:12.770> my<00:05:12.889> experience

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
pretty good as well so for my experience

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.369 
pretty good as well so for my experience
though<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.729> think<00:05:13.939> Samsung<00:05:14.210> wow<00:05:15.050> they<00:05:15.229> got<00:05:15.319> a

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
though I think Samsung wow they got a

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.749 
though I think Samsung wow they got a
bit<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.590> input<00:05:15.740> lag<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:16.069> they've<00:05:16.339> got<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.550> fix

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
bit of input lag that they've got to fix

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.760 
bit of input lag that they've got to fix

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
trying to go pro but unfortunately as I

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.579 
trying to go pro but unfortunately as I
get<00:05:55.580> older<00:05:55.729> I<00:05:56.300> don't<00:05:56.449> think<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.349> will<00:05:57.439> the

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:57.589 
get older I don't think it will the

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.040 
get older I don't think it will the
amount<00:05:57.889> of<00:05:57.979> pro<00:05:58.310> that's<00:05:58.610> left<00:05:58.879> in<00:05:59.120> me<00:05:59.330> slowly

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
amount of pro that's left in me slowly

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.869 
amount of pro that's left in me slowly
