what I want to show you here is how I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.749 
what I want to show you here is how I
took<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.420> tail<00:00:12.809> skid<00:00:13.080> off<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.590> use<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.429> about

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
took the tail skid off and use it about

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
took the tail skid off and use it about
five<00:00:15.059> dollars<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.599> parts<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.139> made<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> really

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
five dollars in parts we made a really

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500 
five dollars in parts we made a really
really<00:00:16.710> nice<00:00:17.010> steerable<00:00:17.640> tailwheel<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.390> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
really nice steerable tailwheel for this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.890 
really nice steerable tailwheel for this
thing<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.020> let's<00:00:19.710> take<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.449> back<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.750> on

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
thing so let's take a look back here on

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.290 
thing so let's take a look back here on
the<00:00:22.080> tail<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> airplane<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.210> we

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the tail of the airplane and see what we

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.429 
the tail of the airplane and see what we
have<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.099> there's<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.340> steerable<00:00:26.789> tailwheel

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
have so there's the steerable tailwheel

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.209 
have so there's the steerable tailwheel
assembly<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> well<00:00:30.269> we've<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:31.170> here

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
assembly so well we've got right here

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.720 
assembly so well we've got right here
this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.989> simple<00:00:33.989> dubrow<00:00:34.520> tail<00:00:35.520> wheel

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
this is just a simple dubrow tail wheel

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is just a simple dubrow tail wheel
assembly<00:00:36.239> comes<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.170> um<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.280> actual

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
assembly comes with this um the actual

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
assembly comes with this um the actual
tail<00:00:39.239> wheel<00:00:39.540> rod<00:00:39.840> itself<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
tail wheel rod itself and then the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.990 
tail wheel rod itself and then the
support<00:00:41.340> brace<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.600> also<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.829> taller<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
support brace and also a lot taller so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840 
support brace and also a lot taller so
this<00:00:45.600> particular<00:00:46.129> bracket<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> 40

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this particular bracket is for a 40

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.310 
this particular bracket is for a 40
sized<00:00:48.030> airplane<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> believe<00:00:48.809> its<00:00:48.930> catalog

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
sized airplane I believe its catalog

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.490 
sized airplane I believe its catalog
number<00:00:49.620> 375<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.879> show<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> package<00:00:52.199> here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
number 375 and show you the package here

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.939 
number 375 and show you the package here
so<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> whole<00:00:54.780> tail<00:00:55.110> wheel<00:00:55.350> assembly

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
so that's the whole tail wheel assembly

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.410 
so that's the whole tail wheel assembly
right<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:58.609> it<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.789> not<00:00:59.940> include<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
right there it does not include the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
right there it does not include the
wheel<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.230> wheel<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.559> additional<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.010> believe

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
wheel the wheel was additional I believe

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
wheel the wheel was additional I believe
this<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> three<00:01:02.850> quarter<00:01:03.210> inch<00:01:03.949> Sullivan

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this is a three quarter inch Sullivan

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.690 
this is a three quarter inch Sullivan
wheel<00:01:06.080> yeah<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> three<00:01:07.920> quarter<00:01:08.250> inch

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
wheel yeah it's a three quarter inch

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.560 
wheel yeah it's a three quarter inch
Sullivan<00:01:09.689> care<00:01:09.930> wheel<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.970> look<00:01:12.299> what

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Sullivan care wheel so if you look what

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.179 
Sullivan care wheel so if you look what
we've<00:01:12.720> had<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:14.070> bit

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
we've had to do here just a little bit

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
we've had to do here just a little bit
of<00:01:14.369> modification<00:01:15.439> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.280> bracket<00:01:17.729> itself<00:01:18.200> we

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
of modification on the bracket itself we

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.010 
of modification on the bracket itself we
kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> lucked<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.700> bottom<00:01:21.600> hole

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
kind of lucked out and the bottom hole

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.920 
kind of lucked out and the bottom hole
either<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> bottom<00:01:23.250> hole<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> bracket

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
either the bottom hole of the bracket

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.429 
either the bottom hole of the bracket
lines<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.460> with<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> factory<00:01:27.439> vertical

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
lines up with the factory vertical

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
lines up with the factory vertical
stabilizer<00:01:28.920> bolts<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> do

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
stabilizer bolts so we didn't have to do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
stabilizer bolts so we didn't have to do
any<00:01:31.350> modification<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.299> get

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
any modification here to get this to get

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.030 
any modification here to get this to get
the<00:01:33.509> bracket<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> place<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.890> really

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the bracket in place and you really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
the bracket in place and you really
can't<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.820> inside<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.360> where

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can't see it but up inside here where

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.219 
can't see it but up inside here where
the<00:01:36.509> second<00:01:36.840> hole<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.220> simple

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
the second hole is this is just a simple

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
the second hole is this is just a simple
half-inch<00:01:40.229> wood<00:01:40.439> screw<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:41.430> through<00:01:41.490> there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
half-inch wood screw right through there

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760 
half-inch wood screw right through there
so<00:01:42.390> let<00:01:42.630> me<00:01:42.689> spin<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> airplane<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> side

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so let me spin the airplane to the side

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.340 
so let me spin the airplane to the side
a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:45.170> some<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a little bit and you can see some of the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.109 
a little bit and you can see some of the
bins<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.890> we've<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.759> let's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
bins that we've got going on there let's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
bins that we've got going on there let's
spin<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.750> side<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.290> may<00:01:49.380> be

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
spin it to the other side and it may be

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
spin it to the other side and it may be
a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.680> bit<00:01:49.860> easier<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.659> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a little bit easier to see it if I can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.830 
a little bit easier to see it if I can
get<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> even<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> go

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
get it even in there so there you go

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.709 
get it even in there so there you go
right<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.829> bent<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.240> 45

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
right here we bent this up at about a 45

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.999 
right here we bent this up at about a 45
degree<00:01:57.750> angle<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.380> absorb<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
degree angle to absorb some of that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
degree angle to absorb some of that
shock<00:01:59.479> hook<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> collar<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:02.509> had<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
shock hook the collar on the had to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.469 
shock hook the collar on the had to
notch<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.380> horizontal<00:02:05.219> stabilizer<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
notch the horizontal stabilizer just a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
notch the horizontal stabilizer just a
little<00:02:06.689> bit<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:06.990> can't<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.740> too

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
little bit you really can't see it too

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.529 
little bit you really can't see it too
good<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.119> had<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.330> notch<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
good but right here we had to notch the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.890 
good but right here we had to notch the
horizontal<00:02:10.170> stabilizer<00:02:10.619> where<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.690> mm<00:02:12.690> where

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
horizontal stabilizer where the mm where

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
horizontal stabilizer where the mm where
the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
the
tail<00:02:13.920> wheel<00:02:14.190> shaft<00:02:14.970> runs<00:02:15.390> through<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.960> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
tail wheel shaft runs through there and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.670 
tail wheel shaft runs through there and
then<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> look<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.470> had<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
then if you look you can see we had to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.390 
then if you look you can see we had to
make<00:02:19.980> two<00:02:20.520> more<00:02:20.760> bins<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:23.100> had<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
make two more bins in this we had to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340 
make two more bins in this we had to
bend<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.210> way<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
bend all the way up in the back so that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.860 
bend all the way up in the back so that
we<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.590> run<00:02:25.770> parallel<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.330> bottom<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
we could run parallel to the bottom of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.070 
we could run parallel to the bottom of
the<00:02:28.310> rudder<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:30.210> another<00:02:30.480> 90<00:02:30.810> degree

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the rudder and then another 90 degree

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
the rudder and then another 90 degree
bin<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.860> inside<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> rudder<00:02:32.550> just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
bin going up inside the rudder just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.940 
bin going up inside the rudder just
drilled<00:02:33.420> out<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> small<00:02:33.930> hole<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.560> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
drilled out a small hole there and it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.730 
drilled out a small hole there and it
went<00:02:35.210> so<00:02:36.210> about<00:02:36.450> five<00:02:36.720> dollars<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.230> parts<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
went so about five dollars in parts and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.030 
went so about five dollars in parts and
real<00:02:38.640> quick<00:02:38.880> assembly<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.740> said

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
real quick assembly and it's all said

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
real quick assembly and it's all said
and<00:02:41.070> done<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.730> I've<00:02:41.910> got<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> nice<00:02:42.330> steerable

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and done so I've got a nice steerable

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.460 
and done so I've got a nice steerable
tailwheel<00:02:43.340> here<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.210> let's<00:02:45.900> take<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> look<00:02:46.380> at

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
tailwheel here so let's take a look at

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.970 
tailwheel here so let's take a look at
this<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:48.050> see<00:02:49.050> what<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> ground<00:02:49.530> handling

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
this and see what the ground handling

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
this and see what the ground handling
capabilities<00:02:50.610> look<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.330> thing

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
capabilities look like on this thing

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.580 
capabilities look like on this thing
shall<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.210> difference<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.050> makes<00:02:58.350> in

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
shall we so the difference it makes in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.490 
shall we so the difference it makes in
this<00:02:58.740> airplane<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.610> unbelievable

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
this airplane is just unbelievable

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.490 
this airplane is just unbelievable
highly<00:03:01.500> maneuverable<00:03:02.160> now<00:03:03.020> very<00:03:04.020> easy<00:03:04.290> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
highly maneuverable now very easy to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.070 
highly maneuverable now very easy to
keep<00:03:04.650> under<00:03:04.950> control<00:03:05.180> tail<00:03:06.180> doesn't<00:03:06.450> slip<00:03:06.870> all

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
keep under control tail doesn't slip all

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.900 
keep under control tail doesn't slip all
over<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> place<00:03:07.940> during<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.240> sponsored<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
over the place during the sponsored and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.070 
over the place during the sponsored and
probably<00:03:11.910> didn't<00:03:12.120> take<00:03:12.240> but<00:03:12.390> about<00:03:12.540> 15

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
probably didn't take but about 15

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.410 
probably didn't take but about 15
minutes<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.730> took<00:03:14.910> longer<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.270> actually

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
minutes and it took longer to actually

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.210 
minutes and it took longer to actually
find<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.960> parts<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.350> were<00:03:16.470> looking<00:03:16.770> for<00:03:17.010> than

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
find the parts we were looking for than

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.390 
find the parts we were looking for than
it<00:03:17.310> did<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:18.410> actually<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> plane<00:03:20.100> rigged

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
it did to actually get the plane rigged

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.080 
it did to actually get the plane rigged
up<00:03:20.959> let's<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.190> all<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.790> way<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.030> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
up let's just do it all the way in a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.490 
up let's just do it all the way in a
circle<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:25.080> what<00:03:25.230> kind<00:03:25.440> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
circle here see what kind of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.540 
circle here see what kind of
maneuverability<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.310> get<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.940> there<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> go

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
maneuverability we get and there you go

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.820 
maneuverability we get and there you go
nothing<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.580> it
