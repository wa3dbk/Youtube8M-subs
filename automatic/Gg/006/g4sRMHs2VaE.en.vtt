00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

hi<00:00:00.570> so<00:00:01.170> today<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.979> be<00:00:02.040> taking<00:00:02.310> a

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hi so today we're going to be taking a

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.210 
hi so today we're going to be taking a
look<00:00:02.429> at<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:02.730> CDR<00:00:03.179> King<00:00:03.480> AC<00:00:03.780> adapter<00:00:04.589> now

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
look at this CDR King AC adapter now

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.639 
look at this CDR King AC adapter now
this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.730> 12<00:00:06.029> volts<00:00:06.450> free<00:00:06.750> amp<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.470> came

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
this is 12 volts free amp and it came

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is 12 volts free amp and it came
with<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> set<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.309> LED<00:00:08.820> strip<00:00:09.300> lights<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.870> never

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
with a set of LED strip lights I never

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.379 
with a set of LED strip lights I never
used<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.550> intended<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> connect

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
used it because I intended to connect

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.410 
used it because I intended to connect
these<00:00:12.570> strips<00:00:12.960> directly<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> solar<00:00:13.860> battery

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
these strips directly to a solar battery

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.599 
these strips directly to a solar battery
so<00:00:15.420> earlier<00:00:16.109> today<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.500> needed<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> 12<00:00:17.400> volt

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
so earlier today I needed a 12 volt

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.250 
so earlier today I needed a 12 volt
power<00:00:17.789> source<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.480> thought<00:00:18.630> okay<00:00:18.930> I'll<00:00:19.050> use

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
power source and I thought okay I'll use

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.120 
power source and I thought okay I'll use
the<00:00:19.500> CDR<00:00:20.070> king<00:00:20.100> AC<00:00:21.060> adapter<00:00:21.830> plugged<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.010> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the CDR king AC adapter plugged it in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.240 
the CDR king AC adapter plugged it in
this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> okay<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.619> weird<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.130> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is okay that's a bit weird then it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
this is okay that's a bit weird then it
got<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> little<00:00:26.519> bit<00:00:26.699> louder<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:27.960> all

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
got a little bit louder and then if all

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.169 
got a little bit louder and then if all
that<00:00:28.500> doesn't<00:00:28.710> sound<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.250> good<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> could

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that doesn't sound so good now I could

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.939 
that doesn't sound so good now I could
have<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.420> unplugged<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.289> firmly<00:00:31.679> away

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
have just unplugged it and firmly away

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
have just unplugged it and firmly away
but<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> wanted<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.239> would<00:00:33.329> happen

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
but I wanted to see what would happen

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.799 
but I wanted to see what would happen
so<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.920> basically<00:00:35.640> moved<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.270> somewhere<00:00:36.390> safe

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so I basically moved it somewhere safe

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
so I basically moved it somewhere safe
and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.829> moved<00:00:38.160> away<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and then you know moved away from it and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
and then you know moved away from it and
sure<00:00:39.420> enough<00:00:39.450> after<00:00:40.050> around<00:00:40.230> 2<00:00:40.559> minutes<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sure enough after around 2 minutes it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490 
sure enough after around 2 minutes it
went<00:00:41.219> bang<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.629> assuming<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.320> least

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
went bang so I'm assuming that at least

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
went bang so I'm assuming that at least
one<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> classes<00:00:44.399> inside<00:00:44.760> has<00:00:45.090> blown<00:00:45.420> now

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
one of the classes inside has blown now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.869 
one of the classes inside has blown now
a<00:00:46.230> weird<00:00:46.500> thing<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> still<00:00:47.190> continued<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
a weird thing is it still continued to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
a weird thing is it still continued to
output<00:00:48.300> 12<00:00:48.629> volts<00:00:48.960> even<00:00:49.110> after<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
output 12 volts even after that so I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.869 
output 12 volts even after that so I
fall<00:00:51.090> okay<00:00:51.539> well<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.350> I'll<00:00:52.649> keep<00:00:53.010> this

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
fall okay well you know I'll keep this

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.260 
fall okay well you know I'll keep this
cable<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.530> cut<00:00:55.829> off<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.250> end<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.120> know

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
cable and I cut off the end and you know

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
cable and I cut off the end and you know
I<00:00:57.300> thought<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:57.780> I'll<00:00:57.899> keep<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.530> as

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I thought okay I'll keep this bit as

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
I thought okay I'll keep this bit as
well<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> I've<00:00:59.309> still<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.789> nice

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
well so that I've still got this nice

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.319 
well so that I've still got this nice
barrel<00:01:00.359> jack<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> nice<00:01:01.649> piece<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> wire<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
barrel jack and nice piece of wire and I

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.549 
barrel jack and nice piece of wire and I
thought<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.470> more

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
thought actually it would be more

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
thought actually it would be more
interesting<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:05.880> would<00:01:05.970> happen<00:01:06.150> if

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
interesting to see what would happen if

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.590 
interesting to see what would happen if
I<00:01:06.479> continued<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.110> leave<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.790> it's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I continued to leave this to run so it's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
I continued to leave this to run so it's
already<00:01:09.930> gone<00:01:10.020> bang<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> catch<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
already gone bang but will it catch on

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
already gone bang but will it catch on
fire<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> explode<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.439> what

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
fire will it explode I don't know what

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.609 
fire will it explode I don't know what
will<00:01:13.770> happen<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.850> still<00:01:15.060> outputting<00:01:15.570> power

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
will happen it's still outputting power

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
will happen it's still outputting power
so<00:01:16.619> I've<00:01:17.070> trimmed<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> ends<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> I'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
so I've trimmed the ends here and I'll

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.789 
so I've trimmed the ends here and I'll
just<00:01:19.020> connect<00:01:19.380> some<00:01:21.229> then<00:01:22.229> I'll<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.530> connect

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
just connect some then I'll just connect

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
just connect some then I'll just connect
these<00:01:22.950> crocodile<00:01:23.460> clips<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.390> we'll<00:01:24.750> hook<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
these crocodile clips and we'll hook it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.859 
these crocodile clips and we'll hook it
up<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> voltmeter<00:01:26.030> plug<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> wall<00:01:27.420> run

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
up to a voltmeter plug into the wall run

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.170 
up to a voltmeter plug into the wall run
away<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.799> happens<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> really

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
away and see what happens so I really

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.520 
away and see what happens so I really
have<00:01:30.299> no<00:01:30.479> idea<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.140> sure<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.409> don't

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
have no idea now to make sure we don't

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
have no idea now to make sure we don't
get<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> short-circuit<00:01:35.250> I'll<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.880> add<00:01:36.030> some

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
get a short-circuit I'll just add some

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.160 
get a short-circuit I'll just add some
electrical<00:01:36.659> tape<00:01:38.570> although<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
electrical tape although I don't think a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
electrical tape although I don't think a
short-circuit<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.130> biggest<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> our

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
short-circuit is the biggest of our

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.250 
short-circuit is the biggest of our
concerns<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.630> point

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.950 

okay<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:49.590> they're<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.100> safely<00:01:50.850> apart<00:01:51.810> from

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
okay so they're now safely apart from

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.910 
okay so they're now safely apart from
each<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:54.710> will<00:01:55.710> connect<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> voltmeter

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.590 

so<00:02:01.920> I'm<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> plug<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> I'm

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so I'm about to plug it in and I'm

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.080 
so I'm about to plug it in and I'm
pretty<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> run<00:02:04.470> away

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.990 

yikes<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:18.080> making<00:02:18.500> noise<00:02:18.709> I'm<00:02:19.640> around

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
yikes it's making noise I'm around

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.759 
yikes it's making noise I'm around
another<00:02:20.269> worn<00:02:20.599> out<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.019> there's<00:02:21.319> no<00:02:21.379> way

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
another worn out because there's no way

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.050 
another worn out because there's no way
I<00:02:21.800> want<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.129> be<00:02:22.250> near<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.459> thing<00:02:22.760> if<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:22.940> got

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I want to be near that thing if you got

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.920 
I want to be near that thing if you got
to<00:02:23.180> bang<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:25.849> go<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:27.200> gonna<00:02:27.349> go<00:02:27.530> pop

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.199 

I'm<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.829> glad<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.280> behind<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.640> wall<00:02:31.819> right<00:02:32.000> now

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
I'm so glad I'm behind a wall right now

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:46.360 
I'm so glad I'm behind a wall right now
oh<00:02:36.489> oh<00:02:44.109> so<00:02:45.109> I<00:02:45.560> don't<00:02:46.159> know<00:02:46.250> if<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
oh oh so I don't know if you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.619 
oh oh so I don't know if you
would<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.519> seen<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.359> certainly

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
would have seen it but you certainly

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.550 
would have seen it but you certainly
would<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:47.959> heard<00:02:48.200> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
would have heard it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:05.180 
would have heard it
it<00:02:49.040> went<00:02:49.280> Bob<00:02:51.189> that<00:02:52.189> was<00:02:52.750> interesting

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.460 

so<00:03:05.790> there's<00:03:05.970> no<00:03:06.180> damage<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> case<00:03:07.080> still

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
so there's no damage that the case still

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.670 
so there's no damage that the case still
looks<00:03:07.740> fine<00:03:11.780> let's<00:03:12.780> try<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.170> tear<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.500> thing

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
looks fine let's try and tear this thing

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670 
looks fine let's try and tear this thing
open<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.430> happened<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:16.170> might<00:03:16.410> take<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
open see what happened this might take a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.290 
open see what happened this might take a
while<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:17.040> I'll<00:03:17.610> probably<00:03:17.790> end<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.120> putting

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
while so I'll probably end up putting

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.900 
while so I'll probably end up putting
this<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.720> fast<00:03:19.680> motion<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:20.670> just<00:03:20.730> going

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
this in fast motion but I'm just going

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.630 
this in fast motion but I'm just going
to<00:03:21.000> try<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.780> open<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.320> case<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:23.160> plastic

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
to try and open this case it's plastic

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.700 
to try and open this case it's plastic
world<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.390> they're<00:03:25.230> always<00:03:25.350> difficult

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
world it's so they're always difficult

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.560 
world it's so they're always difficult
to<00:03:25.980> open

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.880 

I<00:03:35.750> don't<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.110> plastic<00:03:37.350> world<00:03:37.740> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
I don't really it is plastic world it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.800 
I don't really it is plastic world it
actually<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.550> just<00:03:38.810> flipped

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
actually I think it's just flipped

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.420 
actually I think it's just flipped
together

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:04:02.600 

hmm<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:49.580> look<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:51.660> smells<00:03:51.990> oh<00:03:53.120> that's<00:03:54.120> hot

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.060 

the<00:04:03.120> heatsink<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.720> warm<00:04:04.050> but<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.890> too<00:04:05.280> hot

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
the heatsink is warm but not too hot

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.480 
the heatsink is warm but not too hot
same<00:04:08.070> on<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.370> side<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.040> see<00:04:11.220> that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
same on this side now you can see that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.700 
same on this side now you can see that
this<00:04:12.030> capacitor<00:04:12.240> don't<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.290> how<00:04:13.440> will<00:04:13.620> you

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
this capacitor don't know how will you

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.990 
this capacitor don't know how will you
be<00:04:13.800> able<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.950> see<00:04:14.100> I'll<00:04:14.220> bring<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.490> close<00:04:14.760> up

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
be able to see I'll bring you close up

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.699 
be able to see I'll bring you close up
you<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:15.930> see<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.260> capacitors<00:04:17.070> blown<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
you can see that capacitors blown the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.640 
you can see that capacitors blown the
big<00:04:19.950> cap<00:04:20.250> here<00:04:20.610> has<00:04:21.090> not<00:04:21.330> blown<00:04:21.630> as<00:04:22.260> far<00:04:22.440> as<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
big cap here has not blown as far as I

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.040 
big cap here has not blown as far as I
can<00:04:22.710> see<00:04:23.930> let's<00:04:25.430> bring<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.670> little<00:04:26.970> bit

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.390 

I'm<00:04:31.050> going<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.320> be<00:04:31.410> careful<00:04:31.800> at<00:04:31.890> where<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.100> touch

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
I'm going to be careful at where I touch

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.790 
I'm going to be careful at where I touch
in<00:04:32.640> case<00:04:32.670> any<00:04:33.420> of<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:33.900> still<00:04:34.530> whole<00:04:34.680> new

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
in case any of this is still whole new

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.610 
in case any of this is still whole new
charge<00:04:35.100> especially<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> caps<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.870> cap<00:04:40.170> looks

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
charge especially the caps the cap looks

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.030 
charge especially the caps the cap looks
this<00:04:41.160> main<00:04:41.370> cap<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:42.570> cap<00:04:42.780> here<00:04:43.020> looks<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.890> be

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
this main cap the cap here looks to be

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.640 
this main cap the cap here looks to be
okay<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:45.330> smaller<00:04:45.630> caps<00:04:45.990> are<00:04:46.170> definitely

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
okay to smaller caps are definitely

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.010 
okay to smaller caps are definitely
blown<00:04:48.050> or<00:04:49.050> at<00:04:49.110> least<00:04:49.230> one<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.620> them<00:04:51.290> let's<00:04:54.020> look

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
blown or at least one of them let's look

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.260 
blown or at least one of them let's look
inside<00:04:55.200> this

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:14.340 

now<00:05:08.490> transformer<00:05:09.490> looks<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.820> be<00:05:09.940> okay<00:05:13.350> so

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
now transformer looks to be okay so

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.430 
now transformer looks to be okay so
interestingly<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.120> see<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.080> fuse

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
interestingly you can see that the fuse

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.200 
interestingly you can see that the fuse
here<00:05:18.040> is<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:18.640> blown<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:20.410> we<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.710> test<00:05:20.980> that

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
here is not blown and we can test that

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:39.610 
here is not blown and we can test that
with<00:05:22.210> my<00:05:22.540> a<00:05:22.570> multimeter

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.840 

everything<00:05:40.620> else<00:05:40.890> looks<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.880> be<00:05:42.030> okay<00:05:43.850> just

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
everything else looks to be okay just

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.450 
everything else looks to be okay just
try<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.180> have<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.540> look<00:05:45.720> through<00:05:45.960> here<00:05:49.460> there

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
try to have a look through here there

00:05:50.460 --> 00:06:00.580 
try to have a look through here there
are<00:05:50.580> some<00:05:50.760> small<00:05:51.330> caps<00:05:54.380> ceramic<00:05:55.380> caps

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.690 

yeah<00:06:01.250> just<00:06:02.180> looks<00:06:02.540> to<00:06:02.780> be<00:06:02.990> those<00:06:03.770> two<00:06:04.130> caps<00:06:04.460> on

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
yeah just looks to be those two caps on

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.940 
yeah just looks to be those two caps on
the<00:06:04.790> output<00:06:05.210> side<00:06:05.450> there<00:06:05.720> doesn't<00:06:05.930> appear<00:06:06.620> to
