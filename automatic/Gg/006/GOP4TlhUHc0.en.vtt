00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 which I was talking to you is not it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000

 my maximum of their possibilities 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.649
 all this for a single season with a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
 equal and comfort if you win your 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.980
 page 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 but before unveiling to compensate in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.280
 respect a few small rules I'm going 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.230
 not go on Tuesday I'll take the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 office rules and tournaments but with 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.409
 a little dictation anyway we go 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 start there nothing but justice for 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.550
 divulge this normally ie 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.059
 ban on fasting or falling asleep 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.339
 pokemon of a team simultaneously the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 rest does not count a donation that's too much 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.220
 easy and I did not win 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.369
 to fall asleep another no no no it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 count not take off if by bad luck 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 happens anyway whoever holds 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.020
 asleep or game the opponent will have to 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.399
 pokemon change of any kind 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.210
 woke up or have lunch and yeah that's the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:25.710
 punishment of extreme good I saw that the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 young lola meters even though I think that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 the guy 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 if he does that he is a little bit 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 con but prohibition first two 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.990
 identical pokemon in a team where 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.569
 I do not see the point of arriving 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 there never even avoid having 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.930
 combinations of attac pokemon of objects 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 that they make the fight last indefinitely 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 not that it forbids but just I 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.409
 have to apply how will 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 recorded is shown on youtube on 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 win at all costs 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 I count on you number with clapboard 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.970
 already because it's boring and then 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.870
 it's interesting win either shot 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.519
 luck 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
