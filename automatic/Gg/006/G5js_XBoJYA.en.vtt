00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
like that so what I'm gonna do to help
increase<00:02:33.659> our<00:02:34.409> production<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.370> probably

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
increase our production is probably

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.599 
increase our production is probably
invest<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> crop<00:02:37.140> rotation<00:02:38.780> um<00:02:40.459> but<00:02:41.459> we're

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
invest in a crop rotation um but we're

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.640 
invest in a crop rotation um but we're
currently<00:02:41.849> building<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:43.280> ballista<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:45.650> we

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
currently building a ballista here we

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.050 
currently building a ballista here we
have<00:02:46.980> an<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.519> over<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.760> guess<00:02:50.909> we

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
have an in over here and I guess we

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.839 
have an in over here and I guess we
could<00:02:51.180> build<00:02:51.359> here<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> castle<00:02:53.609> I

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
could build here this is a castle I

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.920 
could build here this is a castle I
don't<00:02:54.599> really<00:02:54.780> need<00:02:56.239> production<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.599> but<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
don't really need production here but I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.349 
don't really need production here but I
guess<00:02:58.139> I<00:02:58.290> could<00:02:58.849> see<00:02:59.849> if<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.090> build<00:03:01.280> mines<00:03:02.359> give

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
guess I could see if I build mines give

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.860 
guess I could see if I build mines give
us<00:03:03.450> 120<00:03:04.109> not<00:03:04.260> really<00:03:04.500> worth<00:03:04.680> it
