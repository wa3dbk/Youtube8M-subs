through<00:01:38.460> space<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> specific<00:01:40.409> for

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
through space and this is specific for

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.580

each region

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.249 
each region
then<00:01:43.460> we'll<00:01:43.670> look<00:01:43.850> at<00:01:44.090> passive<00:01:44.869> range<00:01:45.079> of

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
then we'll look at passive range of

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.520 
then we'll look at passive range of
motion<00:01:45.320> in<00:01:46.219> which<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.880> examiner<00:01:47.600> will<00:01:47.899> move

the joint through space passive range of
motion<00:01:52.039> looks<00:01:52.549> specifically<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.530> joint

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
motion looks specifically at joint

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.149 
motion looks specifically at joint
mobility<00:01:55.090> testing<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.960> N<00:01:57.170> feel<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.979> that
