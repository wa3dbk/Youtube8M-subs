00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.629
 good everyone who as you are 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.530
 this is a video for a surprise and two 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.790
 new 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 I think this video has liked a lot 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 because there is one thing that I am 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.670
 quite excited the surprise the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:27.510
 can you imagine down 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 effectively this later is 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.750
 important logically 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.610
 for naught or for are ten and 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.610
 twenty-five at night 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.260
 approach there is a bet here of 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.260
 nominal for sugar 4 there were fertile in 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.760
 all are now being the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.710
 images of when I found it I 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 I found in the morning and it was a clutch 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.089
 of seven fertile eggs or forgiveness 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.329
 seven eggs of which fertile are 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.149
 four and they are here, I have them 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.770
 made more than 90% moisture 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.119
 niculite mixed with water for 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.460
 humidity and air temperature and 32 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.250
 degrees as I have it with a mesh for 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.400
 Do not touch the movie 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.810
 and the margins that I'm seeing now the 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.850
 screen stop against by the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.430
 tomorrow he could not make video because he has 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.040
 a little bit of a hurry but I can take 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 those images that you see and now I'm 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.550
 quite happy this was a sunset 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.110
 from August 12 I can not upload the video 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.930
 before because if I'm not usually finished 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.430
 with the video that would upload previously 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.900
 then I had like two videos the same 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.210
 day and that seemed too much for 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.680
 so you have to wait for me and not say 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.619
 nothing on facebook so they form their pre 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.570
 sabers August 10 so there will be that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.229
 do calculations for when they are born and for 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.940
 course I will record it and we will be attentive 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.190
 I have already told you that the coast is 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 called by sweating goes to denominate 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.940
 big with the sum 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 logically if you have a bit of the theme 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.340
 of genetics are phases are dominant with 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.399
 which this arrival can only come out 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.399
 nominal or rise to 50% 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.430
 the next thing to teach are two new 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.490
 acquisitions that also ask me 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.740
 much where snakes ask where 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.660
 the purchases that those good purchases I 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.240
 the meters just bought the spot 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 it was the reptile fair and there he found 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.950
 but in this case I know a creator 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.020
 that is called to open that in fact be 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.580
 here in the channel and one day to come 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.550
 even that it sticks to its snakes and 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.140
 we see them and you know them and the truth that 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.430
 I bought a couple of snakes that I 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.430
 they like a lot to breathe 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.450
 the first 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 here is to notice that they cut aha 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.380
 I put here I put something so that you can 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.300
 see better 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.850
 I do this little bit is a male and you say 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.340
 Nor is rated good is not it nothing 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.910
 very extravagant good nominal but 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.790
 has the head is heterozygous from pipe 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.650
 You already know this phase if you do not know it 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.450
 I put collective though if you see the channel 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.770
 and the fixed ones I'm convinced that you 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.140
 you know is logically a layer of 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.880
 it's a recessive phase then this 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.620
 nominal machito we believe that the machito 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.860
 because we've done the popping and it's a 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.590
 little doubtful but it seems there are more and 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.350
 Well, here you see it is a phase that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.310
 very cool and I hope that in the future 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.310
 let's get 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 well our polygon has a name of 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.670
 moment we'll see what name hits and 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.770
 I leave here a little video campando 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.310
 it's an adult mouse that you do not see how 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.750
 they eat the truth how it's great and that's what 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.390
 feed once but we have advanced 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.980
 super fast and you will not see any problem 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.980
 so let's hope it's okay 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.699
 and it was the second exhibition 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.699
 also by david 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 that I go to a lot 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.300
 It's a classic result 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.830
 It is a classic also a male 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:53.070
 and as you see this phase 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.070
 It is an Andean region 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.350
 the head is a bit is a bit 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.760
 timid is we understand when a 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.770
 poquillo 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.270
 forgotten 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.660
 and the colors the truth that they are a 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.660
 pass 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:24.009
 and some colors that also has no name 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.190
 and nothing 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.569
 I have not eaten yet, did not care 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.949
 to eat but still something is not being 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.320
 adapting a bit the terrarium is a 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.780
 little nervous and others 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.070
 and he did not want to accept the food but with the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.960
 next week sure yes 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.780
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.920
 liked these new acquisitions the 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.690
 sorpresita the subject of eggs and 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.840
 eggs in the next videos up 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.840
 then 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.979
 Y
