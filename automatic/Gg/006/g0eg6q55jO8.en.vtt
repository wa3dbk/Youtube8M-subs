00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
what we say yes are you sure double

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.580 
what we say yes are you sure double
check<00:02:54.709> okay<00:02:55.709> naza<00:02:56.069> mode<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.459> functioning<00:02:57.030> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
check okay naza mode is functioning and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.509 
check okay naza mode is functioning and
the<00:02:58.590> important<00:02:58.890> thing<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.069> say<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.459> is

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
the important thing to say that this is

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.140 
the important thing to say that this is
not<00:02:59.670> a<00:03:00.030> nada<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.319> not<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.819> be<00:03:02.819> all<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.060> end

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
not a nada this is not a be all and end

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.789 
not a nada this is not a be all and end
or<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.660> easily<00:03:03.989> switch<00:03:04.170> between<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.769> two

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
or you can easily switch between the two

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.860 
or you can easily switch between the two
so<00:03:05.489> don't<00:03:05.700> worry<00:03:05.880> about<00:03:06.209> having<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.599> look<00:03:06.750> at

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so don't worry about having a look at

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.089 
so don't worry about having a look at
this<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.290> seeing<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.549> about<00:03:08.660> so

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
this and seeing what it's all about so

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.770

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
here as you can see down here we've got

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.280 
here as you can see down here we've got
the<00:03:23.609> patrol<00:03:23.970> mode<00:03:24.150> switch<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.900> basically

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the patrol mode switch this is basically

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.099 
the patrol mode switch this is basically
s1<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.519> at<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.640> moment<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.709> GPS<00:03:29.690> now<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
s1 so at the moment it's on GPS now it

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.229 
s1 so at the moment it's on GPS now it
goes<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.500> tea<00:03:31.680> mode<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.370> now<00:03:32.519> manually

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
goes to a tea mode I can now manually

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.190 
goes to a tea mode I can now manually
put<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.630> into<00:03:34.079> attitude<00:03:34.680> mode<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.989> then<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
put it into attitude mode and then you

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.770 
put it into attitude mode and then you
can<00:03:37.380> choose<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.680> third<00:03:38.100> position<00:03:38.660> what<00:03:39.660> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
can choose the third position what it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.910 
can choose the third position what it
wants<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:39.989> be<00:03:40.079> I've<00:03:40.230> currently<00:03:40.440> got<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> set<00:03:40.890> to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
wants to be I've currently got it set to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.080 
wants to be I've currently got it set to
manual<00:03:41.160> because<00:03:41.430> I've<00:03:41.609> been<00:03:41.700> practicing

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
manual because I've been practicing

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.090 
manual because I've been practicing
manual<00:03:42.359> flying<00:03:42.630> but<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.200> now<00:03:43.530> set<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
manual flying but you can now set it to

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.240 
manual flying but you can now set it to
automatically<00:03:44.850> going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.299> fail<00:03:45.510> safe<00:03:46.250> which

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
automatically going to fail safe which

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.190 
automatically going to fail safe which
means<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.609> will<00:03:47.760> do<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> return<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.049> home

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
means it will do the do a return to home

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.270 
means it will do the do a return to home
instead<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.590> having<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.829> switch<00:03:50.040> off<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
instead of having to switch off the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.009 
instead of having to switch off the
transmitter<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.850> can<00:03:51.000> flick<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.540> down<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
transmitter you can flick it down to the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.849 
transmitter you can flick it down to the
third<00:03:52.290> bottom<00:03:52.739> most<00:03:52.920> position<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.430> s<00:03:53.670> 1<00:03:54.859> i'm

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
third bottom most position on s 1 i'm

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
so it will drift with the wind because

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.360 
so it will drift with the wind because
the<00:04:15.930> satellite<00:04:16.380> weren't<00:04:16.620> correct<00:04:16.979> for<00:04:17.220> wind

drift<00:04:20.209> effectively<00:04:21.209> it's<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> same

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
can manually set it why would you want

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.650 
can manually set it why would you want
to<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.479> that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
to do that

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.270

up two reasons if you've got an original

up two reasons if you've got an original
vision<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.700> might<00:04:29.850> want<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.090> sit<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.110> drift

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
vision you might want to sit it to drift

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.570 
vision you might want to sit it to drift
with<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.500> wind<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.920> bit<00:04:32.040> smoother<00:04:32.460> for

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
with the wind it's a bit smoother for

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.190 
with the wind it's a bit smoother for
video<00:04:32.850> because<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.510> vision<00:04:33.810> doesn't<00:04:33.960> really

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200

axis stabilizer the other reason why you

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.590 
axis stabilizer the other reason why you
might<00:04:38.460> want<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.790> switch<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.180> over<00:04:39.330> is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
might want to switch that over is

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.450 
might want to switch that over is
because<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.350> t-mo<00:04:40.650> gives<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.070> little<00:04:41.280> bit

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
because a t-mo gives you a little bit

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.690 
because a t-mo gives you a little bit
more<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:42.900> little<00:04:43.500> bit<00:04:43.770> more<00:04:43.950> tilt<00:04:44.340> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
more a little bit more tilt and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.310 
more a little bit more tilt and
therefore<00:04:45.450> potentially<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.900> little<00:04:46.110> bit<00:04:46.200> more

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
therefore potentially a little bit more

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.890 
therefore potentially a little bit more
speed<00:04:46.730> but<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:48.060> know<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.270> Phantom<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.690> not

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
speed but you know the Phantom is not

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.640 
speed but you know the Phantom is not
not<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> racer<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.960> anyway<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.530> that's

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
not a racer so but anyway so that's

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.640 
not a racer so but anyway so that's
that's<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.550> first<00:04:53.760> change<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:55.440> other

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
that's a the first change the other

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.560 
that's a the first change the other
change<00:04:56.160> if<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.490> go<00:04:56.610> into<00:04:56.730> advanced<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
change if you go into advanced is you

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.380 
change if you go into advanced is you
now<00:04:57.690> you've<00:04:57.870> now<00:04:58.020> got<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.470> few<00:04:58.950> little<00:04:59.760> option

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
now you've now got a few little option

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.420 
now you've now got a few little option

that's<00:05:20.730> how<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:21.650> intelligent

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
that's how you get intelligent

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.910 
that's how you get intelligent
orientation<00:05:23.250> control<00:05:26.030> other<00:05:27.030> than<00:05:27.180> that

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
orientation control other than that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.000 
orientation control other than that
everything<00:05:28.920> else<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:31.140> pretty<00:05:31.470> much<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
everything else you is pretty much the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.460 
everything else you is pretty much the
same<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:35.390> that's<00:05:36.390> how<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:36.690> do<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.290> as

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
same so that's how you do it it's as

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.800 
same so that's how you do it it's as
simple<00:05:37.620> as<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:39.030> but<00:05:39.240> as<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.390> said<00:05:39.630> it's

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
simple as that and it but as I said it's

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.860 
simple as that and it but as I said it's
also<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.950> finalized<00:05:41.790> thing<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.690> can

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
also not a finalized thing so you can

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.950 
also not a finalized thing so you can
always<00:05:43.440> change<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:44.100> back<00:05:44.280> again<00:05:44.550> if<00:05:44.730> you<00:05:44.960> don't

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
always change it back again if you don't

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
always change it back again if you don't
like<00:05:46.169> it<00:05:46.410> or<00:05:46.590> think<00:05:47.100> you've<00:05:47.250> made<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.430> terrible

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
like it or think you've made a terrible

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.280 
like it or think you've made a terrible
terrible<00:05:48.120> error<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:51.120> yeah<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.960> look<00:05:52.169> at

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
terrible error so yeah have a look at

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.430 
terrible error so yeah have a look at
that<00:05:52.410> if<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:52.860> if<00:05:53.190> you're<00:05:53.280> ready<00:05:53.460> for<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:54.440> it's

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
that if you if you're ready for it it's

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.810 
that if you if you're ready for it it's
as<00:05:55.620> simple<00:05:55.830> as<00:05:56.070> straightforward<00:05:56.340> as<00:05:56.610> that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
as simple as straightforward as that

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.060 
as simple as straightforward as that
that's<00:05:57.419> how<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.660> get<00:05:57.840> into<00:05:58.080> IOC<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.830> I'll

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
that's how you get into IOC and I'll

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.950 
that's how you get into IOC and I'll
maybe<00:05:59.400> doing<00:05:59.730> some<00:05:59.940> more<00:06:00.090> videos<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.780> into

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
maybe doing some more videos going into

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.170 
maybe doing some more videos going into
a<00:06:00.990> bit<00:06:01.110> more<00:06:01.140> detail<00:06:01.290> on<00:06:01.560> GPS<00:06:02.520> mode<00:06:02.730> versus<00:06:03.060> a

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
a bit more detail on GPS mode versus a

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.210 
a bit more detail on GPS mode versus a
tee<00:06:03.240> and<00:06:03.990> we<00:06:04.110> might<00:06:04.320> visit<00:06:04.350> home<00:06:04.860> lock<00:06:05.040> and

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
tee and we might visit home lock and

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.159 
tee and we might visit home lock and
course<00:06:05.400> lock<00:06:05.610> if<00:06:05.760> people<00:06:06.060> want<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.050> hope

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
course lock if people want to but I hope

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.600 
course lock if people want to but I hope
