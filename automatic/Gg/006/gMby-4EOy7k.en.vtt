 for samsung car that was offered to me 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.660
 by the site gsm 55 that I just 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:46.850
 test so first we will open 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:49.719
 the navigation application is for example 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.420
 the gps app 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.070

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.449

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.320
 car 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.509
 we had to fix about fifteen 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.170
 of seconds thanks to the settings that I 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.689
 you had explained in the previous 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.689

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.370
 hesitation on production 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.970
