00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
matte shade thing about this that you do

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.190 
matte shade thing about this that you do
have<00:02:37.609> to<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:37.819> careful<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:38.299> is<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.049> is

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have to be careful with is that it is

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.369 
have to be careful with is that it is
extremely<00:02:39.939> pigmented<00:02:40.939> I<00:02:41.150> mean<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.629> is<00:02:41.750> dark<00:02:42.139> so

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
extremely pigmented I mean it is dark so

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.569 
extremely pigmented I mean it is dark so
if<00:02:42.439> you<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.620> fair<00:02:42.799> skin<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:43.159> probably

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
if you have fair skin I probably

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.099 
if you have fair skin I probably
wouldn't<00:02:43.909> recommend<00:02:43.970> using<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.689> because<00:02:44.959> it

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
wouldn't recommend using this because it

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.170 
wouldn't recommend using this because it
is<00:02:45.230> really<00:02:45.739> dark<00:02:46.040> definitely<00:02:46.909> a<00:02:46.970> little<00:02:47.090> bit

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
is really dark definitely a little bit

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.030 
is really dark definitely a little bit
darker<00:02:47.569> than<00:02:47.689> the<00:02:47.810> NARS<00:02:47.989> Laguna<00:02:48.170> or<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.859> elf

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
darker than the NARS Laguna or the elf

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.610
