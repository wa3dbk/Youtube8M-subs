00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
tomorrow so there's actually a bad move

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.670 
tomorrow so there's actually a bad move
but<00:01:42.920> we're<00:01:43.039> going<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.490> resets<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.409> HP<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
but we're going to get resets in HP and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.719 
but we're going to get resets in HP and
prayer<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:46.430> i'm<00:01:46.579> pretty<00:01:47.570> sure<00:01:48.520> magic<00:01:49.520> won't

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
prayer but i'm pretty sure magic won't

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.870 
prayer but i'm pretty sure magic won't
be<00:01:49.969> reset<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.780> I'm<00:01:51.200> not<00:01:51.439> sure<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.979> hope<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.700> does

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
be reset it I'm not sure I hope it does
