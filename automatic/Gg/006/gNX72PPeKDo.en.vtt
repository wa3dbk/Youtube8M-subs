hello what I'm gonna do today is
demonstrate<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.590> use<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.940> switch<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.900> open

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
demonstrate how to use a switch to open

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
demonstrate how to use a switch to open
a<00:00:13.320> door<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.889> you'll<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> door<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
a door so you'll go up to a door and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.080 
a door so you'll go up to a door and
activate<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.049> it'll<00:00:16.680> say<00:00:16.940> restore<00:00:17.940> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
activate it it'll say restore that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.970 
activate it it'll say restore that
directed<00:00:18.359> elsewhere<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.560> you'll<00:00:19.859> have

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
directed elsewhere and then you'll have

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.490 
directed elsewhere and then you'll have
to<00:00:20.070> look<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.340> switch<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> open<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to look a little switch to open it so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.330 
to look a little switch to open it so
we're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> want<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> make<00:00:23.100> our<00:00:23.310> own

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
we're going to want to make our own

unique<00:00:24.000> door<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.260> begin<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:27.960> going

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
unique door to begin with so I'm going

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.689 
unique door to begin with so I'm going
to<00:00:28.140> make<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.670> i

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
to make it I think this is what i

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.340 
to make it I think this is what i
usually<00:00:29.910> use<00:00:30.090> yep<00:00:30.900> Madore<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> we'll<00:00:34.170> give<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
usually use yep Madore and we'll give it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.520 
usually use yep Madore and we'll give it
a<00:00:34.530> unique<00:00:34.829> ID<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.170> door<00:00:37.910> okay<00:00:39.050> yes<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
a unique ID so my door okay yes and so

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.760 
a unique ID so my door okay yes and so
now<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> write<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.370> script<00:00:42.770> script

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
now we're going to write a script script

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.139 
now we're going to write a script script
a<00:00:44.070> new<00:00:45.590> give<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> unique<00:00:46.890> ID<00:00:47.629> my<00:00:48.629> door<00:00:48.930> script

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
a new give a unique ID my door script

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
a new give a unique ID my door script
begin<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:53.000> activate<00:00:55.699> show<00:00:56.699> message<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.859> this

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
begin on activate show message and this

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
begin on activate show message and this
message<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> copied<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> over<00:01:00.510> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
message I put here I copied it over so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
message I put here I copied it over so
it<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:00.960> quite<00:01:01.050> longer<00:01:01.500> Colombo<00:01:01.800> typing<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it was quite longer Colombo typing it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
it was quite longer Colombo typing it
out<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> mistake<00:01:03.030> generic<00:01:03.989> door

out probably make a mistake generic door
activated<00:01:04.830> elsewhere<00:01:05.670> message<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
activated elsewhere message and so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480 
activated elsewhere message and so
that's<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> game<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.920> message<00:01:08.250> already

electric I don't get to choose this
electrical<00:02:14.959> switch<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.560> mean<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.430> could

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
electrical switch I mean really it could

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.630 
electrical switch I mean really it could
be<00:02:16.700> any<00:02:16.910> activator<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.080> wants<00:02:18.380> book<00:02:18.640> written

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
be any activator you wants book written

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.600 
be any activator you wants book written
is<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.850> switch<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.800> let's<00:02:21.800> switch<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.489> is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
is a switch so let's switch and this is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.430 
is a switch so let's switch and this is
a<00:02:25.640> generic<00:02:26.060> thing<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:27.080> see<00:02:27.200> there's<00:02:27.380> no

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
a generic thing can see there's no

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.920 
a generic thing can see there's no
script<00:02:28.340> attached<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.880> which<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.569> if<00:02:29.810> it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
script attached to it which is if it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.120 
script attached to it which is if it
does<00:02:30.049> have<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> script<00:02:30.410> attached<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.950> then

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
does have a script attached to it then

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.009 
does have a script attached to it then
you<00:02:31.850> probably<00:02:32.090> shouldn't<00:02:32.209> use<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.630> or<00:02:32.870> create

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
you probably shouldn't use it or create

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
I think a lot of vanilla doors using all

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.880 
I think a lot of vanilla doors using all
point<00:03:10.340> five<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.850> can<00:03:10.970> use<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.500> okay<00:03:12.500> and

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
point five so you can use that okay and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.360 
point five so you can use that okay and
hit<00:03:13.760> okay<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.470> blue<00:03:15.980> arrow<00:03:16.160> should

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370

appear<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:16.820> they<00:03:16.910> keep<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.150> did<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.359> right

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
appear then they keep you did it right

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.170 
appear then they keep you did it right
so<00:03:18.230> now<00:03:18.380> if<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.650> try<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.010> model<00:03:19.430> normally<00:03:19.850> but
