00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.340
 Hello guys 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.340
 the staff was fiddling with the computer 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.990
 business session to do some 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.100
 settings and and after starting the system 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 the same is caught 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.670
 I'm using Windows 7 that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.199
 happened person locked and in a system 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 I was not carrying 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.020
 I was forced to try to disconnect 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 through the pause button it does not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 the system works and does not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 there is one thing I do not recommend that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.070
 do and that was personal dead withdrawal 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.070
 I had to turn off a stabilizer. 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:03.619
 turn off the screen appears on the screen. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.220
 personal black does not start normally 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.689
 some advanced options and I came across 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.030
 with this screen dedicated step is 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.640
 system recovery 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.830
 if you do not turn on the person's machine 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.850
 only in the very last case did the car 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 there was no way 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.570
 unfortunately if you need to hang up 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 your machine you come across this land 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.520
 here it is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.189
 I'm using less 17 here is too much 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.110
 simple the person you see here 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.250
 school language is with the prosecutor 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 that of the month 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.930
 ok portuguese brasÃ­lia bnb two 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.250
 especially here you go in this 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.020
 ecosystem that will make people go 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.450
 make a repair, ok? 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.190
 despite the English here is doing is 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.340
 trying to recover the operating system 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.070
 here is nÃ© pee for no problems 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.110
 we are creating adilson problems and in 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.760
 many cases it is personal the system it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.780
 he gains success in recovery 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.239
 of systems 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.190
 unfortunately some more critical cases 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.690
 if this happens frequently 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.459
 many times you can not do 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 system operation 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.450
 so that's it, let's wait for the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.650
 system to make demand recovery a 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.519
 a little 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.090
 there're already back with the invitation to 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.090

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.710
 It's here for you and you start the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.990
 system to recover the 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.190
 here you can have a diagnosis you 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.830
 you can end 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.830
 I'll end it for an hour there. 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.990
 ae 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.569
 is a system're right 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.790
 This year I only do this with a lot of 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.060
 frequency is the system locking it 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.230
 it is not normal of the person this happens in 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.190
 various situations 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.290
 her first , not even 11 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.840
 the first of them happens a lot when the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.940
 that when you are having some 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.490
 problem of program concentration 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.570
 are programs that often cause 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.330
 compatibility with the system 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.920
 operational or personal problem 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.200
 're physical 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.760
 Who does not remember right there staff 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.530
 so if you come across the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:59.680
 situation and do it there personal beauty to 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.680
