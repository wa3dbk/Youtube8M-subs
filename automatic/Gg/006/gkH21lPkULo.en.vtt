00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.810
 a salute to the directors of tuttoandroid 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:13.930
 puntonet here from our hands ie lgl 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.470
 nice new ldl series device 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.910
 gip was here at berlin 2014 what 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.769
 wants to make lg.vo more than just the device 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.029
 practically bring some of the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.699
 features of the TV series in the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.769
 series , for example, starting from the keys 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.119
 maybe here as you see the council part 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.640
 of this device is almost entirely 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.160
 identical to electricity as you can 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.859
 see here from behind in that one 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.440
 position also the plot of the positive 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.230
 see the metallic texture is practically 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.760
 identical in the two device also prof 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.800
 I have a speaker and below a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 left 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.160
 regarding the features 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.140
 techniques of this of this device 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.410
 we have a 5 inch display with 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.030
 resolution fwb cia of type ips of 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.370
 processor inside is a quad core 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 mediatek 1.3 gigahertz that makes her 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.290
 all quite well as you see the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.430
 the interface also very very fast 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.010
 otherwise we find a camera 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.450
 1 megapixel front that can here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.280
 in the mad at the top right after 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.800
 speaker together at the bottom of course 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 we do not find physical keys in soft touch 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.740
 my thoughts are all software 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.290
 clearly customizable in the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.970
 lg optimization software 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.090
 edges and good obviously not at the levels 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.950
 of g3 but to be a profile of 5 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.330
 inches is not very large in the part 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.130
 back we said we find the two 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.500
 volume keys between selections of the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.050
 experiment the back camera 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.430
 from 8 megapixels with LED flash and the act 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.290
 caregiver below left 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.420
 the cover is clearly removable 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.640
 in fact it is the part of a battery yes 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 can change and memory can be 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.900
 eventually expanded with a micro sd 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.890
 in fact the internal memory is 8 gb and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.020
 the battery instead the 2540 software is 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.729
 almost completely ineffective or better 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.750
 many parades of living flowers are part 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.970
 practically the same 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.260
 the android lessinia which is based on 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.530
 device 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.640
 to see it was 4.4 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.150
 2 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 as truth 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.070
 for the rest, for example, maybe we do 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 around in the settings we find 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.080
 also here the smart planning as like g3 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.730
 some gestures for turning on and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.900
 turn off I explain shield time with 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.900
 he double after with a food 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.680
 also optimize operations with one 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.790
 mom who carelessly 5 wants the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.500
 give this anyway 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 functionality within the software 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.380
 and there is also the customizable keyboard 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.180
 as we saw on the new one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.400
 ldc version 26 tg3 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.080
 etcetera etc. what to say about this 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.250
 rialzo will arrive in Italy starting from 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.110
 October 2000 14x at a price that lg 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.670
 said to be that within 200 euros 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.270
 so a very low price for 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.290
 I would say this type of band very much 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.390
 interesting we hope to have it in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.980
 possible technique to make them due 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.490
 considerations and a review 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.500
 complete 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.140
 last thing the camera even from the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.190
 software point of view is identical to lg 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 we also find the recognition 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.660
 and hand to take times like 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.960
 you see 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.700
 here then 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.100
 so that is for the moment everything from with 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.870
 lgl beautiful from the elegia stand of 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.860
 someone from berlin d'emanuele capone 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.860
