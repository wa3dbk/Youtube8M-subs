00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.450
 decorate dragon ball z without budokai 1 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.440
 unlocked 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.440
 first of all there will be three 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.560
 files on the link going to the 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:29.060
 description of the video below 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.060
 one is the emulator that they will need 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.530
 what is this that they have like four 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.090
 containment arrows center which is the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.530
 fsp emulator that is what they are going to 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.560
 do ok 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.900
 after the file that is the game a 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.380
 file that says point file is dragon 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.680
 ball z involves us how much did 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.830
 the third and last is the cow the data 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.450
 is what contains the people that already 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.450
 unlocked in a top story 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.379
 here good that nothing install the emulator 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.780
 install analyst give in fact not what 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.780
 do still good 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:13.210
 well here they go 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 I'm going to go out in a folder called 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.480
 and now he's going to have some antics 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.850
 prices these are smelled and several moments 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.350
 I'm not sure the folder so 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.420
 if we do it 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.090
 they're just going to decompress they 're going to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.189
 open the folder there I do not know which thief 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.950
 it must be here 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.390
 well here is this is the dragon 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 ball 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.350
 in these four files and this is the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.350
 binder 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.490
 in this nation 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.369
 It's about you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.979
 date and here is the file when they go to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.170
 unzip the file will come out 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 this just give him copy they go to the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.790
 folder is about pcpi that is going to 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.759
 create to be in the emulator in this 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.099
 folder and good and they stick it and anahí and there 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.700
 it would already be everything that would be characters 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.129
 Y 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.870
 game mode any case of 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.879
 download and in what is the game itself 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.640
 dragonball that thought of around 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.010
 180 being moment I'm not sure that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.240
 be here is but both venues and the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.650
 lunar set so and good to see 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.110
 how much weight exactly properties 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.670
 I already wanted 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 191 point 31 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.400
 good little bit more 180 but it's not very 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.830
 heavy the good game will come out well this one 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.840
 you can move the game any 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.780
 folder nothing else they know where 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.670
 is I left the pcpe not to lose 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.250
 the responsibility good let's go back 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.700
 now if we open the protected emulator 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 says pspv this would be opening then 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.860
 sometimes it 's a bit slow spsp and gpl 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.720
 board 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.940
 although at the beginning you are not going to 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.770
 appear here president is obvious good 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.000
 at the beginning to a company that tells me 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.210
 of all or that upon request to card 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.440
 external or sd 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.910
 it's going to look like this your entire folder 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.150
 well I search in a folder a 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 caloría esp and here is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.110
 dragon ball and they give him 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.350
 this band and that is the company that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.280
 manufactures these two and when I'm going to 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.280
 be to accelerate this 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.640
 the volume proton cruising 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.200
 it was consumed listening to such could 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.200
 appreciate being provocative 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.300
 Ok here 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.440
 and we go back 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.380
 good things that are going to choose a single 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.720
 they prefer that they have to be already 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.720
 little subject let's go 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.860
 as you will see the cit if we had not 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.400
 unloaded the robe this one night it seems 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.079
 each other and I have the next super 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:25.900
 president is everything I also have this 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.900
 what is jean female this one 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.630
 it would take a lot and life then 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.760
 it would be all good for them to see that if 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.760
 well after 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.639
 of the masses and consumption 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.129
 we erase tusk in innovation 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.569
 this is fine but sometimes and cell phones 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.199
 of high-end mid-range are going to 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.250
 lock a bit and good to fix that 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.319
 we read here where it says in 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.590
 configurations simply demos carla 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.590
 behind 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.220
 what they have to give in 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.810
 settings and here in jumping boxes 2 you 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.440
 they put it a third they see that we're 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.630
 here in 600 here processed clarified the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.740
 first the configuration was already of 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.810
 questioning of nation for playing here 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.460
 resolution I have it in two is because 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.470
 it looks good and it does not get stuck but of the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.810
 three and you work more advertises uses the 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.889
 one 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.770
 here after here do not give good give 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.580
 to activate nor maps transformation by 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.100
 software skin by software all up 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.030
 deactivate slower effects all everything 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:57.490
 and then in texture filters 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.530
 they will give you in linear 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.350
 screen scaling filter also 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.590
 linear and here everything 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.510
 50 this if they leave it as everything comes 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.460
 here and here if you want to know the 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.040
 speed that will be executed 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.280
 they put both because what he says 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.160
 information on the screen we go back and 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.370
 this good thing would appear to them more or less 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.350
 information 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.620
 this is so that they can analyze the 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.490
 no broths here 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:31.270
 here according to this 99,100 percent and 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.910
 I said good this would be everything is my first 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.230
 channel video so like 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.230
 subscribe cya I will be uploading 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:43.370
 videos very often and this would be all 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.370
 until next time
