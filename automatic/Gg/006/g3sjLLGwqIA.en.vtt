00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.689
 thomas at the moment it can actually 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.790
 only go uphill and in the direction of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.350
 spring meteorological is there 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.460
 even when the weather was still noticeable today 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 nothing at all 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 a high is at the moment west of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.549
 us and that is quite changeable 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
 but this high pulls in the next 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.660
 days continue to turn east 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 it still neat and the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 Air masses turn in a clockwise direction 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 around a high and you can see the air 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.820
 then come to us comes directly from 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.939
 southwest and that means sunday monday 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.769
 perhaps it might be even 15 degrees 16 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 is not quite so far at the moment 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.350
 for sure 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.880
 if you look at the trend for Cologne 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.559
 here this gray area is the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.379
 uncertainty but are pretty sure 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 ever so around 14 degrees 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 Maybe it will even start the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.829
 next week the end of this week 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.079
 a bit warmer then you would 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.980
 really so right 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.500
 Spring feelings get what that too 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 At the moment we have it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 still to do with the wintry weather 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 gray blizzard lightning thunder snow 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 above about 400 to 600 meters 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 partly strong shudder presses it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.369
 the snowfall but also further 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 Down to it there are above all things from 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.780
 Lower Saxony via Saxony-Anhalt to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.030
 to brandenburg locally still stormy 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 isolated even heavy storm gusts and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 it can be smooth tomorrow everywhere 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 roads are wet and the temperatures 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 usually go back to values ​​around 0 degrees 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 Soil on the ground 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 be careful tomorrow 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.590
 first a friendly start 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.119
 last shudder is behind it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 relaxes often give up sunshine 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020
 from northwest comes then new rain in the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.909
 Run back in the afternoon 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.909
 showers with gravel locally with snow 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.220
 above 500 to 700 meters in the south 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 By contrast, sunny and the temperatures 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 rise during the afternoon 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.790
 five to ten degrees 12 13 degrees would be 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.619
 even in Baden-Wuerttemberg with 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.360
 sun and the wind can be felt everywhere 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.100
 that comes the western directions 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 especially in the north is the fresh 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 on the way in gusts even stronger 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 wednesday then again such a typical 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.100
 chill weather thunder storm 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.229
 it is most dry in the east and am 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 Thursday then slow weather calming 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.320
 So it goes in the direction of uphill in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 direction spring
