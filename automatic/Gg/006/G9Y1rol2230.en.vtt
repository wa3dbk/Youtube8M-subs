I'd<00:00:03.120> like<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.389> talk<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.659> Kermit<00:00:03.959> chromatic

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
I'd like to talk about Kermit chromatic

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.099 
I'd like to talk about Kermit chromatic
scale<00:00:05.480> chromatic<00:00:06.480> scale<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.810> just<00:00:06.960> whenever

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
scale chromatic scale is just whenever

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.190 
scale chromatic scale is just whenever
you<00:00:07.290> play<00:00:07.440> each<00:00:08.130> note<00:00:08.809> you're<00:00:09.809> not<00:00:09.929> worried

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
you play each note you're not worried

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.360 
you play each note you're not worried
about<00:00:10.260> necessarily<00:00:10.559> halves<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.280> wholes

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
about necessarily halves and wholes

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.770 
about necessarily halves and wholes
everything<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.120> all<00:00:12.330> everything's<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
everything it's just all everything's a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.660 
everything it's just all everything's a
half<00:00:12.929> step<00:00:13.139> away<00:00:13.290> from<00:00:13.440> each<00:00:13.679> other<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.040> it's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
half step away from each other and it's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.740 
half step away from each other and it's
just<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.990> note<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.440> next<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
just going up one note to the next and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
just going up one note to the next and
it's<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:18.930> much<00:00:19.050> used<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.980> jazz<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.550> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it's pretty much used in jazz a lot to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
it's pretty much used in jazz a lot to
transition<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.960> good<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
transition it's just good to know how to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.980 
transition it's just good to know how to
do<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> full<00:00:23.130> chromatic<00:00:23.580> scale<00:00:23.820> gives<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.869> an

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
do a full chromatic scale gives you an

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
do a full chromatic scale gives you an
idea<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> notes<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.840> here's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
idea of where the notes are so here's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.029 
idea of where the notes are so here's
the<00:00:28.019> scale<00:00:28.260> we're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the scale we're going to do it in the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.130 
the scale we're going to do it in the
key<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> C

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:47.150 

you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.950 

so<00:00:48.160> what<00:00:48.670> we're<00:00:48.820> doing<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:49.210> we're<00:00:49.390> just<00:00:49.420> taking

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
so what we're doing is we're just taking

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.270 
so what we're doing is we're just taking
four<00:00:50.410> notes<00:00:50.620> per<00:00:50.829> string<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.140> we're<00:00:54.070> moving

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
four notes per string and we're moving

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
four notes per string and we're moving
it<00:00:54.640> down<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.300> string<00:00:55.809> set<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.320> over<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.860> fret<00:00:57.190> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it down a string set and over a fret and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.479 
it down a string set and over a fret and
that's<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.440> way<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.650> goes<00:00:59.710> for<00:01:00.040> most<00:01:00.220> of<00:01:00.370> it

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
that's the way it goes for most of it

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.430 
that's the way it goes for most of it
until<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.730> get<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:00.940> g<00:01:01.180> string<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.720> then

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
until you get to the g string and then

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.189 
until you get to the g string and then
well<00:01:03.129> let<00:01:03.220> me<00:01:03.309> show<00:01:03.339> you<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:04.089> slowly<00:01:04.809> we're

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
well let me show you so slowly we're

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.580 
well let me show you so slowly we're
just<00:01:05.259> going<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.500> go<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:08.350> we're<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.530> to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
just going to go now we're going to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.590 
just going to go now we're going to
shift<00:01:08.860> down<00:01:09.190> string<00:01:09.670> set<00:01:09.910> over<00:01:10.330> one<00:01:12.600> same

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
shift down string set over one same

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.270 
shift down string set over one same
thing<00:01:13.930> string<00:01:14.530> set<00:01:14.770> over<00:01:15.160> fret<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> same

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
thing string set over fret then the same

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
thing string set over fret then the same
thing<00:01:18.550> down<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> string<00:01:19.270> set<00:01:19.450> over<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> fret

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thing down the string set over a fret

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.600 
thing down the string set over a fret
now<00:01:23.080> whenever<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.470> get<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.770> g<00:01:23.950> string<00:01:24.250> or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
now whenever you get to the g string or

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520 
now whenever you get to the g string or
and<00:01:25.060> transitioning<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.930> b<00:01:26.110> string<00:01:26.170> you're

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
and transitioning to the b string you're

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.950 
and transitioning to the b string you're
going<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:26.710> say<00:01:26.890> stay<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:28.450> same<00:01:28.660> fret

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
going to say stay on the same fret

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.139 
going to say stay on the same fret
marker<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.619> instead<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.460> going<00:01:30.610> down<00:01:30.850> one<00:01:31.060> is

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
marker so instead of going down one is

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.440 
marker so instead of going down one is
just<00:01:31.270> going<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.450> be<00:01:31.539> parallel<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:32.440> itself<00:01:32.740> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.550 

and<00:01:37.450> whenever<00:01:37.600> you're<00:01:37.840> transitioning<00:01:38.200> from

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
and whenever you're transitioning from

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.710 
and whenever you're transitioning from
the<00:01:38.740> B<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.220> e<00:01:39.280> you're<00:01:40.210> going<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.390> go<00:01:40.509> down

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the B to the e you're going to go down

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.910 
the B to the e you're going to go down
and<00:01:40.869> swing<00:01:40.960> set<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.259> over<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.740> fret<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.509> then

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and swing set and over a fret and then

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.180 
and swing set and over a fret and then
resolve<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.550> root<00:01:46.509> note<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.899> see<00:01:47.550> in<00:01:50.190> way

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
resolve on the root note of see in way

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.589 
resolve on the root note of see in way
this<00:01:51.399> helps<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.149> whenever<00:01:52.330> you're

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
this helps is that whenever you're

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.020 
this helps is that whenever you're
playing<00:01:53.009> chromatic<00:01:54.009> scale<00:01:54.190> not<00:01:54.550> only<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:55.000> it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
playing chromatic scale not only is it

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.919 
playing chromatic scale not only is it
something<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.360> can<00:01:55.450> play<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.810> it's

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
something you can play but it's

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.990 
something you can play but it's
something<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.410> can<00:01:56.590> use<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.000> teach

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
something that you can use to teach

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240 
something that you can use to teach
yourself<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.599> names<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:59.020> notes<00:01:59.259> you<00:02:00.039> know<00:02:00.160> you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
yourself the names of notes you know you

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:09.570 
yourself the names of notes you know you
know<00:02:00.489> you<00:02:00.520> start<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.569> C<00:02:02.610> C<00:02:03.610> sharp<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.369> on

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
know you start on C C sharp and so on

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.020 
know you start on C C sharp and so on
and<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:09.849> forth<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.370> also<00:02:12.459> play<00:02:12.849> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and so forth and you can also play it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690 
and so forth and you can also play it
the<00:02:13.150> other<00:02:13.270> way<00:02:13.360> around<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.459> start<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
the other way around so start on the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780 
the other way around so start on the
high<00:02:15.880> sea<00:02:17.130> let's<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.280> play<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.459> backwards

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
high sea let's just play it backwards

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
high sea let's just play it backwards
now<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> same<00:02:21.340> idea<00:02:21.849> only<00:02:22.239> you're

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
now this is the same idea only you're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.199 
now this is the same idea only you're
going<00:02:23.319> up<00:02:23.500> string<00:02:23.830> sets<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.370> over<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.879> fret

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
going up string sets and over a fret

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:41.150 
going up string sets and over a fret
this<00:02:25.629> way<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.080> is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.900 

and<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.950> same<00:02:44.130> thing<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.550> G<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.790> B

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and the same thing with the G and B

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.270 
and the same thing with the G and B
transition<00:02:45.660> whenever<00:02:46.590> you're<00:02:46.740> on<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> G<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
transition whenever you're on the G and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
transition whenever you're on the G and
the<00:02:47.340> B<00:02:47.370> string<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.390> want<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.660> remind<00:02:49.260> yourself

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the B string you want to remind yourself

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.060 
the B string you want to remind yourself
to<00:02:49.830> stay<00:02:50.250> parallel<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.710> like<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.800> said<00:02:52.860> it's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
to stay parallel and like I said it's

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.980 
to stay parallel and like I said it's
the<00:02:53.130> same<00:02:53.310> idea<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:53.940> goes<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.330> way<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.900> then

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the same idea one goes this way and then

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.450 
the same idea one goes this way and then
the<00:02:55.020> other<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.320> goes<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.310> all

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
the other one goes this way it's all

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.940 
the other one goes this way it's all
angular<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.540> chromatic<00:02:58.320> scale<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> good<00:02:58.800> way

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
angular so chromatic scale is a good way

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.800 
angular so chromatic scale is a good way
to<00:02:59.010> transition<00:02:59.760> yourself<00:03:00.270> into<00:03:00.600> another

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to transition yourself into another

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.650 
to transition yourself into another
piece<00:03:01.020> say<00:03:01.230> you're<00:03:01.410> playing<00:03:02.480> you're<00:03:03.480> just

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
piece say you're playing you're just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.720 
piece say you're playing you're just
playing<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.020> sea<00:03:04.200> pentatonic<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:05.550> want

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
playing in a sea pentatonic but you want

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.670 
playing in a sea pentatonic but you want
to<00:03:05.760> get<00:03:05.910> up<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> note<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:07.080> want<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.380> do

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
to get up to a note and you want to do

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.950 
to get up to a note and you want to do
it<00:03:07.800> instead<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.670> playing<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.500> always<00:03:10.740> do

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
it instead of playing you can always do

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.620 
it instead of playing you can always do
it's<00:03:12.960> just<00:03:14.030> using<00:03:15.030> those<00:03:15.150> notes<00:03:15.450> as

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it's just using those notes as

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's just using those notes as
transition<00:03:16.170> notes<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> good<00:03:16.830> way<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.180> make

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
transition notes is a good way to make

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.820 
transition notes is a good way to make
your<00:03:18.330> playing<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:18.990> bit<00:03:19.140> more<00:03:19.560> lively

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
your playing a little bit more lively

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.950 
your playing a little bit more lively
and<00:03:20.430> gives<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.180> bit<00:03:21.300> more<00:03:21.450> options

and gives you a little bit more options

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.980 
and gives you a little bit more options
whenever<00:03:22.290> you're<00:03:22.470> playing<00:03:22.710> so
