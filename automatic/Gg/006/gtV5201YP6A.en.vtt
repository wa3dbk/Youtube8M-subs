00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.670
 we do not have here this tablet has arrived 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.580
 this tablet because 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.639
 our tablet that we have here is 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.300
 burned propeller power because the customer 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.150
 put a charger for a mini pc 16 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.630
 volts and this exploded and you can this one 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.610
 and is not trying to give you solution 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.180
 had taken out sony ericsson to a 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.910
 Android phone but it did not work but 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.800
 now yes and get the power 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.030
 that it was the same one who brought the phone 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.350
 a xp 209 and we're going to proceed to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.740
 replace it there we see that he brings his 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.620
 the numbering of the pins 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.870
 and with it we will guide ourselves to be able 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.120
 give you the guide here we also see a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.580
 circle and here we see the circle in the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.010
 circuit indicating what the position is 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.470
 from that I did power 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.200
 here we see that they bring the same ends 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.120
 brings the same goals and the same guide 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.120
 for this sector that has the circle 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.050
 from 48 pins 12 per side we're going to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 proceed then to change that end and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.130
 for this we are going to protect in this case 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.430
 all this work so that the connectors 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 do not get damaged with aluminum foil and we're going to 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.840
 leave only the area where the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.690
 circuit we are also going to do with 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.450
 when I'm going to apply flush 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.380
 he says this says it was a cell phone 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.230
 that try 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.570
 to experiment to see yes 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.659
 If I could give a solution but I had not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.789
 served 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.789
 and this I'm just going to take it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 and we see that all the lines are 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.230
 still perfectly fine 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.470
 and now we are going to proceed to then 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.470
 when removing this 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.640
 we see that we have withdrawn it and we have 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.580
 that we remember the guide and we have the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 dot to the guide 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.780
 let's proceed to the person to release it 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.590
 in the other one 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.590
 in the other war 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440
 circuit 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.020
 the circuit guide 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.020
 simply missing 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.020
 align it 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.209
 well aligned let's go to the station and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.209
 let's start with circles 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.300
 I'm going to do a little bit of pressure towards 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.349
 and now I'm going to increase a little bit 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.430
 air I am changing this says from 420 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.100
 at 440 degrees 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.720
 I'm touching it 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.800
 to try 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.800
 it's like giving 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.370
 and we put pressure 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.580
 let's review the teacher nancy me what 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.980
 we do detailed and yes yes we 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.890
 missed we solve it again 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.260
 but here we already have the tablet mounted 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.930
 of this tablet carries ions without understanding 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.400
 because we do not consider propeller power and 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.350
 let's see that this is what I am 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.190
 feeding here with the power source 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.790
 or with any battery 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.560
 we'll see 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.910
 of the tablet turned on again 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.910
 we usually see it 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.860
 after us having changed this 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:35.360
 was once this winner with the chip at 13 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.249
 that we have been working perfectly 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.210
 let's wait for it to turn on and we're going to 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.919
 watch 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.400
 well here we see the tablet 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.250
 running on normally is 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.690
 there we can see afterwards that 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.690
 we change this says of power 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.250
 we have been able to solve 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.680
 to this to this fault I had state 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.890
 wait very soon for the full course 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.110
 tablets where we will learn how to know 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.030
 which circuits are failing when not 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.100
 turn on and know all the 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.290
 operation and recognize each of 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.270
 the parts says power the processor 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.730
 the transistors the diodes of these 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.500
 devices and be able to learn them to 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.960
 repair service arauca to service 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.740
 professional technician in mobile telephony and 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.740
 mobile devices
