00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.260
 hello good friends as you already read the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.430
 title this is a tutorial to use the 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:16.960
 gamepad eluded as a joystick for the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:20.050
 pc and use it in games of whatever 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.580
 it's too simple this is the only thing 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 have to do is download files 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 and the only thing we're going to need is this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.950
 file that is here in which it is called 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 susan and that this investment 0 points 0.3 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.550
 they download it and I already have it and it's going to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 give this 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.060
 then they open it 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.580
 and inside it will contain three lm files 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.810
 a folder that says 64 bits and another 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.660
 that says 32 parts 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.000
 ok we are going to use the one that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.220
 our computer uses to know 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.810
 if the treatment of 64 we are going to 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.350
 start 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.220
 as a team we right click and put 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 in properties 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 we go down a bit and that's where it says 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.560
 system type operating system where 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 32 bars 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 mine is a mini laptop so it's from 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.330
 32 you search and 764 use the 64 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.130
 ok according to what they have they are going to 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.130
 drag to the desktop 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.890
 or fifth you can close this and you 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.890
 they leave a folder like this they open it 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.990
 and will come an excel file or 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 application like this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.549
 then we double click 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.370
 we wait for it to open 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.080
 the truth does not weigh much regret created 20 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.700
 megas or something 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.700
 then wait for them to open 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 and it's going to give you something like this 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.140
 ok once you have it here 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.360
 let's learn the erwin gamepad 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 so 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.230
 maybe we 'll let them show you how 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.230
 come out in peace 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.770
 ok once here 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.660
 since we have felt our compass 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.240
 we are going to bite him 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.020
 to the start button that is here 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.020
 we create 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.480
 we wait for him to load 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.930
 we give them a warning to appear 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.920
 firewall but we are going to give 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.520
 Allow access 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.520
 okay 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.360
 we wait a moment 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.750
 ok, give us a url, then let's go 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.710
 copy this 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.670
 this page that left us this url 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.670
 we copy it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.730
 and we're going to paste it into the browser that 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.909
 let's use 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.960
 in this case I use the chrome and we're going 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.880
 paste 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.880
 we give him enter 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.890
 and it will load a bit 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.520
 another thing to use this need to have 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.099
 connected the computer and the egg to the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.220
 same internet connection what is going 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.170
 to look like pure letters 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.239
 Yes this 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.790
 and we are going to copy the same url in the 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.030
 impasse of the wii the truth I explain 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.030
 how 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.810
 okay 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.840
 here we're going to go to the browser 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.840
 Internet 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:48.310
 and we are going to copy here 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.860
 the same URL that left us here 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.860
 and then let's put 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 192 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.360
 point 168 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 point 1 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.460
 point 77 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.080
 because I have it, I can not reach 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.080
 see there is and we will give the ready 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.590
 will take us to a blank page and 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.060
 So what are we going to do? 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.360
 press the lupita that is here in 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.360
 corner 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.289
 and here we are going to 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.960
 be using 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:35.399
 this means if I move for example this 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.629
 button to shore here to do so close 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.629
 all the buttons 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.770
 social cancel for example is 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.930
 pressing x and here the x moves 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.150
 and I do not have any kind of connected 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.150
 more cable than this which is the mouse 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:57.330
 and that's how this works 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:00.180
 pressure is not back 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.569
 and if I kiss the press of three and 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.569
 move 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.469
 yes all the buttons 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.250
 ok then 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.330
 after this I will show you how 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.330
 It can also be used 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.100
