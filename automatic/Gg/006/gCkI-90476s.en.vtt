00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.359
 hello friends how are you happy who 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.180
 teach how to make this beautiful bedroom 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.450
 with a frozen theme but still 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.450
 puts any Mexican I'm 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.990
 using divide that then only leaves 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.189
 of foami paper and some boxes that no longer 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.580
 they serve us a glue the fabric nothing 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.100
 to sew very easy and as you can see it was very 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.620
 nice let's watch the video 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.420
 very well I will need a box of 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.860
 cookies that have more or less 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.170
 let your wrist be ok sheets of paper 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.179
 foam and I am using it with 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 diamond but it can be white 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:51.020
 little buttons 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.610
 this may be optional 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.130
 glue tape 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.870
 and I'm going to use this bar as 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:07.430
 This decoration can go or not you will see 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.950
 and I'm going to use some water caps 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.850
 those 20 liters so that my bed does not 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.350
 it's so short this can also be 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.710
 optional ok I'll occupy a cardboard 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.230
 that I read and the way 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.340
 to a sheet 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.609
 I gave him the circular form 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.619
 and then I passed it on cardboard and then what 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:37.569
 I'm forming with the same time 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.329
 it's very easy then economical since I 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.539
 they said nothing about fabric just paper and 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.329
 forming so you will see what it is is very 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.850
 Well, well, here I already have it well 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.409
 lined can do it on this side 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.310
 also or leave them cake and we will form 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.399
 also our cure good before this 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.100
 to form it we are going to mark this part 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.810
 from above in report 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 that is not of month before 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.690
 and we will contribute as we have it 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.990
 let's cut an inch in this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.990
 side 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.150
 well and we're going to remove it from the can 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 to another centimeter 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.780
 i 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 and then we divide it into two parts 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 there has to be something like that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.660
 well let's delete it so they see is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.660
 the next step 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.810
 since we have it like this we are going to place 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 our little foami bits of this 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.120
 shape and over the buttons we're going to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.790
 hit with 5 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.569
 no good I here I have my gurus min is 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.480
 so they generate me 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.920
 very nice truth 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.230
 and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.230
 also for laughing and box 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.040
 with sheets of paper that you do 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.459
 they want they can erase all the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.459
 straps 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.790
 Well this plant 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.790
 let's join 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.710
 down the hard ones then I'm going to 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.400
 place in this part of chairs so that 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.879
 I stayed a little higher 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.689
 very well what here is already pressing this pasta and 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.689
 already a little bit higher is never the 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:17.820
 let's book here with one and we're going to 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:22.760
 make is a bigger one with the family 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.390
 the same as it is a cigar 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.650
 I cut a rectangle measuring in 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:35.890
 more or less the width of change and level 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.890
 25 centimeters this security measure 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.860
 we will not discriminate 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.070
 and then I joined this part that you see 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 3 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:26.650
 and we will reign 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.580

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.970
 the eyes 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.880
 It seems 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.880
 and I'm going to close these weapons 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:58.009
 then more if you want more 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:02.590

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.830

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.650
 they are pure 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.500
