00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
jellyfish like charging station so it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.310 
jellyfish like charging station so it's
just<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> little<00:03:53.360> shebang<00:03:54.360> right<00:03:55.019> here

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
just like a little shebang right here

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.710 
just like a little shebang right here
and<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.680> just<00:03:55.709> plug<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.690> can

last month stuff so I thought it'd be
beneficial<00:04:12.540> just<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.590> show<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.280> pictures<00:04:14.910> of
