is going down speed a lot of pokemon and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
is going down speed a lot of pokemon and
85<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.539> boost<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.140> certain

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
85 you know we can boost that in certain

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.870 
85 you know we can boost that in certain
ways<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.710> we'll<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.580> ends<00:00:26.789> up

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
ways and we'll see how this one ends up

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.179 
ways and we'll see how this one ends up
going<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> worst<00:00:28.260> pokemon<00:00:28.740> but

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
going up so not the worst pokemon but

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
going up so not the worst pokemon but
just<00:00:29.580> looking<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> surface<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> also

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
just looking at on the surface it also

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.600 
just looking at on the surface it also
kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> seems<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.529> talonflame<00:00:32.099> light

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
kind of seems like a talonflame light

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
kind of seems like a talonflame light
that<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.870> slower<00:00:34.140> than

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that you're a little slower than

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
that you're a little slower than
talonflame<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.190> doesn't<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> gale<00:00:35.820> wings<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
talonflame it doesn't have gale wings so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.850 
talonflame it doesn't have gale wings so
we're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> differences

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
we're going to see like the differences

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
we're going to see like the differences
in<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.100> pokemon<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.610> well<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> normal

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
in this pokemon has well it's a normal

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
in this pokemon has well it's a normal
flying<00:00:39.930> type<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.680> we're<00:00:40.770> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
flying type so we're kind of going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
flying type so we're kind of going to
see<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> ground<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> ghost<00:00:42.239> immunities<00:00:42.719> as

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
see the ground and ghost immunities as

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
see the ground and ghost immunities as
well<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.290> weaknesses<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> rock<00:00:44.190> electric<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

well as weaknesses to rock electric and
ice<00:00:44.850> no<00:00:45.450> four<00:00:45.690> times<00:00:45.809> weakness<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> rock<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
ice no four times weakness to rock so I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
ice no four times weakness to rock so I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
base 85 attack that damage is going to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350

can<00:01:37.110> carry<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.619> turn<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.880> have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
can carry you turn but also you do have

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
can carry you turn but also you do have
a<00:01:39.090> lot<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> other<00:01:39.509> options<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.079> quick<00:01:40.259> attack

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a lot of other options like quick attack

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
a lot of other options like quick attack
quick<00:01:41.040> attack<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> follow<00:01:42.180> up

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
quick attack is good for that follow up

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
quick attack is good for that follow up
that<00:01:43.049> facade<00:01:43.380> doesn't<00:01:43.710> KO<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.430> feel<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that facade doesn't KO and you feel the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.429 
that facade doesn't KO and you feel the
opponent<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.119> priority<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.930> quick<00:01:46.140> attack

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
opponent has priority and quick attack

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.899 
opponent has priority and quick attack
in<00:01:46.649> between<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> side<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> quick<00:01:47.640> attack

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
in between the side and quick attack

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
in between the side and quick attack
that's<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.630> enough<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> KO<00:01:49.140> most

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that's going to be enough to KO most

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
that's going to be enough to KO most

really see swellow too much you get a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
really see swellow too much you get a
little<00:02:51.180> less<00:02:51.300> attack<00:02:51.630> put<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.020> little<00:02:52.200> more

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320
