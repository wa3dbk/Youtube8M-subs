00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.239
 good evening continue 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.099
 our work 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.229
 third time gadzhi muslimovic gadzhiev 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.380
 Main coach 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.189
 Anzhi teams from Makhachkala 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.210
 even considering the growth to spend your 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 comment who else 4 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.829
 Gazprom will be a short Spartak was 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.470
 a little faster 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 some top players at the top 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.100
 especially within 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.180
 close to our gate 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.210
 in Europe 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.450
 I think I will not say everything on the field 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 it is generally necessary faster than 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.150
 our fields 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.060
 but this is not the most 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.620
 m 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.000
 in the second play-off match 1 4 finals 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.010
 tournament in hamburg dear 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.590
 but I heard the story 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 he can play harder he will 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 play harder 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.360
 perhaps another question 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.190
 of this case 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.909
 I can hear it even without a microphone, archaeologists 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.780
 we were going to spend Spartak 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.990
 due to what 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.630
 except that we know well on this game 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 rare aero of this command 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.130
 thanks to this Spartacus today 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.750
 it was a good game 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.120
 on board with us 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.580
 I can not say what happened that I 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.250
 good but we are not just because 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.200
 let's say there were some rough 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 mistakes that led to freebies 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.380
 missed goal 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.820
 rubles stressed be realized 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.770
 what he 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.830
 could not 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 but not in terms of what we created there 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.340
 prudnikova moment I'm not talking about that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.600
 he didn't score 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.130
 p we could have sowing more 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.569
 people approaches 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.629
 smile gate 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.629
 Spartak and we had the prerequisites for this 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.279
 Here in this part we played 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.919
 seem to be 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.919
 due to the fact that in the middle line we have 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.109
 Well, it was not 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.819
 Well, that is the accuracy that in these 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.449
 situations need
