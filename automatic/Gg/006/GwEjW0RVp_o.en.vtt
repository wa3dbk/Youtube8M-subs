00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you can see the resolution and 552

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.459 
you can see the resolution and 552
that's<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.760> my<00:00:50.789> resolution<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:51.960> pro<00:00:52.199> tab

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that's what my resolution on my pro tab

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
that's what my resolution on my pro tab
to<00:00:53.129> XXL<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:56.239> save<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:58.309> rename<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.640> old<00:00:59.820> boot

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to XXL is so save it rename the old boot

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
to XXL is so save it rename the old boot
animation<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:03.180> something<00:01:03.539> else<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.309> then

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
animation to something else and then

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.870 
animation to something else and then
repack<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> files<00:01:06.500> using<00:01:07.500> winrar<00:01:10.670> choose<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
repack the files using winrar choose the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
repack the files using winrar choose the
zip<00:01:12.090> format<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.140> important<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> even<00:01:14.159> more

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
zip format it's important and even more

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.899 
zip format it's important and even more
important<00:01:15.060> maybe<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.020> store<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> compression

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
important maybe is store the compression

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.149 
important maybe is store the compression
method<00:01:18.270> needs<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> storm<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> no

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
method needs to be storm so there is no

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.960 
method needs to be storm so there is no
compression<00:01:20.960> whatsoever<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:25.790> rename<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
compression whatsoever then rename it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690 
compression whatsoever then rename it
back<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> boot<00:01:27.450> animation<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.979> SD<00:01:29.340> put

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
back to boot animation put it on SD put

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
back to boot animation put it on SD put

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
partition so we use root explorer for

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
partition so we use root explorer for
that<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> top<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.090> can't<00:02:15.450> read<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:15.989> it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.330 
able to read write this warning is
saying<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.870> boot<00:02:43.049> animation<00:02:43.560> already<00:02:43.830> exists

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
saying the boot animation already exists

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.860 
saying the boot animation already exists
so<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.580> wrote<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.970 

after<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:54.150> reboot<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:59.200> boot<00:02:59.349> animation

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
after that reboot and the boot animation

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.670 
after that reboot and the boot animation
is<00:03:00.190> okay<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.810> course<00:03:02.049> it's<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.349> little<00:03:02.379> bit

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
is okay of course it's a little bit

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.610 
is okay of course it's a little bit
squashed<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.470> Android<00:03:07.049> looks<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.319> bit

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
squashed so the the Android looks a bit

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:24.979 
squashed so the the Android looks a bit
better<00:03:12.120> rebooting<00:03:13.120> now

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.319 

and<00:03:25.989> there<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.859> have<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.989> fits<00:03:30.329> nice

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
and there we have it it fits nice

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:40.830
