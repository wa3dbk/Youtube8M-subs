little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.620> far<00:00:40.829> away<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.570> an

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
little bit far away now this is an

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
little bit far away now this is an
aluminum<00:00:42.989> stand<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> polycarbonate

because<00:00:46.500> usually<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:47.190> stands<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.670> all

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
because usually these stands are all

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
because usually these stands are all
aluminum<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:49.200> polycarbonate<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.610> as

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
about that it feels like the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
about that it feels like the
polycarbonate<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.189> cheap

polycarbonate is just a little bit cheap

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000 
polycarbonate is just a little bit cheap
for<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.180> rather<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.320> whole<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.830> be

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
for me I rather this whole thing be

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.630 
for me I rather this whole thing be
aluminum<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.119> anyway<00:01:13.250> let's<00:01:14.250> kind<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> go

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
aluminum but anyway let's kind of go

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
aluminum but anyway let's kind of go
over<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> has<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.450> cable<00:01:15.990> management

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
over it it has your cable management

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.710 
over it it has your cable management
hole<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.040> most<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.060> stands<00:01:18.390> do

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
hole there as most of these stands do

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
hole there as most of these stands do
and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.380> has<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> four<00:01:20.189> rubber<00:01:20.460> feet<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.000> it's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
zoom back a little bit the problem i

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.289 
zoom back a little bit the problem i
have<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.629> that<00:02:34.049> it's<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:35.190> as<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.120> see

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
have is is that it's not as you can see

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.270 
have is is that it's not as you can see
it's<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:36.660> real<00:02:36.930> stable<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:37.980> great<00:02:38.160> for

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
it's not real stable so it's great for

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160 
it's not real stable so it's great for
viewing<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.599> you're<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.989> using

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
viewing but if you're going to be using

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.740 
viewing but if you're going to be using
this<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.610> making<00:02:41.790> phone<00:02:42.209> calls<00:02:42.540> or

this for you know making phone calls or
whatever<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:43.980> probably<00:02:45.500> not<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
whatever you know probably not going to

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.600 
whatever you know probably not going to
be<00:02:47.160> good<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.420> because<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.920> not

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
be good for you because it's just not

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.130 
be good for you because it's just not
very<00:02:50.849> stable<00:02:51.299> there<00:02:51.690> okay<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:54.019> that's<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
very stable there okay so that's a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.750 
very stable there okay so that's a
little<00:02:55.230> bit<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> downfall<00:02:56.069> for<00:02:56.130> me<00:02:56.340> i'm<00:02:56.579> not

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
little bit of a downfall for me i'm not

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.680 
little bit of a downfall for me i'm not
sure<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.000> they<00:02:57.120> could<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.360> made<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
sure if they could have made this a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.210 
sure if they could have made this a
little<00:02:57.930> bit<00:02:58.110> bigger<00:02:58.379> or<00:02:58.620> whatever<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.040> make

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
little bit bigger or whatever and make

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.979 
little bit bigger or whatever and make
it<00:02:59.340> more<00:02:59.489> stable<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.660> little<00:03:00.870> bit

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
it more stable but it's a little bit

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.500 
it more stable but it's a little bit
top-heavy<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.799> way<00:03:02.040> now<00:03:02.730> when<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.209> put<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
top-heavy this way now when you put it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.100 
top-heavy this way now when you put it
in<00:03:03.599> landscape<00:03:03.959> mode<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:05.489> lot<00:03:06.420> better<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.989> know

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
in landscape mode a lot better you know

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.530 
in landscape mode a lot better you know
it's<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.410> very<00:03:07.920> easily<00:03:08.160> viewable<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.269> view

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
it's a very easily viewable you can view

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.220 
it's a very easily viewable you can view
a<00:03:09.599> movie<00:03:10.290> or<00:03:10.470> whatever<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.700> lot<00:03:12.420> better<00:03:12.750> when

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
a movie or whatever a a lot better when

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890 
a movie or whatever a a lot better when
you<00:03:13.349> put<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.739> landscape<00:03:14.069> mode<00:03:14.400> again<00:03:15.030> has<00:03:15.870> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
you put it in landscape mode again has a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.710 
you put it in landscape mode again has a
couple<00:03:16.290> different<00:03:16.410> angles<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.540> there's<00:03:21.540> some

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
couple different angles so there's some

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.319 
couple different angles so there's some
good<00:03:21.900> things<00:03:22.139> about<00:03:22.319> this<00:03:22.650> stand<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.790> all<00:03:24.030> at

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
for me and i'm really sad to say that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.460 
for me and i'm really sad to say that
because<00:03:28.859> as<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.940> guys<00:03:30.120> know<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.389> love<00:03:30.630> sgp

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
best but this one I just think that

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.509 
best but this one I just think that
there's<00:03:37.349> better<00:03:37.590> alternatives<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.459> there

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
paying thirty dollars for again it's not

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.690 
paying thirty dollars for again it's not

that's kind of a big downer for me it's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.409 
that's kind of a big downer for me it's
nice<00:03:52.919> and<00:03:53.190> light<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.180> not<00:03:54.269> very
