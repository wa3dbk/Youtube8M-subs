 surfaces and fireboxes creating convection 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 Significantly increased the capacity of the heater 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.890
 heating of stones in which it is carried out 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 not just from a hot prefab house 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.220
 collector but also by 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.140
 convection currents 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.030
 partially directed through the stones

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.869
 collector and chimney base 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 There are two options for heating water in
