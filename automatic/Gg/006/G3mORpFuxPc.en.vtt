00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
robotics and she's going to show off her

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.140 
robotics and she's going to show off her
new<00:00:08.750> you<00:00:09.750> BR<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.290> robot<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:11.969> tell<00:00:12.090> us

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
new you BR one robot so can you tell us

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610 
new you BR one robot so can you tell us
a<00:00:12.240> little<00:00:12.300> bit<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.750> Millie<00:00:12.900> yeah<00:00:13.349> so

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
a little bit about it Millie yeah so

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.650 
a little bit about it Millie yeah so
this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> over<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.519> robot<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.179> it's

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
this is the over one robot and it's

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.560 
this is the over one robot and it's
designed<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.500> mobile<00:00:16.859> manipulation<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
designed to do mobile manipulation so it

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.490 
designed to do mobile manipulation so it
can<00:00:18.869> learn<00:00:19.830> online<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.600> detect<00:00:21.990> objects

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
can learn online and can detect objects

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.250 
can learn online and can detect objects
and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:22.949> manipulate<00:00:23.550> them<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.199> allow<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and then manipulate them and allow you

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.839 
and then manipulate them and allow you
to<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.650> lots<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> different<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.760> your

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to do lots of different things with your

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.759 
to do lots of different things with your
robot<00:00:27.000> platform<00:00:27.269> okay<00:00:28.080> we've<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> little

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
robot platform okay we've got a little

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
robot platform okay we've got a little
demo<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.250> show<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.609> us<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.849> yeah

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
demo you can show for us right yeah

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.530 
demo you can show for us right yeah
definitely<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.820> it's<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> pick<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
definitely so it's going to pick up this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.049 
definitely so it's going to pick up this
cube<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> exciting<00:00:35.579> things<00:00:35.760> about

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
cube so one of the exciting things about

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
cube so one of the exciting things about
what<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> robots<00:00:36.870> doing<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
what the robots doing right now is it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
what the robots doing right now is it's
actually<00:00:38.010> detecting<00:00:38.879> online<00:00:39.420> where<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.230> cube

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
actually detecting online where the cube

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.479 
actually detecting online where the cube
is<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> planning<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.620> real<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is and then it's planning in real time a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
is and then it's planning in real time a
path<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.750> path<00:00:45.989> was

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
path and as you can see that path was

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.639 
path and as you can see that path was
kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> funny<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.899> once<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> picks

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
kind of funny and so now once it picks

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
kind of funny and so now once it picks
up<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> cube<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:50.640> thinking<00:00:51.120> about

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
up the cube it's now thinking about

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
up the cube it's now thinking about
where<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> place<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> block<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
where it's going to place the block and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.080 
where it's going to place the block and
plan<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.760> path<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> real<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
plan that path in real time and one of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
plan that path in real time and one of
the<00:01:00.149> unique<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.500> i<00:01:01.680> can

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the unique things about this is i can

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.369 
the unique things about this is i can
now<00:01:02.039> move<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.550> block<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
now move this block to the other side of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.770 
now move this block to the other side of
table<00:01:04.650> stay<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:09.680> here<00:01:11.180> nope<00:01:12.180> still<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
table stay here here nope still not in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.850 
table stay here here nope still not in
the<00:01:12.840> field<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> here's<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> basically<00:01:16.770> as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the field of you here's so basically as

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
the field of you here's so basically as
long<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> robot<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
long as the robot can see it with the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
long as the robot can see it with the
sensors<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.409> its<00:01:19.560> head<00:01:19.740> it'll<00:01:20.220> find<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sensors on its head it'll find it and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:34.430 
sensors on its head it'll find it and
route

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.590 

very<00:01:35.440> cool<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.890> this<00:01:36.100> is<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.640> simple

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
very cool and this is just a simple

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.270 
very cool and this is just a simple
script<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.260> course<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.860> can<00:01:39.010> do<00:01:39.100> more

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
script of course like it can do more

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.800 
script of course like it can do more
than<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.580> but<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:39.910> does<00:01:40.090> just<00:01:40.390> find<00:01:40.570> things

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
than that but it does just find things

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.750 
than that but it does just find things
in<00:01:40.930> real<00:01:41.110> time<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:41.560> yeah<00:01:41.590> definitely<00:01:42.340> can

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
in real time right yeah definitely can

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.700 
in real time right yeah definitely can
do<00:01:43.180> whatever<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.600> programming<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.230> all

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
do whatever your programming to do all

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.440 
do whatever your programming to do all
right<00:01:44.920> well<00:01:45.100> thank<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.370> very<00:01:45.490> much

so<00:01:54.439> if<00:01:54.829> like<00:01:55.369> if<00:01:55.549> you<00:01:55.640> send<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:55.939> their<00:01:56.060> home

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
so if like if you send in their home

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.660 
so if like if you send in their home
where<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.600> behind<00:01:59.899> me<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.399> robot

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
where if you just behind me so the robot

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.830 
where if you just behind me so the robot
knows<00:02:04.700> I'm<00:02:05.090> here<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.310> politely<00:02:07.310> goes<00:02:07.700> around

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
knows I'm here and politely goes around

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.710 
knows I'm here and politely goes around
and<00:02:09.019> looks<00:02:09.399> as<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.879> as<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.300> turning

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and looks as you can see as it's turning

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.010 
and looks as you can see as it's turning
it<00:02:11.870> points<00:02:12.200> inside<00:02:12.440> where<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.739> needs<00:02:12.890> to
