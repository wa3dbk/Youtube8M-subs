RS line and KS is slowly going to be

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
RS line and KS is slowly going to be
stepping<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.290> fill<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.740> gap<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.400> that

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
stepping up to fill that gap in that

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.270 
stepping up to fill that gap in that
that<00:00:12.150> where<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> RS<00:00:13.049> series<00:00:13.410> used<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.950> so

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
that where the RS series used to be so

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
that where the RS series used to be so
here<00:00:14.490> are<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:14.670> new<00:00:14.910> features<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.020> KS

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
here are some new features to the KS

first off you're going to see the whole

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
first off you're going to see the whole
new<00:00:18.270> redesigned<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.320> new

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
new redesigned here you have this new

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260 
new redesigned here you have this new
grille<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.340> more<00:00:20.520> classic<00:00:21.029> more

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
grille it's a more classic more

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.710 
grille it's a more classic more
sophisticated<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.680> adult<00:00:23.189> speaker<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.570> also

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
sophisticated more adult speaker it also

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.200 
sophisticated more adult speaker it also
is<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:25.980> shallow<00:00:26.430> mounting

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
is going to have a more shallow mounting

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
is going to have a more shallow mounting
depth<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> side<00:00:28.710> shot<00:00:28.740> here

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
depth so if you can get a side shot here

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
depth so if you can get a side shot here
you'll<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.550> able<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.410> six

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you'll be able to see that on this six

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.350 
you'll be able to see that on this six
and<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> half<00:00:31.859> inch<00:00:32.130> speaker<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> actual

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and a half inch speaker the the actual

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
and a half inch speaker the the actual
mounting<00:00:33.719> depth<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.950> shallower

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
mounting depth here is a lot shallower

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
mounting depth here is a lot shallower
so<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.050> able<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> fit<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> more

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so it's going to be able to fit in more

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
so it's going to be able to fit in more
vehicles<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:39.270> they've<00:00:39.420> also<00:00:39.570> upgraded<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
vehicles now they've also upgraded the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.069 
vehicles now they've also upgraded the
tweeter<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.270> silk<00:00:42.750> film

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
tweeter here now you have a silk film

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.400 
tweeter here now you have a silk film
tweeter<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> coaxial<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
tweeter and this on the coaxial is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.170 
tweeter and this on the coaxial is
you're<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.829> getting<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.340> 3/4<00:00:48.000> inch

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you're going to be getting a 3/4 inch

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.229 
you're going to be getting a 3/4 inch
tweeter<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> components<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.059> we

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
tweeter and on the components which we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
tweeter and on the components which we
can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.039> you're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
can see down here you're going to have a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.619 
can see down here you're going to have a
one-inch<00:00:54.420> silk<00:00:54.960> dome<00:00:55.170> tweeter<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
one-inch silk dome tweeter this one is

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
one-inch silk dome tweeter this one is
although<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> looks<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.469> coaxial<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
although it looks like a coaxial this is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
although it looks like a coaxial this is
a<00:00:59.270> convertible<00:01:00.270> system<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a convertible system so this is the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.429 
a convertible system so this is the
component<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.940> one-inch<00:01:03.449> tweeter<00:01:04.019> here

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
component with the one-inch tweeter here

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.170 
component with the one-inch tweeter here
and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:05.010> over<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.820> separate

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and then over here you have the separate

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
and then over here you have the separate
with<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:06.990> inch<00:01:07.140> tweeter<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> your

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

look some new features oh and the
crossovers<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
crossovers which we have here in the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
crossovers which we have here in the
middle<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.439> been<00:01:16.680> redesigned

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
middle these have also been redesigned

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
middle these have also been redesigned
and<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> still<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.850> tweeter

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and you still have your tweeter

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
and you still have your tweeter
attenuation<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.610> pull

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
attenuation here and I can actually pull

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080 
attenuation here and I can actually pull
this<00:01:21.000> off<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> go

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this off just so I can get there we go

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
this off just so I can get there we go
so<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.619> circuit<00:01:26.040> board

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so you can see the the circuit board

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.050 
so you can see the the circuit board
there<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.110> protection<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
there with some some good protection and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
there with some some good protection and
circuitry<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> new

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
circuitry in there so it's a new

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
circuitry in there so it's a new
redesigned<00:01:31.799> crossover<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:32.909> still<00:01:33.299> with
