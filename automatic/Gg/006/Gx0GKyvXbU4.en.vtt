00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.469
 tellier expects her to 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello everyone today I you 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 found in a new video a little 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.700
 more special is a little longer than 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 the others I will indeed help you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 realize your local guy case like you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 know I'll spend it in a few 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.289
 time so that will allow me to revise 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
 one last time all I could 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.349
 to learn and to teach you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.640
 so we do not waste time and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.320
 let's start right now 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.000
 this video will be divided into three parts 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.539
 sonia the general knowledge the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.550
 longer 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.769
 the second least care 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.900
 important and the third the theory of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.010
 So the practice is gone for the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.620
 general knowledge 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.180
 first we have the power there 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 must know that the horse's stomach has 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.750
 between 15 to 20 h which is very 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 small compared to the morphology of the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 horse as the bwa chouval from 20 to 40 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.210
 liters of water by playing his last must 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.520
 be at your disposal all day 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.090
 there are three families of milk foods 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 wheat barley oat concentrate 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.019
 corn and all that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.460
 the proposed forage of hay from 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.649
 natural grasslands or country stoves 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 artificial as well as straw 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.160
 not that straw is not a vital 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 the nutritional needs of the horse 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.479
 just to better digest food the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.159
 point should not be moldy nor 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.659
 dusty and that we finish we have 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
 dietary supplements that are 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 manufactured industrially but with 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 Germans of natural origin 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.300
 respect the intestinal transit of the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.030
 horse ie flow 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.460
 the iman in the digestive tract because in case 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 of soma overloaded there may be some 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.700
 packages that can be deadly 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.980
 the horse's feeding must be 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.350
 chosen according to his weight his age and his 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.630
 activity then let's go to the dead 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.130
 the usual vernacular death 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.250
 recognizes through rings are in 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.760
 as thou hast Lemort needle dead 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.160
 simple lemort chantilly the dead pelham 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.690
 as well as the dead beautiful silk and in 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.250
 last we have the dead lifters who 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.170
 in my opinion may not be a dead person 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.890
 a young person but it's always good 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.560
 to know it 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.400
 let's talk about closed protections 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 or open 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.180
 you must be galloping 4 capable of 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.950
 put protections you have to know 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.440
 that the four farms and protects the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.690
 guns as well as the tendons while 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.580
 the four open only protects the state 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.290
 the ball protects it protects well 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.710
 obviously the dumplings to make my 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.540
 Manga 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.270
 always start with the thong 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.770
 lower and not too tight to 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.440
 not cut blood circulation 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.360
 the bells she protects the crown 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.620
 as well as the stallion you should be 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 also able to recognize 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.100
 spam behavior or not that complicated 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.380
 because if the horse is prostrate in 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.640
 his death box his input stirred a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.069
 unusual behavior 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.750
 he is of young age that is equal 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.180
 a problem or illness 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 so after his monitor to consult 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 a doctor let's move on to the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.550
 second category who are the care 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 it's the least important but you have to 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.510
 carry on knowing because remember that the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.520
 gallop 4 is equal to a patent of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.140
 riders it's a big but you 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.209
 allows more and more to be autonomous 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.010
 with your horse and therefore to own 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.080
 one so know how to make a move to this 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.910
 level there it's elementary pro to a 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.020
 vision we always start talking and 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.440
 laughs followed by the bush cap and 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.880
 curepipe 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.650
 it's the basic passage but we 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.959
 can add elemental brushes 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.790
 as the brush accra that not only 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.220
 will unravel the screen better will also 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.720
 maintain all the fears as well as the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.700
 horse's tail because having straw 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 in the tail of the horse it is very dirty 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.300
 and that we must take care of everything 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.769
 the body of the game we also have them 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.390
 loved ones happens in the corners of 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 eyes in the nostrils as well as the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.690
 commissure of lips that get wet 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.700
 with clear water 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.860
 then to finish all this - also 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.140
 use strollers or verberie is 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.489
 the box as well as the hoof fat 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.980
 as well as the brush 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.750
 heat stroke him and get out the hair 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 after the shower and finally we have 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.370
 the theory of practice which is a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480
 step that we normally have enough 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.130
 know well since we have it 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.290
 work is going on all through 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.420
 our year so you have to know this 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.610
 that impulse what is the contact this 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.500
 she the tightrope jump start scan 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.820
 galloping movement of a hip 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.709
 queen of opening for a queen 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.570
 opposite so to help you 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.400
 the impulse is the natural energy or 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.680
 acquired by the work that generates the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.269
 horse movement contact him 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.100
 all of the information taking that 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.350
 lecavalier is a poor pokhran mount 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.090
 communication the beat he was tuning z 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.340
 the action of the different helpers asking 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 same order to its mount you must know 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 that to request a galloping start the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.879
 lower treading the assembly in 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.380
 outside to back the time towards the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.870
 opening interior as well as the queen 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.160
 exr tense to move the hips there 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.510
 need a remote position leg 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.100
 slightly behind town of 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.870
 verviers that act perpendicularly 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.310
 horse as the opening queen format 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.169
 to flex a necklace or learning 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.910
 young horses helps to inform the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.530
 fumel more easily from the direction 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.550
 that we understand that the opposite queen 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.960
 against the shoulders 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.479
 you must know the posture of the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.580
 rider whether in dressage or at 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.370
 the obstacle know what she incurvation 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.110
 elodie so do not forget that a curation 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.690
 she makes the horse ploie 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.419
 entirely from head to tail in 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.950
 the deer line or in the corners and 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.330
 bly laugh about 4 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.180
 cornering with accumulation 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.280
 inside and that the fold is a flexion 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.530
 from the neckline at his base he 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.450
 must know the mechanism of the cap 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.300
 is very simple for that here is a 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.780
 schema does bison so here's a horse 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.880
 video schematize by my grand take 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.800
 the example of galloping on the left it will be the 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.360
 right rear which will start then 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.250
 the right diagonal biped and finally 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.110
 the left anterior as well as the phase of 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.610
 projection and shower for galloping at 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.590
 right to finish it also needs 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.289
 know the phases of the sou and that's it 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.060
 for cap theory 4 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.320
 to finish I do not know if the champion 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.970
 that I'm going to quote will appear in 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.620
 your gallop theory 4 but that's 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.080
 better to know them you need to know 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.810
 how to adjust a good net that's 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 gallop 1 but a little more in the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.240
 details this thing 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.990
 you also need to know about vaccines 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.030
 obligatory cabbages and finally the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.560
 photo ID of the horse I 'm not 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.290
 not sure that it will be all the better 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.640
 better fate and so here with all 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.100
 these elements there normally your 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.840
 brain and then have the best rating of 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.610
 your world do not forget to help you 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.570
 other books than to live from 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.250
 lawyer 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.380
 for example there is the road and 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.030
 riding which is actually a very good 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.220
 book to learn the theory of 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.870
 practical and that's great so I have not 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.850
 of you I have to evaluate with thighs 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.950
 of mouko g to see what you need 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.700
 still revised under promises that you 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.410
 help enormously 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.660
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.110
 will have pleased us will not have seemed boring in 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.940
 spoken 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.640
 if you want others like this 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.190
 do not hesitate I'll do it and that's it 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.240
 good day to you more is a very 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.240
 good passage of the law you 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.460
 Oh 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.289
 Oh 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.910
 at
