00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
complicated lock washer and how it works

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.740 
complicated lock washer and how it works
is<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> thin<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.799> strip<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> metal

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
is it's a thin little strip of metal

that one end is bent over the spacer
block<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> other<00:01:29.759> end<00:01:30.200> when

block here and then the other end when

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
block here and then the other end when
you<00:01:31.439> tighten<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.189> nut<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> Bell

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you tighten down the nut on the Bell

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
you tighten down the nut on the Bell
assembly<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.570> bend<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> tab<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.380> against<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
assembly you bend the tab up against the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
assembly you bend the tab up against the
nut<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.939> locks<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> nut<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> place<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
nut and it locks the nut in place and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
nut and it locks the nut in place and
keeps<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.380> backing<00:01:37.710> off<00:01:38.009> due<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
keeps it from backing off due to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
keeps it from backing off due to
vibration<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> Bell<00:01:39.890> now<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> fact

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
vibration from the Bell now the fact

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.179 
vibration from the Bell now the fact
that<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.729> piece<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.649> Bell<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that that piece is on this Bell and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.109 
that that piece is on this Bell and
intact

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
intact

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
intact
means<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.049> Bell<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> completely

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
means that this Bell is completely

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
means that this Bell is completely
factory<00:01:48.030> original<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> left<00:01:49.680> EMD<00:01:51.079> now<00:01:52.079> the

only other question about this Bell is
is<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.740> steel<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.640> bronze<00:01:56.850> well<00:01:57.659> there's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is it steel or is it bronze well there's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
is it steel or is it bronze well there's
two<00:01:58.200> ways<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.740> check<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> find<00:01:59.310> this
