 a blue but sure of its strength 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500
 it's a complete sport that has been kind of attention 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.739
 at the physical level whether it is upper limbs of arms as 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.490
 legs 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.440
 it's one of self-transcendence 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.480
 and to push you the Asemites its own limits so% 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.730
 indeed why we gave faster then% 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.680

 alain kieffer to ensure follow-up and in particular the increase in 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.950
 performance the preparation before going a little bit 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.440
 it's a little in relation 2% to the individualities at this parade it's 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.090
 not necessarily necessary this indispensable how what me 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.580
 concerning I have never had any mental preparation 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.850
 because i have the luck in europe 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 I sang it changed a lot with my coach me on 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 here is my life every day not only on the sports 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 but rather in my personal life with helium 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.180
 simply so that they know where I am and then there if it can have 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.770
 repercussions on training without competition 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 indeed traded in shares 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 every top athlete must have a dozen goals 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.560
 special 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 it is then perceived sponsors of simple things in spite of all that remains 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.490
 balanced diet % 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 I do I'm not really riding the program this intention is to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.960
 to have a good time 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.890
 gold because the pleasure to pleasure outside swimming remains important site 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 remains important so that we can not complain 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.550
 the trainings are 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.030
 it consists of different stages of Madeira with radon two 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.170
 daily workouts in deraa two clocks in the morning two o'clock 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.349
 in the cold 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.799
 once every two days for an hour of physical preparation delay 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.519
 was so scared with the muscular strengthening of the abdoulaye worker 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.739
 wade win at the end of the year 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 to apply the fundamental principles torture 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:29.079
 the competition at the national 1 against the armada that was part of the game 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.099
 Marseille 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.199
 in any sport get there to prove to us if it is 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.279
 I'm not going to say that it worries me more than that to me I'm trying to do 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.969
 my way to do the best I can 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.769
 after and if I have to be less strong competition I will be less strong loved 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.509
 his propensity of the game so I'm pretty good at the media like 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.509
 bring a little competition because it sells because 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.859
 we sell adversity and we sell the show finally so gold 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.619
 Nancy is sad to say but they already saw us in the final of 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.099
 world championships with illovo love who was not yet qualified 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.509
 73rd 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.499
 and unfortunately for him failed to qualify 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.419
 which means that 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.900
 but here we have to talk football 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.289
 approving things before they're gone 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.609
 I do not like to go too far either because it is formed on the ambitions of 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:14.589
 responsible for 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.239
 always of my ambition is to be world champion of the 100 meters swim 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.799
 free because 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.239
 because here I am currently managed people finally arrive to do 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.129
 world-class times 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.849
 you will start 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 that's all it's perfectly logical for me to mylÃ¨ne world title 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.169
 but it's in my head to stay myself 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.559
 b demos always questioning at the end of life everything 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.169
 question the concrete work 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.659
 to predict to evolve to prove so this is percent 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.159
 I am told that I am certain that I will not change in the time of 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.229
 being 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 I am passionate h passionate passionate guitarist aeronautics 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.310
 and percent eyes 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.050
 that's just the father still a lot of things have to be done a lot 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.679
 of things on Thursday the title 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.679
 the days are quickly filled with departure 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.069
 in europe the memories this stage 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.299
 respect and humility the gold requirement because 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.779
 laureys quoted because I practice a sport of high level it is necessary 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.650
 respect his opponents 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.520
 negligence now it takes a lot of the requirements 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.289
 and percent he is able to hit the effective mans let's say 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.469
 and a lot of humility to the point of everything and all that in order to be able to get 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.039
 questioning racket at any level whatsoever 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.789
 we're going to say it's not because we're Olympic champion world record that he 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.330
 must flock they will be opposed what we can do 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.889
 so percent were very important to dance
