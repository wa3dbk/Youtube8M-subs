00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
 I thought I know that so many 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.150
 now I wish that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.560
 back in the camera I do that now 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.210
 I just always became so thousand 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700
 I do not get it right now 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 times in january is a very big 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 give a project and then comes too 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 at the same time my book out so it 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
 is now the next two months am 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.750
 i only cut and write on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.160
 filmmaking does not know everything filmed 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
 but there is more information about it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.220
 because I'll be one more 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.349
 cut small trailer that you stop 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 just sees what it will and will be 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.239
 stop just in time to prepare 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 so that you know then and in time 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.989
 know that there a valid action that is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 cool or 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 good morning it is now I know it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.350
 not and we are now on the way to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.329
 beach but not just to the beach 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 because the world is 50 meters away 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.620
 but to a ball beach right 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
 cool 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 It is about two kilometers away 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 theoretically one could here for 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.260
 three euros also a taxi 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 take that too little knowledge 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100
 By the way, only two 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 that's the whole team 2 and hamburg too 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.330
 to run 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 there the taxis will be us 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.100
 one hundred percent kite questions the 2 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 I think breakfast is even here 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.600
 for immeasurably there or still 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.100
 what is kicking me now is getting slow 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 We have to do that a bit today 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.970
 keep up a little 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.970
 That's half the way 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.619
 the sun has almost risen 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.390
 always so fast there it is a bit 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 so that the sky will be like that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.820
 cleaned a bit and then the burns 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.710
 Sun 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.710
 that's why they have to unite 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.500
 we are here and the sun is not yet 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.500
 completely absorbed 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.250
 we are finished now and do it now 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.520
 We had sport 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.020
 this little one 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.020
 on the 17th 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.820
 quite a lot considering the blow 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.410
 want and can 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.980
 We are going slowly , too, the poor 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 stitched 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.150
 60 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.920
 Day target achieved we have that earlier 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.650
 made believe there were other two 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 Good, I hope our 210 times 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.420
 second shooting 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.129
 the first time has somehow here too 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.530
 that's exactly where film in the outfit does not suit us 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.940
 built entirely out the second time eight 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.690
 should we have overslept 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.220
 not really but now we go something 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.590
 We bring the things first again 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.590
 back to the hotel and then eat 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.000
 Now look what that is 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.000
 hotel lobby 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.770
 This is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.510
 then a little bit of the super 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.849
 blue hat can be seen 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.620
 yes it is super nice me in any case 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.890
 do not even know if I'm 100 ok too 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.300
 there is always something there 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.220
 actually I wanted to have a picture of that 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.350
 have a bridge and then this is here 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.480
 so happened randomly and it falls 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.280
 me the waters and that is that 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.410
 is easy and it fits right 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.600
 good to the type and looks as well 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.250
 small stems good which means if 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.390
 we liked that now then tell me 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.080
 let me know, because then I'll do it 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.610
 even more 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.829
 I'm in the mood for it, I hope so 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.750
 many other people in the next 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.100
 days I will write a lot 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.329
 will be a few more samples 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.280
 maybe even make it 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.660
 I'll get something out of it beforehand 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.110
 something to do with my hair 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.690
 what will I tell nature 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.770
 anticipate already for me now 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.650
 1 we have at the last 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.150
 Sample shots ever found out 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.680
 when the hairs just grow out 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.180
 then that does not look so good in the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.800
 bock have all this experience with then 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.800
 So let me know soon
