00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
linear story so we won't have as large

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.920 
linear story so we won't have as large
urban<00:00:27.060> environments<00:00:27.449> where<00:00:27.539> cottage<00:00:27.840> is

through<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> course<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> level<00:00:49.340> we've

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
through the course of that level we've

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.270 
through the course of that level we've
also<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> gone<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> idea<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
also kind of gone with the the idea that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.029 
also kind of gone with the the idea that
that<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> cops<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.649> sort<00:00:55.920> of

that a lot of cops you know sort of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.330 
that a lot of cops you know sort of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
buzzing around you constantly you know

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
buzzing around you constantly you know
shifting<00:01:00.090> around<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.449> front<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> like

shifting around in front of you like

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
shifting around in front of you like
we've<00:01:01.020> seen<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> carbon<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.770> run<00:01:02.010> around

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we've seen in carbon or run around

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
we've seen in carbon or run around
before<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> quite<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.199> want

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
before that it's not quite the way want

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
before that it's not quite the way want
to<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.650> find<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to go we find that it's like one

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.000 
to go we find that it's like one
intelligent<00:01:06.540> cop<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> lot<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.560> powerful

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
intelligent cop is a lot more powerful

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
intelligent cop is a lot more powerful
than<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.150> hundreds<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> cops<00:01:09.930> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
than than like hundreds of cops just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
than than like hundreds of cops just
coming<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.680> everywhere<00:01:10.860> ramming<00:01:11.549> into

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
walls or whatever they do normally so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
walls or whatever they do normally so
we've<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.729> focused<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.509> making<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we've really focused on on making it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.210 
we've really focused on on making it
about<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.740> sort<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> intimate

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
about the the sort of intimate

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
about the the sort of intimate
experience<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.000> between<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
past NEPA speeds elbram you do simple

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
past NEPA speeds elbram you do simple
stuff<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> new
