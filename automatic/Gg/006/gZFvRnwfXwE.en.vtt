00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.179
 Today I'm going to teach the shirt and 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.660
 I'll start with the template but the link is 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.000
 this shirt trapped on the low Sabbath and the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.000
 first step is to cut shirt bar 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.469
 now this model will be in T - shirt 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.899
 regatta then is to vote the sleeves 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.730
 the finished race I will count down here 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.629
 only that the retreat is essential is that 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.629
 stay at least four of them here 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.629
 Angola 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.880
 now I'll do 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.880
 the collar model 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.580
 I 'm going to take this seam first. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.810
 and now I'll do the front part z 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.810
 caught in the middle 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.380
 now I teach to make a model of 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.910
 customization but the shirt 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.800
 remains male model 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.880
 but the customization will be the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 Woman wearing I'm gonna cut off the shoulder 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.460
 leaked and the back of the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:06.610
 different organization first cut the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.610
 shirt collar and sleeve ends check 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.470
 the part of the shoulder that will be the part 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 heavy on arak folding shirt here at 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.940
 band with low and yes 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.319
 I'm going to make a triangle. 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.880
 I'm going back to get kinda 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.880
 round 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.170
 the case 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.830
 what is the part that seems to us in the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.830
 another is the same on the other side 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:25.090
 now I will be cut but I will win 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.090
 throw the shirt in the middle 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.250
 and I'm going to see your triangular face from here and 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.170
 is entering the base will end here 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.000
 greater part of the triangle will be here in the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.260
 from the top of the track the tip will be low 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.630
 so they'll like more or less what 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.610
 how will you stay if you want to score a 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.180
 draw triangle from inside the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.180
 shirt too 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.950
 Now I'm going to teach seeding 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.740
 hold the first first you that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.720
 will pull all of them and will give a 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.720
 pulled to stay more solve 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.380
 the transaction was the first will pass 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.530
 catch the second you pass on 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.120
 the first and handle this and will thus be the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.650
 process to the end 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.920
 This is ahead of us and so 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.920
 successively 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.890
 when it comes to the bag like we do not 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.750
 I will not use the needle line, I will. 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.750
 learn this tip with a little box 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.640
 silver crosstape 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.099
 and you can also learn the first one 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.840
 You used to learn here not to stay. 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.840
