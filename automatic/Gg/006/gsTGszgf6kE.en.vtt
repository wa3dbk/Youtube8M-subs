00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 what do you do to season chair nonsense 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.020
 yes I have a letter recently that goes 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.889
 an option extended this stuff is still the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.080
 breathe like that pastry or not against me me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 have taken into use 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 week you are just fine another year 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 extra and quite we will see what is what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.279
 going to happen 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.270
 so no secret that you are one step higher 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 want to make anyway 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.580
 no, now that the other rates are correct 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.029
 well and this season is going a bit better 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.180
 last year so I really need something 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.860
 a kind once the but not not such 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 good condition is not in itself so me 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 you don't know what 37 says you mean that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 not good for now we have something 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.590
 he even catherine's eggs 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.170
 maybe that is also an option for them 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 perhaps also in itself than of both 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 sides better say that would say 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 what would you like deep in your heart 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.770
 tom i was 24 now and i would be really nice 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 make stable abroad or one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.609
 nobler motive serious but not the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.620
 disadvantages of hair had what i spray 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.409
 real i shed well i'm good here and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.119
 I play with full pleasure you know 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.280
 agent also many people 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 yes you know the window and you expect it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 what comes around next summer yes that lies 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 my knees and him and a light think of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.939
 myself if you just play well and lesson 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 take advantage of the goals well 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.630
 team kept praying then you have to wait 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 what will happen 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.310
 explain to me what a step forward is 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310
 for you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.009
 because we skip behind with parents 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.049
 9 is so that is difficult in itself though 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 never better it in the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.610
 then i will not go under other player 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 aso say what i would say i sit he 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.689
 good at is not really necessary late 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.159
 sourcer so if you at az 8 tons per year 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.880
 could earn you can through draw and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.930
 you stay here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.329
 no then no there now but I don't know if 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.710
 someone who deserves bosses but no we 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 to turn on 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.270
 do you know what it is turn the in this 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.740
 Season is very good when it's on 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 be themselves 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 are conditions that make you something better you me 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.479
 think that such a schimmert concept is a step 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.399
 forward 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 you have to say that what is one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.250
 step ahead 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.780
 ya know on weekly for say that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.310
 is a step forward 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.590
 financially that is also a step by one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.930
 number then az is now 14 yes but me 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.069
 got all that going to put so 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.780
 and but to give an example it is 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.700
 so awkward because one step ahead is the top 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.959
 5 is but there falls for example now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 move outside 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.030
 no exactly that anyway but then you look 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.519
 actually on a yes how they played 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.640
 but if you just have one ended 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.190
 years looked into the future then you know 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.560
 what that they do indeed take care of me 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.870
 you get outgrown that again 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.870
 which is not the one that you can get at the same 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.160
 trainer or fellow players but I feel it 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.450
 just me good and i play i play 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.360
 always a winning 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.290
 full confidence and those guys too 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.730
 that is just right 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.730
 wherein a 40
