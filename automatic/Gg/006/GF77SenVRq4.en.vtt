big screen lastly the speed of a sensor
is<00:03:06.170> another<00:03:06.530> important<00:03:06.980> factor<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.310> your

is another important factor for your

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.550 
is another important factor for your
camera<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.450> because<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.990> faster<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
camera this is because the faster the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.500 
camera this is because the faster the
sensor<00:03:09.860> images<00:03:10.190> are<00:03:10.310> processed<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.270> higher

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
advantage here is that with a higher
