what you do with all these kind of
game-changing<00:00:49.320> technologies<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.699> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
game-changing technologies I think that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
game-changing technologies I think that
makes<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.079> relevant<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:53.090> collaborate<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
makes it so relevant to collaborate and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
makes it so relevant to collaborate and
on<00:00:54.570> top<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> makes<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.710> much<00:00:55.739> fun

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
on top of that it makes it so much fun

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.360 
on top of that it makes it so much fun
because<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:57.510> learn<00:00:57.719> every<00:00:58.050> day<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.370> the

because we learn every day from the

because we learn every day from the

the application centers that we have

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
the application centers that we have
they<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.580> who<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.390> about

they see people who know a lot about

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
they see people who know a lot about
light<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> light<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> we

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
light but about the light that we

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.570 
light but about the light that we
already<00:01:11.549> make<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.460> products<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
already make not about the products of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.929 
already make not about the products of
the<00:01:14.700> future<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.810> co-create

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
the future that we can co-create

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.980 
the future that we can co-create
together<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.210> those<00:01:18.390> designers<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
together with those designers and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
together with those designers and
architects

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560 

it's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.259> very<00:01:23.670> personal<00:01:24.670> question<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.299> course

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
it's a very personal question of course

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.599 
it's a very personal question of course
to<00:01:25.719> talk<00:01:25.899> about<00:01:26.020> inspiration<00:01:26.590> because<00:01:27.219> we<00:01:27.399> all

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
to talk about inspiration because we all

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.819 
to talk about inspiration because we all
experience<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.329> differently<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.590> think

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
experience that differently and I think

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.919 
experience that differently and I think
roughly<00:01:30.399> speaking<00:01:30.759> there<00:01:31.149> are<00:01:31.240> designers<00:01:31.600> who

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
roughly speaking there are designers who

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.630 
roughly speaking there are designers who
are<00:01:32.049> inspired<00:01:32.530> by<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.829> world<00:01:33.069> around<00:01:33.369> them

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
are inspired by the world around them

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.090 
are inspired by the world around them
and<00:01:33.909> there<00:01:34.569> are<00:01:34.600> designers<00:01:35.200> who<00:01:35.319> are<00:01:35.350> much

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
and there are designers who are much

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.359 
and there are designers who are much
inspired<00:01:36.549> by<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.479> world<00:01:37.990> inside<00:01:38.500> them

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
inspired by the world inside them

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.910 
inspired by the world inside them
but<00:01:40.060> I'm<00:01:40.179> inspired<00:01:40.719> by<00:01:40.840> what<00:01:41.170> people<00:01:41.319> do<00:01:41.619> in

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
but I'm inspired by what people do in

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.889 
but I'm inspired by what people do in
the<00:01:42.039> light<00:01:42.219> that<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.520> make<00:01:42.729> how<00:01:43.240> they<00:01:43.420> work<00:01:43.659> how

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
the light that I make how they work how

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.080 
the light that I make how they work how
they<00:01:44.109> live<00:01:44.319> how<00:01:44.649> they<00:01:45.039> relax<00:01:45.549> how<00:01:45.819> they<00:01:45.969> get

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
they live how they relax how they get

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.050 
they live how they relax how they get
excited<00:01:46.659> how<00:01:47.109> it<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.619> captivate<00:01:48.399> them<00:01:48.789> in<00:01:48.969> a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
excited how it can captivate them in a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.289 
excited how it can captivate them in a
story<00:01:49.569> in<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.380> theater<00:01:50.890> how<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:51.880> tell

has<00:02:22.120> always<00:02:22.450> been<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.290> important<00:02:23.799> in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
has always been so important in

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.259 
has always been so important in
architecture<00:02:24.519> if<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.850> would<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.150> an

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
architecture if you would be an

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.180 
architecture if you would be an
architecture<00:02:25.840> student<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.530> would<00:02:26.650> mostly

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
architecture student you would mostly

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.370 
architecture student you would mostly
study<00:02:27.549> light<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.060> would<00:02:28.209> study<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:29.170> light

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
study light you would study how light

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.650 
study light you would study how light
shapes<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.010> spaces<00:02:30.670> how<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.000> shadows<00:02:31.630> change

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
shapes the spaces how the shadows change

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.530 
shapes the spaces how the shadows change
over<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> course<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:33.010> day<00:02:33.160> how<00:02:33.790> people

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
over the course of the day how people

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.390 
over the course of the day how people
would<00:02:34.660> move<00:02:34.900> through<00:02:35.260> spaces<00:02:35.980> being

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
would move through spaces being

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430 
would move through spaces being
attracted<00:02:37.000> by<00:02:37.030> light<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.840> was<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.079> main

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
attracted by light it was a main

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.370 
attracted by light it was a main
component<00:02:39.099> of<00:02:39.160> architecture<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.389> then<00:02:41.109> came

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
component of architecture and then came

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.289 
component of architecture and then came
electric<00:02:41.829> lighting<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.910> kind<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
electric lighting and it kind of

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.629 
electric lighting and it kind of
functionalized<00:02:44.230> everything<00:02:44.739> suddenly<00:02:45.250> we

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
functionalized everything suddenly we

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.640 
functionalized everything suddenly we
made<00:02:45.819> light<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:46.900> functionality

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
made light just for functionality

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.650 
made light just for functionality
because<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.549> could<00:02:48.700> turn<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.510> could

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
because we could turn it on and we could

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.599 
because we could turn it on and we could
turn<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.840> off<00:02:50.109> now<00:02:50.859> with<00:02:50.919> the<00:02:51.280> latest

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
turn it off now with the latest

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.629 
turn it off now with the latest
technologies<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.419> LEDs<00:02:52.989> enable<00:02:53.620> us<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:54.069> embed

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
technologies the LEDs enable us to embed

it<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.350> stories<00:03:21.890> come<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.430> connections

you<00:03:23.090> make<00:03:23.300> friends<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.080> make<00:03:24.350> music<00:03:24.590> and

you make friends and you make music and

you make friends and you make music and
you<00:03:25.010> eat<00:03:25.220> something<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.300> besides<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.380> or

maybe<00:03:28.280> more<00:03:28.820> over<00:03:29.270> light<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.140> something<00:03:30.620> so

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
maybe more over light is something so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.790 
maybe more over light is something so
