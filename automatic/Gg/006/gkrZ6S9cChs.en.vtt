00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
bottom and the middle rail now I didn't

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.340 
bottom and the middle rail now I didn't
include<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.090> footage<00:00:41.630> for<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.960> bead<00:00:42.140> lock

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
include the footage for the bead lock

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.459 
include the footage for the bead lock
setup<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.040> all<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.880> for<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.109> headboard

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
setup and all that for for the headboard

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.080 
setup and all that for for the headboard
because<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:45.920> pretty<00:00:46.100> much<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.489> exact<00:00:46.820> same

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
because it's pretty much the exact same

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.729 
because it's pretty much the exact same
as<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:49.090> footboard<00:00:50.179> so<00:00:50.870> if<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.469> want<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.679> know

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
as the footboard so if you want to know

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.889 
as the footboard so if you want to know
how<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.920> do<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.160> bead<00:00:52.340> lock<00:00:52.519> for<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.420> go

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
how to do the bead lock for that then go

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.079 
how to do the bead lock for that then go
to<00:00:54.379> my<00:00:54.679> footboard<00:00:55.160> video<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.390> watch<00:00:56.539> that<00:00:57.070> so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
to my footboard video and watch that so

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.599 
to my footboard video and watch that so
let's<00:00:59.089> get<00:00:59.210> started<00:00:59.949> ok<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.010> here<00:01:01.309> I've<00:01:01.429> got<00:01:01.579> my

router<00:01:02.120> set<00:01:02.570> with<00:01:02.750> its<00:01:02.929> fence<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:04.550> cut<00:01:04.760> each

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
router set with its fence to cut each

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.930 
router set with its fence to cut each
side<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.960> wall<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:07.340> I'll<00:01:07.430> cut<00:01:07.610> each<00:01:07.730> side

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
side of the wall so I'll cut each side

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
side of the wall so I'll cut each side
of<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.120> walls<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.600> then<00:01:08.750> go<00:01:08.900> back<00:01:09.170> through

start by defining my walls using the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
start by defining my walls using the
dado<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.080> had<00:02:55.170> already<00:02:55.350> cut<00:02:55.710> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.100> top

once<00:03:20.670> my<00:03:20.850> walls<00:03:21.120> were<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.450> find<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:22.020> moved<00:03:22.710> on<00:03:22.860> to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
once my walls were to find I moved on to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:37.880 
once my walls were to find I moved on to
the<00:03:23.160> ends<00:03:23.490> of<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:24.510> mortise<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.320> bottom

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
that will be for the plywood panels that

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.440 
that will be for the plywood panels that
will<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.210> put<00:04:40.990> into<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.730> headboard<00:04:42.730> which<00:04:43.300> you

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
will be put into the headboard which you

will be put into the headboard which you
can<00:04:43.570> see<00:04:43.750> right<00:04:43.930> here<00:04:43.990> there's<00:04:44.620> another<00:04:44.740> data

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
can see right here there's another data

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.740 
can see right here there's another data
where<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.550> plywood<00:04:46.150> panels<00:04:46.900> will<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.200> into<00:04:48.750> so

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
where the plywood panels will go into so

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.740 
where the plywood panels will go into so
and<00:04:50.200> then<00:04:51.160> from<00:04:51.400> there<00:04:51.580> at<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.060> very<00:04:52.210> top<00:04:52.510> is

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
and then from there at the very top is

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.790 
and then from there at the very top is
the<00:04:53.169> top<00:04:53.200> rail<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:55.090> has<00:04:55.300> got<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.690> nice<00:04:56.200> mortise

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
the top rail this has got a nice mortise

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.490 
the top rail this has got a nice mortise
in<00:04:56.950> it<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.930> can<00:04:59.080> kind<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.320> see<00:04:59.530> there<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:01.660> one

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
in it you can kind of see there it's one

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.520 
in it you can kind of see there it's one
one<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.220> half<00:05:03.340> inches<00:05:03.730> from<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.240> top<00:05:04.540> deep

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
one and a half inches from the top deep

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.190 
one and a half inches from the top deep
so<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.640> top<00:05:07.030> rail<00:05:07.300> will<00:05:07.450> sit<00:05:07.660> in<00:05:07.780> there<00:05:07.990> and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
so the top rail will sit in there and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.040 
so the top rail will sit in there and
the<00:05:09.040> top<00:05:09.220> rail<00:05:09.400> has<00:05:09.580> another<00:05:09.850> date<00:05:10.090> oh<00:05:10.150> just

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
the top rail has another date oh just

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.650 
the top rail has another date oh just
like<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.230> sides<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.919> bottom<00:05:12.630> for<00:05:13.630> the

be it for the joinery except for making
the<00:05:23.800> tenon<00:05:24.100> for<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.340> top<00:05:24.550> rail<00:05:24.820> that's<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
the tenon for the top rail that's the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.790 
the tenon for the top rail that's the
only<00:05:25.570> thing<00:05:25.660> I<00:05:25.720> got<00:05:25.750> left<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.110> do<00:05:26.230> for<00:05:26.260> joinery

only thing I got left to do for joinery

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.600 
only thing I got left to do for joinery
for<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.820> headboard<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.500> that's<00:05:30.370> what<00:05:30.550> it
