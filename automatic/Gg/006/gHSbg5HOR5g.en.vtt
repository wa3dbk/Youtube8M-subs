00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.380 
block this support beam here now as
you're<00:00:47.620> grappling<00:00:47.860> up<00:00:48.250> hit<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.850> wall<00:00:49.210> as

you're falling down so like once you

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.950 
you're falling down so like once you
press<00:00:51.519> your<00:00:51.670> grab<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.850> button<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.600> know<00:00:52.690> just

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
press your grab a button you know just

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.590 
press your grab a button you know just
before<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:53.860> get<00:00:54.070> there<00:00:54.339> hit<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:54.940> wall<00:00:55.269> you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
before you get there hit the wall you

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.850 
before you get there hit the wall you
know<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.809> really<00:00:55.930> doesn't<00:00:56.320> matter<00:00:56.470> about<00:00:56.739> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
know it really doesn't matter about the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.470 
know it really doesn't matter about the
timing<00:00:57.220> as<00:00:57.489> long<00:00:57.670> as<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:57.909> can<00:00:58.059> hit<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.300> wall

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
timing as long as you can hit the wall

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630 
timing as long as you can hit the wall
you<00:00:58.659> should<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.960> fine<00:00:59.230> but<00:00:59.890> I<00:00:59.920> recommend<00:01:00.519> you

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
you should be fine but I recommend you

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.670 
you should be fine but I recommend you
put<00:01:00.820> your<00:01:01.000> crosshair<00:01:01.510> where<00:01:01.930> my<00:01:02.110> crosshair<00:01:02.650> is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
put your crosshair where my crosshair is

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.439 
put your crosshair where my crosshair is
because<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.250> honestly<00:01:03.699> I've<00:01:04.119> had<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.420> most

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
because I honestly I've had the most

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.420 
because I honestly I've had the most
luckier<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.290> I've<00:01:05.649> you<00:01:05.830> know<00:01:05.860> I've<00:01:05.950> tried<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
luckier and I've you know I've tried the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.920 
luckier and I've you know I've tried the
middle<00:01:06.700> I've<00:01:06.850> tried<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.330> right<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.840> it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
middle I've tried the right and it

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.510 
middle I've tried the right and it
doesn't<00:01:08.110> work<00:01:08.409> that<00:01:08.590> well<00:01:08.770> if<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:09.490> some

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
doesn't work that well if for some

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.490 
doesn't work that well if for some
reason<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:10.000> works<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.300> best<00:01:10.420> here<00:01:10.750> anyways

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
reason it works the best here anyways

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.990 
reason it works the best here anyways
I'm<00:01:11.770> gonna<00:01:11.920> skip<00:01:12.280> ahead<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.640> where<00:01:12.910> it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
I'm gonna skip ahead to where it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.820 
I'm gonna skip ahead to where it
actually<00:01:13.119> works<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:13.660> i<00:01:13.720> can<00:01:13.869> show<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.140> what
