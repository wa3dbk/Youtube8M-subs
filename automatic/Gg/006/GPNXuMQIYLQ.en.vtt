this notebook starts at 50 at 1499 so

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
this notebook starts at 50 at 1499 so
it's<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.100> bit<00:00:20.189> more<00:00:20.430> expensive<00:00:20.730> than<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it's a little bit more expensive than a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.710 
it's a little bit more expensive than a
regular<00:00:21.900> ultrabook<00:00:22.640> which<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> why<00:00:23.970> Samsung

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
regular ultrabook which is why Samsung

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
regular ultrabook which is why Samsung
doesn't<00:00:25.050> consider<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.590> part<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.460> whole

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
doesn't consider it part of that whole

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990 
doesn't consider it part of that whole
grouping<00:00:27.599> however<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.160> smaller<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
grouping however it is smaller and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.659 
grouping however it is smaller and
lighter<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:30.840> well<00:00:31.650> almost<00:00:31.949> almost<00:00:32.309> every

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
lighter than well almost almost every

lighter than well almost almost every
other<00:00:32.700> ultrabook<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> market<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.649> weighs

other ultrabook on the market it weighs

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030 
other ultrabook on the market it weighs
two<00:00:35.070> point<00:00:35.340> three<00:00:35.430> pounds<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.620> open<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
two point three pounds and if we open it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.290 
two point three pounds and if we open it
up<00:00:39.260> you'll<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> 13<00:00:42.149> inch

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
up you'll see that it's a 13 inch

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
up you'll see that it's a 13 inch
display<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.559> goes<00:00:43.710> nearly<00:00:44.190> edge<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.640> edge

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
display and it goes nearly edge to edge

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
display and it goes nearly edge to edge
so<00:00:45.120> they're<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> fit<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.930> 13<00:00:46.350> inch<00:00:46.500> display

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so they're able to fit a 13 inch display

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.810 
so they're able to fit a 13 inch display
inside<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.120> system<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> would<00:00:49.140> normally<00:00:49.289> be

inside a system that would normally be

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
inside a system that would normally be
reserved<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:50.850> only<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.780> 12<00:00:52.110> inch<00:00:52.320> screen<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.829> we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
reserved for only a 12 inch screen if we

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.209 
reserved for only a 12 inch screen if we
take<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> look<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> fact<00:00:54.329> compared<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
take a look in fact compared to the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.930 
take a look in fact compared to the
macbook<00:00:56.579> air<00:00:57.000> 13<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.500> footprint<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
macbook air 13 the footprint for the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.349 
macbook air 13 the footprint for the
samsung<00:01:00.449> series<00:01:00.840> 9<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.640> smaller<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
samsung series 9 is a lot smaller you

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
samsung series 9 is a lot smaller you
can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> although<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.220> are

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
can see it like that although they are

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
can see it like that although they are
about<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:05.909> thickness<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> samsung<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
about the same thickness the samsung is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
about the same thickness the samsung is
probably<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.060> lighter<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> low

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
probably a little bit lighter and low

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
probably a little bit lighter and low
bit<00:01:10.650> thinner<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:10.920> should<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.880> also

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
bit thinner i should say it's also

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.070 
bit thinner i should say it's also
weighs<00:01:12.450> 2.6<00:01:13.170> pounds<00:01:13.490> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.869> light

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
weighs 2.6 pounds which is not as light

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
weighs 2.6 pounds which is not as light
as<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> toshiba<00:01:17.549> za<00:01:17.759> 30<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.330> 2.4<00:01:19.020> but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
turning on at the moment but we can get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.390 
turning on at the moment but we can get
through<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.859> imagine<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.340> very

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
through but you can imagine it's very

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
through but you can imagine it's very
bright<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.879> fact<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.359> one<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.689> brighter

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
bright in fact it's one of the brighter

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
displays we've seen the keyboard here is

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.129 
displays we've seen the keyboard here is
also<00:02:31.349> backlit<00:02:32.030> which<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.150> also<00:02:33.389> nice<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.989> it's

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
also backlit which is also nice but it's

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.390 
also backlit which is also nice but it's
not<00:02:34.319> as<00:02:34.590> bright<00:02:35.129> as<00:02:36.349> say<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.829> macbook<00:02:38.040> air

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

however this is a pre-production unit we

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.459 
however this is a pre-production unit we
should<00:02:41.069> stress<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> things<00:02:43.049> on

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
should stress so some of the things on

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.920 
should stress so some of the things on
