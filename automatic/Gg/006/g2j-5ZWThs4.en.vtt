amazingly<00:01:43.950> fast<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> probably<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
amazingly fast and probably because it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
amazingly fast and probably because it
was<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.430> Derrick<00:01:47.430> Rose<00:01:47.610> who<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
was made for Derrick Rose who is if you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
was made for Derrick Rose who is if you
don't<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.899> basketball<00:01:49.140> he's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.130> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
don't know basketball he's a very very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.870 
don't know basketball he's a very very
fast<00:01:50.820> guard<00:01:51.210> he<00:01:52.200> likes<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> go<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> one

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
fast guard he likes to go from the one

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
fast guard he likes to go from the one
end<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> court<00:01:54.360> suit<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> other<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
end the court suit up to the other and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
end the court suit up to the other and
he<00:01:55.500> likes<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.250> blow<00:01:56.520> by<00:01:56.759> his<00:01:56.909> defenders

really really fast in them and the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
really really fast in them and the
support<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.950> great<00:02:02.250> obviously<00:02:02.969> I've<00:02:03.060> injured

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
