00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.870
 so now we have the black rapid 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.540
 Body 7 camera belt and although sign of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.180
 characterized by being a very thin one 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 but comfortable pad on the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.539
 blame ergonomically ergonomically shaped 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:30.590
 the whole and the typical fast 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.239
 Camera access via the over 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.690
 diagonal over which the original stand 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.690
 good here 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.940
 I'll show you how to do it now 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.489
 the camera attaches as the system with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.610
 individual works the body has 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 the advantage that you have different 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
 industries can bring up too much 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.299
 ten different sizes for 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.089
 smartphones for larger smartphones for 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.670
 small batteries then I'll show you too 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.400
 another important accessory and that is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 that is the stabilizer that drives you 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.720
 The attach that is there for the good 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 to stabilize under the arm 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.220
 when cycling there is still 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.420
 optionally now a wrist strap around 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 to switch quickly between 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.050
 Camera and handshake will be the one 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.840
 strap off click on the men's sleep 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.990
 I'll say that again 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 then there is a theft protection 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 special he protect with steel is the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 man at the rear of the strap can attach 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 and for people with static 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.409
 There are also accessories in accessories 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.110
 still for motors for arca swiss 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.730
 special accessories so that you can directly 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.830
 the quick release plate is good for the camera 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.390
 The big advantage can be attached 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.070
 some of the credit camera is golden 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 that the straps are not up here at the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.650
 straps are attached but below 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.320
 the tripod screw and thereby one has 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.030
 here, for example, when photographing no word 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 more about the hand dangling 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.630
 maybe even sticking out into the picture 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.149
 you bring the mountain webcode with this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.970
 that is a very stable one 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:20.720
 system that has shit okay that again 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:24.189
 what textile could we have 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.189
 take the new as the holes 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.550
 so the special to a blackberry ans 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.410
 ear 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.700
 the special on a board camera 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.379
 it was that they were down at 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.720
 be attached to the tripod thread 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.780
 that has the advantage that you can not do more 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 about the wrist any good 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.670
 away the plants are the objective 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.980
 you can enter attached link entirely 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.120
 just about this phase of the camera 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.530
 adapter is of course 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.049
 scope of delivery included 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.299
 it's so small on the back 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.120
 recess the senate under pressure in 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.700
 So that's what rubber really does 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 get stuck first purely on tight 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.280
 screw and I'll still take it 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.799
 once the carabiners of jan is well off 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.540
 to really screw it down then 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.260
 sits bombproof there you can too 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.930
 serious profi cameras 1d mark something 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.160
 everything is objective with 17 200 l 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.040
 no problem that holds the whole 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.130
 system out of what's new now 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.260
 optional accessory is the black 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.299
 rabbit hand loop because for me 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 one of the biggest advantages of the board web 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.680
 it system the camera at any time 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.359
 can lose weight again 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.819
 and now you have the new one 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.470
 Wrist strap also the possibility 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.510
 quickly to sleep 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.150
 I like to do that around wendy 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.540
 street photography says that here 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.190
 Carry camera over the wrist strap or 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.959
 take pictures so that I can stop 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.220
 does not fall over the possesses 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.609
 Wrist strap for me a very 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.829
 useful accessory for people with the 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.160
 There is also a tripod 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.590
 optional to buy manfrotto tripod 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.970
 plates there is a small special woman 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.519
 the one through the quick release plate 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.889
 from manfrotto by screwing and also 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.840
 Here you can then the strap in the bar 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.430
 Clicking on this bar is especially for 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.440
 black rabbit cameraman made and 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.530
 that also holds for heavy cameras 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.800
 for people who are compatible with ak swiss 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.070
 Static work there is a tripod 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.360
 plate of catcher is so this 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.340
 not from black rabbit itself this 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.400
 people from the pik design have this sap 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.889
 Represents found and have the latest 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.889
 also capturing with a clip 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.740
 equipped which one can use 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.229
 click here the belt 1 of black 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.699
 rabbit the hero also has heavy cameras 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.740
 so that it is for these two 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:57.530
 possibilities really a good solution 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.479
 there is the latte then stay tuned and in 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.340
 The citizens click the belt 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.979
 clicked out if you like that 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.870
 the camera tripod puts you now 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.000
 again a special feature all the work 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.189
 rapid-kamereten have the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.129
 have the so-called stopper year 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.930
 are the bumper 1 rear 1 front 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.419
 that is, if not now 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.060
 you photographed both round and 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.090
 the camera just can not build away 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.680
 If you walk, she would be here otherwise 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.789
 swinging so high what can hold everything 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.080
 do not happen when you take pictures 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.319
 you make the front band was after 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.279
 Above one says photographed stays well in 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.830
 where he is 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.990
 when photographing the highly visible 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.879
 how to move backwards you can 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.060
 He asked them over the back bench here 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:47.270
 is back in position with the carabiner 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.680
 pull and then there is the optional 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.039
 so-called forearm step one here 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.860
 It can be fastened to the belt again 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.289
 so here then back and then 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.789
 he is well fixed under his arm and can 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.610
 do not move here anymore 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.289
 that makes sense if you firstly 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.120
 so that the camera would like to run when you 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.219
 bike finished or similar maybe 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.569
 even doing sports activities and 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.569
 because you can namely the rear bank 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.580
 are still back wrote the camera 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.259
 also with the second ball on the back 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.909
 It seemed that everyone was back 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.889
 can not prove 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.860
 people that was here then you sit 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.689
 The camera remains fixed, so to speak behind 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.510
 At the back that's just on the bike 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.220
 meaningful 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.920
 I have been together since I hang here 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:37.050
 can and can go if you are now 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.180
 traveling in areas where there are problems 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.460
 with theft you can give here completely 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.950
 Simply he protect option to 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.930
 Buy what I think nice that is 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.220
 so that you can buy that optional 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.440
 because I always need a steel cable 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.420
 the girth but if you answer is where 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.700
 you need it, you just do it 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.250
 behind a camera strap over the 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.980
 river and wants to top it are trapped 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.390
 and then you have no chances 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.860
 the will by allegedly thinks 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.240
 cut or something similar and I will 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.220
 now the three for you 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.720
 bags show I'll be one 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.280
 Attachment to the strap I say that 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.010
 right now in the current 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.420
 session the one on black rabbit 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.890
 though the body can attach one though 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.800
 special because he also special for 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.390
 It is designed to dominate this 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.100
 This theory gives 1 2 and 3 in 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.490
 different sizes I have one 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.590
 attached and indeed over this small 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.510
 evil here for that wants the loop 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.620
 appropriate if you have more than one bag 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.960
 you can also need one here 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.960
 second because already the third install 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.360
 simply by going here the course 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.480
 Opens the bag to sleep over it 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.010
 and then the bags are attached what 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.300
 I also really like that one the 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.910
 bags do not always have to 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.040
 So you do not need it you take it 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.600
 again so it is not built-in 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.220
 the bag but you really can 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.220
 Optionally match
