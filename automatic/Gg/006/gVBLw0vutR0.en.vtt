now<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.420> 48-point<00:00:28.140> edge<00:00:28.349> mod<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.880> good

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
now for a 48-point edge mod it's good

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.080 
now for a 48-point edge mod it's good
plus<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.689> makes<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.170> lot<00:00:31.349> quieter<00:00:32.099> so

nice and rounded do it to the other four

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:14.469 
nice and rounded do it to the other four
remaining<00:01:03.840> sides<00:01:11.869> now<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.650> four<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.340> them

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
remaining sides now this four of them

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.120 
remaining sides now this four of them
over<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.810> too<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.409> over<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.890> too

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is you're going to do them to all all 12

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.609 
is you're going to do them to all all 12
edges<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.369> four<00:01:23.610> sides<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:25.380> why<00:01:25.500> it's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
edges on all four sides that's why it's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.010 
edges on all four sides that's why it's
called<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.799> 48-point<00:01:26.369> everyone<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
called a 48-point everyone it's not that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.859 
called a 48-point everyone it's not that
time<00:01:28.530> consuming<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.659> even

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
time consuming actually it's not even

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.760 
time consuming actually it's not even
that<00:01:30.960> hard<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.560> yeah<00:01:32.100> try<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that hard so yeah try it and this is the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
that hard so yeah try it and this is the
v-cube<00:01:35.130> mod<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.979> have<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.659> corner<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> then

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
v-cube mod you have the corner and then

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
v-cube mod you have the corner and then
over<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> run<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.280> finger

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
over here when you run your finger

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.830 
over here when you run your finger
across<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.860> you'll<00:01:43.860> feel<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> bump

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
across all of them you'll feel that bump

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
across all of them you'll feel that bump
yeah<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.530> rid<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.860> bumps<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
yeah you get rid of that bumps and it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.880 
yeah you get rid of that bumps and it
will<00:01:47.850> cut<00:01:48.060> corners<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
will cut corners a little better than it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
will cut corners a little better than it
used<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.479> I'll<00:01:51.600> also<00:01:51.630> inverse<00:01:52.320> cut<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
used to and I'll also inverse cut a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.350 
used to and I'll also inverse cut a
little<00:01:53.540> more<00:01:54.540> than<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> used<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.770> yeah

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
little more than it used to so yeah

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.290 
little more than it used to so yeah
and<00:01:58.840> once<00:01:59.110> you're<00:01:59.350> done<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.620> that<00:02:03.030> send<00:02:04.030> it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
and once you're done with that send it

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.070 
and once you're done with that send it
until<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:04.690> smooth<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:06.510> voila<00:02:07.510> you're<00:02:07.900> done

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
until it's smooth and voila you're done

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.990 
until it's smooth and voila you're done
now<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.890> all<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.070> corners<00:02:09.520> all<00:02:09.789> three

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
now do it to all the corners all three

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.840 
now do it to all the corners all three
sides<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:12.330> 24<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:14.350> same<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.890> was<00:02:15.610> half

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
sides that's 24 the same is it was half

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.300 
sides that's 24 the same is it was half
the<00:02:15.880> edge<00:02:16.360> mode<00:02:16.570> but<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.020> really<00:02:17.890> really

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the edge mode but it's really really

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.720 
the edge mode but it's really really
easy<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.380> doesn't<00:02:20.380> take<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.890> long<00:02:20.950> so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
easy to do doesn't take that long so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.110 
easy to do doesn't take that long so
yeah<00:02:22.090> fry<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.540> I'll<00:02:23.080> make<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.560> better<00:02:24.120> well
