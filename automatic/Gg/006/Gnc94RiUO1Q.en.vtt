00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.570
 what I mean more via his weblog in this free democracy but that is something 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.550
 different 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.180
 yes or must be dictatorial 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.790

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.700
 you unknowingly mean nothing 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.500
 through the normal scrolling I find it very interesting 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.879
 for example last year 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.769

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.719
 you have nothing on the basis of outside the neighborhood the thunder mountain barbaric 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 In recent years you have to find out what happened 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.780
 would leak information and see is that information but that is not so this is 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.729
 your own subjects assume that happens that is the other way around yes that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 seems clear to me

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.780

 what were women going to build up 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.950

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.810
 that it has been strong in recent times from china and india 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100
