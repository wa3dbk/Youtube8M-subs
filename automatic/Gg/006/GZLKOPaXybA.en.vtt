interface<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.400> computer<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> since<00:01:07.049> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
interface for my computer and since it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.800 
interface for my computer and since it's
a<00:01:07.320> serial<00:01:07.770> connection<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> changes

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
a serial connection you see the changes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.210 
a serial connection you see the changes
immediately<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> radio<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.100> now

immediately on the radio so right now
I'm<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> PSK<00:01:12.299> frequency<00:01:13.080> 14<00:01:13.409> point<00:01:13.710> o7o

I'm on the PSK frequency 14 point o7o
makers<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.750> computer<00:01:16.110> I'll<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
makers and on my computer I'll just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
makers and on my computer I'll just
change<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> fourteen<00:01:17.430> point<00:01:17.729> zero<00:01:18.330> eight

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
change that to fourteen point zero eight

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.820 
change that to fourteen point zero eight
zero<00:01:18.900> eight<00:01:20.720> nine<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.680> I'm

zero eight nine so you can see as I'm

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
zero eight nine so you can see as I'm
scanning<00:01:23.070> around<00:01:23.310> I'll<00:01:23.520> scan<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
scanning around I'll scan up and I'm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
scanning around I'll scan up and I'm
just<00:01:25.799> using<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.040> mouse<00:01:26.250> wheel<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:27.090> change<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
just using my mouse wheel to change the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
just using my mouse wheel to change the
frequency<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.340> reflected

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
frequency up there and it's reflected

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
frequency up there and it's reflected
right<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> radio<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> things<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
right on the radio so things that I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
right on the radio so things that I
would<00:01:34.470> normally<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.280> type

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
would normally and I can also just type

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
would normally and I can also just type
the<00:01:35.670> figures<00:01:35.909> I'll<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> 1407<00:01:37.229> zero

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the figures I'll go back to 1407 zero

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.840 
the figures I'll go back to 1407 zero
zero<00:01:38.340> zero<00:01:40.009> things<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.159> changing<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> power

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
zero zero things like changing the power

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
zero zero things like changing the power
output<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.720> half<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.049> watt<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.439> y<00:01:43.560> two

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
output you know half a watt one y two

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.310 
output you know half a watt one y two
and<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> half<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> five<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> were<00:01:46.170> doing

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and a half to five and if I were doing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.010 
and a half to five and if I were doing
it<00:01:46.380> manually<00:01:46.680> I'd<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.430> function

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
it manually I'd have to go to function

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.060 
it manually I'd have to go to function
then<00:01:49.020> obviously<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> time

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
then obviously I'm right there this time

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
then obviously I'm right there this time
to<00:01:50.189> say<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:50.399> somewhere<00:01:51.030> else<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to say I'm somewhere else and I have to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.980 
to say I'm somewhere else and I have to
go<00:01:52.829> function<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.520> scan<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> selector

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
go function and then scan the selector

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
go function and then scan the selector
knob<00:01:55.549> one<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> time<00:01:56.939> until<00:01:58.579> I<00:01:59.579> found<00:01:59.880> power

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
knob one at a time until I found power

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
knob one at a time until I found power
and<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.350> click<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.939> only<00:02:03.060> way

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and then you click it and the only way

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.399 
and then you click it and the only way
you<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.869> doing<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.170> how<00:02:04.259> much

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you know what you're doing and how much

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
you know what you're doing and how much
power<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.009> those<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.579> bars<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
power it is is those little bars on the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
power it is is those little bars on the
bottom<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.719> actually<00:02:07.049> backwards<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
bottom then it's actually backwards to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.490 
bottom then it's actually backwards to
it<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.190> would<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> no

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it you would think it would be so no

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160 
it you would think it would be so no
bars<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.950> five<00:02:11.129> watts<00:02:11.430> three<00:02:12.090> bars<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.540> half

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
bars is five watts three bars is half

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.580 
bars is five watts three bars is half
what<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.709> that's<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> lowest<00:02:14.190> power<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:16.349> so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
what so that's the lowest power and so

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.500 
what so that's the lowest power and so
on<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.459> from<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.760> interface<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.360> just

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
on but from this interface I can just

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.260 
on but from this interface I can just
you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.870> click<00:02:19.110> half<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> lot<00:02:20.010> boom<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.150> then

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you know click half a lot boom and then

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.300 
you know click half a lot boom and then
on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> radio<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.349> see<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.920> guess<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
on the radio you can see the I guess I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.820 
on the radio you can see the I guess I
was<00:02:23.430> back<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.730> some<00:02:23.819> explanation<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.830> focus

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
was back for some explanation but focus

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.290 
was back for some explanation but focus
there's<00:02:26.250> half<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.610> lot<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
there's half a lot and then on the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.120 
there's half a lot and then on the
interface<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.470> go<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.739> wide<00:02:28.920> you'll

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
interface I can go to one wide you'll

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
interface I can go to one wide you'll
see<00:02:29.250> two<00:02:29.400> bars<00:02:29.640> two<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> half<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.140> three

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
see two bars two and a half was three

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.570 
see two bars two and a half was three

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.890 
changing things like the which antenna
connection<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.360> radio<00:02:39.569> I'm<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> be

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
connection on the radio I'm going to be

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
connection on the radio I'm going to be
using<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.709> right<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.190> rear<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.670> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
using so right now it's on the rear so I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.089 
using so right now it's on the rear so I
can<00:02:41.850> go<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.000> front<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.560> hear<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.830> relay

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
can go to front and you hear the relay

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.130 
can go to front and you hear the relay
click<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> radio<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.150> now<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.390> looking

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
click in the radio so now it's looking

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.820 
click in the radio so now it's looking
at<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> front<00:02:46.530> antenna<00:02:47.330> back<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.540> rear<00:02:48.830> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
at the front antenna back to rear you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.860 
at the front antenna back to rear you
can<00:02:49.860> set<00:02:50.100> all<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.310> pre<00:02:50.550> Peter<00:02:51.360> frequencies

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
can set all your pre Peter frequencies

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.479 
can set all your pre Peter frequencies
your<00:02:51.989> mode<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.860> I'm<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.100> lower<00:02:53.220> sideband

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
your mode so I'm going to lower sideband

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.740 
your mode so I'm going to lower sideband
they're<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.450> easy

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
they're just that easy

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.140 
they're just that easy
oh<00:02:55.010> there<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.930> I'll<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.049> back<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.380> digital

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
oh there it is I'll go back to digital

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.340 
oh there it is I'll go back to digital
and<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.480> scan<00:03:00.660> up<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.959> down<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.140> band

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and so you can scan up and down the band

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.410 
and so you can scan up and down the band
you<00:03:01.769> know<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:02.100> dragging<00:03:02.400> these<00:03:02.489> sliders<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
you know just dragging these sliders you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.360 
you know just dragging these sliders you
can<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> frequency<00:03:03.840> changing<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
can see the frequency changing so to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.509 
can see the frequency changing so to
1406<00:03:06.120> nine<00:03:06.269> seven<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.810> zero<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.340> there<00:03:08.459> you

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
1406 nine seven to zero and there you

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.740 
1406 nine seven to zero and there you
can<00:03:08.610> see<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.819> on<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> radio<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> mean<00:03:09.630> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
can see it on the radio so I mean it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.759 
can see it on the radio so I mean it's
it's<00:03:10.200> pretty<00:03:10.709> slick<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.019> also<00:03:13.170> this

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.069 

and<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:39.790> see<00:03:39.939> I'm<00:03:40.030> not<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.390> frequency

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and so see I'm not on the frequency

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.709 
and so see I'm not on the frequency
there<00:03:41.290> should<00:03:41.439> be<00:03:41.469> 40<00:03:41.829> no<00:03:41.920> 700<00:03:42.340> roughly<00:03:42.790> it's

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:43.719 
there should be 40 no 700 roughly it's

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.449 
there should be 40 no 700 roughly it's
like<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.900> need<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.139> do<00:03:44.319> this<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:45.129> know<00:03:45.219> to<00:03:45.280> get

like I need to do this you know to get
close<00:03:45.670> or<00:03:45.969> I<00:03:48.120> can't<00:03:49.120> just<00:03:49.239> go<00:03:49.329> back<00:03:49.359> here<00:03:49.719> and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
close or I can't just go back here and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:57.869 
close or I can't just go back here and
seven<00:03:50.889> zero<00:03:51.069> zero<00:03:51.189> zero<00:03:51.749> I'm<00:03:52.749> right<00:03:53.109> on<00:03:56.879> so

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
seven zero zero zero I'm right on so

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.839 
seven zero zero zero I'm right on so
here's<00:03:58.209> what<00:03:58.659> PSP<00:03:59.500> 31<00:03:59.950> looks<00:04:00.219> like<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.700> just

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
here's what PSP 31 looks like and just

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.179 
here's what PSP 31 looks like and just
select<00:04:01.209> on<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.689> these<00:04:01.840> signals<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:03.099> you

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
select on one of these signals then you

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.929 
select on one of these signals then you
can<00:04:03.310> see<00:04:03.430> it's<00:04:03.579> text<00:04:04.359> up<00:04:04.480> here<00:04:05.939> somebody's

I don't know what that is flat number

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.789 
I don't know what that is flat number
and<00:04:14.200> back<00:04:14.439> to<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.709> lay<00:04:14.889> on<00:04:14.919> Y<00:04:15.549> is<00:04:15.609> 0<00:04:16.199> or<00:04:17.199> y<00:04:17.380> OU<00:04:17.410> 8

frequencies up to roughly 80 and you see
there's<00:04:42.439> a<00:04:42.740> really<00:04:43.069> signal<00:04:43.400> might<00:04:44.180> not<00:04:44.330> be

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
there's a really signal might not be

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.670 
there's a really signal might not be
ready

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.830 

I<00:04:47.770> don't<00:04:48.400> even<00:04:48.520> know<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:48.850> is

anyway pretty cool it's a pretty cool

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.190 
anyway pretty cool it's a pretty cool
interface<00:04:55.120> being<00:04:55.510> all<00:04:55.570> serial<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.080> it's

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
interface being all serial and it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.420 
interface being all serial and it's
actually<00:04:56.470> pretty<00:04:56.620> fast<00:04:56.860> ever<00:04:57.100> running<00:04:57.280> at

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
actually pretty fast ever running at

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.780 
actually pretty fast ever running at
38,000<00:04:58.180> odd<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.860> haven't<00:05:00.490> had<00:05:00.610> any

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
38,000 odd and it's a haven't had any

so having this is my like I said a ham
radio<00:05:07.810> computer<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.490> it's<00:05:09.610> got<00:05:09.730> like<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.880> 19

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
radio computer so it's got like a 19

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.360 
radio computer so it's got like a 19
inch<00:05:10.270> monitor<00:05:10.389> but<00:05:10.900> compared<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.950> interface

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
inch monitor but compared that interface

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.520 
inch monitor but compared that interface
to<00:05:12.669> trying<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.240> use<00:05:13.389> that<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.960> four<00:05:14.350> knobs

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
to trying to use that and four knobs

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.250 
to trying to use that and four knobs
three<00:05:14.950> knobs<00:05:16.500> it's<00:05:17.500> actually<00:05:17.800> pretty<00:05:17.980> slick
