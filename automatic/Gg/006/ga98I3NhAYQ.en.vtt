updated a little bit chrome wheels look
better<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> forza<00:01:34.380> horizon<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.070> i<00:01:35.750> think

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
better now and forza horizon but i think

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929 
better now and forza horizon but i think
that<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.860> important<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.909> think

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that the more important thing to think

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.179 
that the more important thing to think
about<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> fact<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.950> have

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
about here is the fact that there have

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
about here is the fact that there have
been<00:01:41.220> no<00:01:42.530> no<00:01:43.530> new<00:01:43.890> wheels<00:01:44.220> since<00:01:45.180> forza<00:01:45.810> two

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
been no no new wheels since forza two

think I mean I i would guess that all of
the<00:03:08.310> necessary<00:03:08.490> rights<00:03:09.150> are<00:03:09.390> there<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.750> maybe

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the necessary rights are there but maybe

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.670 
the necessary rights are there but maybe
not<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.440> know<00:03:10.560> game<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.100> game<00:03:11.280> but<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:13.500> yeah<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
not you know game to game but but yeah I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.170 
not you know game to game but but yeah I

mean if they could have them in Forza to
there's<00:03:15.420> no<00:03:15.630> reason<00:03:16.170> why<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:17.130> shouldn't<00:03:17.370> be

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
there's no reason why they shouldn't be

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.530 
there's no reason why they shouldn't be

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
not only add to the customization aspect

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.950 
not only add to the customization aspect
but<00:04:04.290> wheels<00:04:05.040> really<00:04:05.550> define<00:04:06.030> your<00:04:06.240> car<00:04:06.540> you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960
