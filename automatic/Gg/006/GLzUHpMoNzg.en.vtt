rifle with a hybrid scope with a hybrid

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.790 
rifle with a hybrid scope with a hybrid
site<00:00:37.720> that<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:37.930> can<00:00:38.050> basically<00:00:38.170> flick<00:00:38.530> back

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
site that you can basically flick back

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.610 
site that you can basically flick back
and<00:00:39.010> forward<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:40.210> somehow<00:00:40.810> it<00:00:41.080> also<00:00:41.320> changes

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
and forward and somehow it also changes

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.900 
and forward and somehow it also changes
kind<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.860> like<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.040> rate<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.190> fire<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.700> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
kind of like the rate of fire and the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.850 
kind of like the rate of fire and the
accuracy<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.480> well<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:44.110> there's<00:00:44.410> an<00:00:44.470> SMG<00:00:44.710> you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
accuracy as well so there's an SMG you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.680 
accuracy as well so there's an SMG you
get<00:00:45.010> better<00:00:45.160> at<00:00:45.310> five<00:00:45.550> more<00:00:45.850> recalls<00:00:46.240> an<00:00:46.420> aiúa

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
get better at five more recalls an aiúa

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.970 
get better at five more recalls an aiúa
let's<00:00:47.050> wrap<00:00:47.200> fire<00:00:47.410> but<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.710> get<00:00:47.860> more

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
let's wrap fire but you get more

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.230 
let's wrap fire but you get more
accurate<00:00:48.340> as<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.760> can<00:00:48.880> see<00:00:48.970> something

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
accurate as you can see something

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.820 
accurate as you can see something
attacked<00:00:49.450> be<00:00:49.630> burn<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.230> switches<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.560> this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
attacked be burn and it switches to this

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.160 
attacked be burn and it switches to this
um<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.760> hybrid<00:00:52.270> scope<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:52.870> switches

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
um this hybrid scope and the switches

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.140 
um this hybrid scope and the switches
from<00:00:53.230> an<00:00:53.380> AR<00:00:53.620> this<00:00:53.950> switches<00:00:54.340> from<00:00:54.430> an<00:00:54.579> SMG<00:00:54.880> to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
from an AR this switches from an SMG to

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.810 
from an AR this switches from an SMG to
an<00:00:55.270> hour<00:00:55.540> now<00:00:56.440> basically<00:00:56.680> this<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.340> kind<00:00:57.730> of

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
an hour now basically this is kind of

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.490 
an hour now basically this is kind of
accomplishable<00:00:58.420> purely<00:00:59.079> for<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.230> fact<00:00:59.440> that

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
accomplishable purely for the fact that

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.830 
accomplishable purely for the fact that
this<00:00:59.890> is<00:00:59.950> a<00:01:00.300> real<00:01:01.300> life<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.630> would<00:01:01.690> be<00:01:01.810> a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
this is a real life it would be a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.690 
this is a real life it would be a
bullpup<00:01:02.230> rifle<00:01:02.290> which<00:01:03.100> basically<00:01:03.400> means<00:01:03.579> the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
bullpup rifle which basically means the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.999 
bullpup rifle which basically means the
magazine<00:01:04.210> sits<00:01:04.570> behind<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.229> barrel<00:01:07.799> dude<00:01:08.799> go

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
floor to the how floor to how I play and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.710 
floor to the how floor to how I play and
it<00:04:08.850> does<00:04:08.940> make<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.090> little<00:04:09.300> bit<00:04:09.390> difficult<00:04:09.510> for

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
it does make a little bit difficult for

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.540 
it does make a little bit difficult for
commentary<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.290> sun<00:04:10.440> because<00:04:10.680> sometimes<00:04:11.340> when

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
commentary on sun because sometimes when

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.480 
commentary on sun because sometimes when
I'm<00:04:11.670> trying<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.940> talk<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.150> lot<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.400> keep<00:04:14.400> my

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
I'm trying to talk a lot and keep my

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.580 
I'm trying to talk a lot and keep my
video<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.880> interesting<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.450> find<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.080> hard<00:04:16.230> to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
video is interesting I find it hard to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.680 
video is interesting I find it hard to
play<00:04:17.370> well<00:04:17.610> at<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.790> same<00:04:17.940> time<00:04:18.209> which<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.660> a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
play well at the same time which is a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.600 
play well at the same time which is a
river<00:04:19.560> down<00:04:19.620> for<00:04:19.950> all<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.190> know<00:04:20.310> again<00:04:20.459> I

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
river down for all but you know again I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.949 
river down for all but you know again I
guess<00:04:20.820> if<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.270> practice<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.870> i'll

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
guess if I practice that it i'll

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.710 
guess if I practice that it i'll
probably<00:04:22.140> get<00:04:22.320> better<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.310> I'm<00:04:23.720> let's

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
probably get better at it so I'm let's

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.560 
probably get better at it so I'm let's
switch<00:04:24.900> back<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.230> SMG<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.390> let's<00:04:27.390> show

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
switch back to the SMG and let's show

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.930 
switch back to the SMG and let's show
you<00:04:27.630> what<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.200> thing<00:04:28.550> see<00:04:29.550> as<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.730> can<00:04:29.820> see

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
you what this thing see as you can see

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.670 
you what this thing see as you can see
at<00:04:30.030> long<00:04:30.150> range<00:04:30.360> S&amp;G<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.050> big<00:04:31.170> no-no<00:04:31.320> switch

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
at long range S&amp;G is a big no-no switch

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.890 
at long range S&amp;G is a big no-no switch
to<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.890> am<00:04:32.190> boom<00:04:32.550> you're<00:04:32.910> done<00:04:33.120> space<00:04:33.690> key

to the am boom you're done space key

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.270 
to the am boom you're done space key
it's<00:04:34.170> like<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.320> short-range<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.860> medium<00:04:35.130> range

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's like a short-range to medium range

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.490 
it's like a short-range to medium range
weapon<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.670> is<00:04:35.760> great<00:04:36.030> i<00:04:36.060> love<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:37.380> can
