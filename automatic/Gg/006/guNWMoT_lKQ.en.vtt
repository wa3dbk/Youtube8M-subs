this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> 2<00:00:34.050> ohm<00:00:34.200> design<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.680> means

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this is a 2 ohm design which means

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
this is a 2 ohm design which means
basically<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> pulls<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.270> power

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
basically that it pulls out more power

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
basically that it pulls out more power
from<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.380> amplifier<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.489> head<00:00:38.760> unit<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
from the amplifier or the head unit that

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
from the amplifier or the head unit that
you're<00:00:39.270> drawing<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.530> power

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you're drawing it from right more power

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
you're drawing it from right more power
equals<00:00:41.340> better<00:00:41.820> sound<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.510> works<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
equals better sound it just works that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.560 
equals better sound it just works that
way<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> designs

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
way that's right one of the designs

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.400 
way that's right one of the designs
features<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
features I like about this is the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
features I like about this is the
tweeter<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.280> tweeter<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> nice

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tweeter the tweeter of this is a nice

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.939 
tweeter the tweeter of this is a nice
size<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> metal<00:00:50.550> matrix<00:00:50.760> dome<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.710> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
size it's a metal matrix dome so really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.540 
size it's a metal matrix dome so really
radiates<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.329> sound<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.980> most

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
radiates a lot of sound out and in most

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
radiates a lot of sound out and in most
models<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> rotate<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.899> too<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
models you can rotate it too so when you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
models you can rotate it too so when you
rotate<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.480> direct<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> highs

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
rotate that you can direct the highs

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.100 
rotate that you can direct the highs
we're<00:01:01.800> real<00:01:02.129> directional<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.870> perfect

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we're real directional and get perfect

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
we're real directional and get perfect
sounding<00:01:04.949> sweet<00:01:05.280> spot<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.390> up

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
sounding sweet spot you know right up

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
sounding sweet spot you know right up
there<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> feels<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.439> you're<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there so it feels like you're right you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
there so it feels like you're right you
can<00:01:08.189> sort<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> audio<00:01:08.909> point<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can sort of on the audio point up the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
can sort of on the audio point up the
highs<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> doors<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.939> absolute

should<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.950> sure<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.850> help

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
should be sure and this will help

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
should be sure and this will help
compensate<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> little

question if you don't like your highs
too<00:01:20.909> bright<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.140> tamped

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
too bright or you know like I'm tamped

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
too bright or you know like I'm tamped
animal<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.490> attenuate<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.090> will

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
animal but this will attenuate it will

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
animal but this will attenuate it will
drop<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> highs<00:01:24.810> 3<00:01:25.500> DBS<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.250> pretty<00:01:26.640> big

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
drop the highs 3 DBS that's pretty big

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670 
drop the highs 3 DBS that's pretty big
drop<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> another<00:01:28.200> level<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
drop so you have another level of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
drop so you have another level of
customization<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> highs<00:01:29.909> sure<00:01:30.420> sort

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
customization with the highs sure sort

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
customization with the highs sure sort
of<00:01:30.900> smooth<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of smooth it out a bit if you go that

important<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.420> durable<00:02:07.079> than<00:02:07.409> say<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
important it's more durable than say a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.770 
important it's more durable than say a
foam<00:02:08.129> surround<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> might<00:02:09.179> find<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.569> lot

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
foam surround like you might find a lot

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
foam surround like you might find a lot
of<00:02:09.959> factory<00:02:10.410> speakers<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.790> also<00:02:11.940> allows

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
of factory speakers and it also allows

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
of factory speakers and it also allows
for<00:02:12.330> greater<00:02:12.750> excursion

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
for greater excursion

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.310 
for greater excursion
of<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.790> cone<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.420> basically<00:02:15.660> allows<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
of the cone here basically allows it to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.470 
of the cone here basically allows it to
move<00:02:16.500> farther<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> further<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.640> which

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
move farther out and further down which

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.260 
move farther out and further down which
gives<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.960> more<00:02:18.990> sound<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:20.700> power<00:02:20.850> now

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
gives you more sound and more power now

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.670 
gives you more sound and more power now
you<00:02:21.330> hit<00:02:21.540> them<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> head<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> lot

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you hit them all in the head there a lot

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
you hit them all in the head there a lot
of<00:02:22.710> excursion<00:02:23.400> lightweight<00:02:23.970> strong<00:02:24.330> material

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
of excursion lightweight strong material

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.120 
of excursion lightweight strong material
you'll<00:02:24.960> get<00:02:25.110> good<00:02:25.290> mids<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.590> lows<00:02:25.680> that's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you'll get good mids and lows that's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.480 
you'll get good mids and lows that's
right

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
right

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.310 
right
I<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> crossover<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.990> comes<00:02:28.200> with

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
I like the crossover that comes with

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.620 
I like the crossover that comes with
this<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:29.090> component<00:02:30.090> speakers<00:02:30.450> will

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
this you know component speakers will

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.360 
this you know component speakers will
come<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:30.930> external<00:02:31.230> crossovers<00:02:31.980> earth<00:02:32.130> with

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
come with external crossovers earth with

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
come with external crossovers earth with
high<00:02:32.490> quality<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:33.470> capacitors<00:02:34.470> resistors

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
high quality of capacitors resistors

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
high quality of capacitors resistors
make<00:02:35.250> sure<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> highs<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:36.060> where<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.270> need

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
make sure the highs get where they need

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.150 
make sure the highs get where they need
to<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> loads<00:02:37.110> where<00:02:37.890> they're<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
to go and the loads where they're you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920 
to go and the loads where they're you
need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.240> see<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.450> too<00:02:39.570> often<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
need to you don't see it too often that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.780 
need to you don't see it too often that
a<00:02:40.050> full-range<00:02:40.680> speaker<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.459> will<00:02:41.640> have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
a full-range speaker like this will have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.730 
a full-range speaker like this will have
an<00:02:41.940> external<00:02:42.240> crossover<00:02:42.990> right<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.620> has

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
an external crossover right and that has

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.440 
an external crossover right and that has
a<00:02:43.770> big<00:02:44.130> effect<00:02:44.310> on<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:44.760> good<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> sound<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
a big effect on how good the sound is

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.900 
a big effect on how good the sound is
right<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.050> basically<00:02:46.620> says<00:02:46.980> okay<00:02:47.520> well<00:02:47.730> for

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
right it basically says okay well for

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400 
right it basically says okay well for
you<00:02:48.000> do<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.360> you're<00:02:48.510> made<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.930> best<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you do what you're made to do best and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
you do what you're made to do best and
that's<00:02:49.590> produced<00:02:50.010> lows<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.670> mids<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that's produced lows or mids and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's produced lows or mids and
tweeters<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.410> what<00:02:52.560> you're<00:02:52.709> made<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.950> do

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
tweeters you do what you're made to do

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.250 
tweeters you do what you're made to do
best<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.610> produced<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> highs<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
best which is produced the highs and so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.840 
best which is produced the highs and so
it<00:02:55.620> separates<00:02:56.040> out<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> frequencies<00:02:56.730> like

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
it separates out the frequencies like

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.550 
it separates out the frequencies like
that<00:02:57.030> right<00:02:57.209> everything<00:02:57.750> working<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.140> concert

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that right everything working in concert

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
just traffic cops directing where it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
just traffic cops directing where it
