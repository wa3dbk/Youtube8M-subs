the<00:00:53.730> dairy<00:00:53.969> sustainability<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the dairy sustainability they look to

the dairy sustainability they look to
the<00:00:56.039> future<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:58.079> concern<00:00:58.620> more

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the future I think what our concern more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
the future I think what our concern more
was<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.760> were<00:00:59.910> seeing<00:01:00.180> especially<00:01:00.449> in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
was that we were seeing especially in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.609 
was that we were seeing especially in
this<00:01:01.079> area<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> decline<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> dairy<00:01:02.579> farms

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
this area a decline in the dairy farms

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.340 
this area a decline in the dairy farms
sustainability<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.070> us<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.880> more<00:01:06.479> making

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
sustainability for us is more making

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
sustainability for us is more making
sure<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.979> goes<00:01:08.280> into<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> future<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
sure that this goes into the future is a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.870 
sure that this goes into the future is a
dairy<00:01:09.750> farm<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.950> sustainability<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
dairy farm I think sustainability is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.160 
dairy farm I think sustainability is
moving<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> farm<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> next

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
moving the farm on to the next

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
moving the farm on to the next
generation<00:01:14.180> treating<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> environment

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
generation treating the environment

treating your local community right I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.399 
treating your local community right I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
think as long as we are all here working

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.500 
think as long as we are all here working
together<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.520> sustainability

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
together I think that's a sustainability

say<00:04:34.530> we<00:04:34.650> were<00:04:34.770> trendsetters<00:04:35.400> because<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.880> lot

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
say we were trendsetters because a lot

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.610 
say we were trendsetters because a lot
of<00:04:36.180> other<00:04:36.330> people<00:04:36.690> had<00:04:36.840> done<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.139> before<00:04:37.289> we

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
of other people had done it before we

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.980 
of other people had done it before we
had<00:04:37.800> done<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.849> think<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.539> found<00:04:39.780> it

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
had done it but I think we found it

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.409 
had done it but I think we found it
attractive<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.889> we<00:04:41.099> if<00:04:41.460> we<00:04:42.030> found<00:04:42.330> it

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
attractive and we if we found it

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.730 
attractive and we if we found it
attractive<00:04:42.960> we<00:04:43.050> figured<00:04:43.349> the<00:04:43.470> younger

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
attractive we figured the younger

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.589 
attractive we figured the younger
generation<00:04:44.310> find<00:04:44.550> even<00:04:44.759> more<00:04:44.849> attractive

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
generation find even more attractive

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.480 
generation find even more attractive
it's<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:46.199> about<00:04:46.440> keeping<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.949> farm<00:04:47.130> alive

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
it's just about keeping the farm alive

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.490 
it's just about keeping the farm alive
and<00:04:47.699> moving<00:04:47.910> forward<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.479> mean<00:04:49.139> if<00:04:49.229> you're<00:04:49.349> not

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
and moving forward I mean if you're not

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.529 
and moving forward I mean if you're not
moving<00:04:49.680> forward<00:04:50.010> you're<00:04:50.280> probably<00:04:50.639> not<00:04:51.389> gonna

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
moving forward you're probably not gonna

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.860 
moving forward you're probably not gonna
be<00:04:51.720> rolling<00:04:52.020> along<00:04:52.289> I<00:04:53.039> guess<00:04:53.729> we're<00:04:54.389> kind<00:04:54.419> of

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
be rolling along I guess we're kind of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.560 
be rolling along I guess we're kind of
lucky<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.440> way<00:04:55.620> because<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.970> actually<00:04:57.180> make

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
lucky in a way because we actually make

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.779 
lucky in a way because we actually make
a<00:04:57.599> better<00:04:57.870> team<00:04:58.199> together<00:04:58.440> than<00:04:59.430> we<00:04:59.610> do<00:04:59.760> a

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
a better team together than we do a

a better team together than we do a
