you<00:01:01.140> remember<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:01.680> captain<00:01:02.670> Stacy<00:01:02.850> said<00:01:03.270> he

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you remember where captain Stacy said he

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
you remember where captain Stacy said he
went<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:04.710> said<00:01:05.010> he<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
went out of it and he said he will and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.649 
went out of it and he said he will and
then<00:01:05.489> by<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> end<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> movie<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.600> all

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
then by the end of the movie for all

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.399 
then by the end of the movie for all
that<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> promise

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that I promise

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
that I promise
so<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.549> imagine<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.000> P<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.479> be

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so we imagine that P is gonna be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.490 
so we imagine that P is gonna be
hallucinating<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:12.049> don't<00:01:13.049> know

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
hallucinating and I don't know

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
hallucinating and I don't know
running<00:01:14.040> off<00:01:14.159> during<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> graduation<00:01:14.760> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
running off during the graduation I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.130 
running off during the graduation I
suppose<00:01:16.070> anyway<00:01:17.119> in<00:01:18.119> these<00:01:18.360> pictures<00:01:18.630> people

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
suppose anyway in these pictures people

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
suppose anyway in these pictures people
speculate<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> Flash<00:01:20.070> Thompson<00:01:20.280> will<00:01:20.670> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
speculate that Flash Thompson will be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.190 
speculate that Flash Thompson will be
returning<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> amazing<00:01:21.810> spider-man<00:01:21.869> 2

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
returning in the amazing spider-man 2

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.550 
returning in the amazing spider-man 2
and<00:01:23.240> maybe<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.630> boom<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> maybe<00:01:25.380> them

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and maybe the right boom and maybe them

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
and maybe the right boom and maybe them
not<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.860> obviously<00:01:26.430> he's<00:01:26.790> probably<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
not so obviously he's probably going to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
not so obviously he's probably going to
be<00:01:27.750> returning<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> meze<00:01:28.500> sponsor<00:01:28.860> otherwise

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
be returning the meze sponsor otherwise

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
be returning the meze sponsor otherwise
he<00:01:29.250> won't<00:01:29.340> even<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.900> think

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
he won't even be there but I don't think

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
he won't even be there but I don't think
this<00:01:31.170> picture<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> set<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this picture is on the set I think this

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
this picture is on the set I think this
is<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.850> standard<00:01:33.119> Garfield<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> play

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
some basketball with it and maybe Flash

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
some basketball with it and maybe Flash
Thompson<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> movie<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> tattoos

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
