00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.150
 a violin succumbing 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.270
 they feel 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 for Susanne Gelhard the character of a violin has to be in the hands 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.629
 be felt 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.490
 if I have a violin farmer and I actually always try 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.009
 m will be good to build of course 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.749
 then I do not really think about the musicians yet 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.429
 Steiner 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.480
 that would distract me too much from the essential i knew i must mine 

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:30.479
 have ideal in mind and that I model first 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.850
 Minute finally sound 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.770
 a former hunting lodge of the Hohenzollern 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.250
 which has been the violin maker race for nine years, their workshop 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.780
 7 to 8 homemade ten years 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.650
 at prices from about 8000 euros 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.490
 her biggest success so far German wines international violin makers 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.150
 Competition in Mittenwald ounces of silver for the best sound and the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.560
 best workmanship 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.510
 a childhood dream 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.540
 at 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.470
 learned to play the violin at the age of ten 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.320
 Company in turn has gone a farmer 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.070
 "There's more to it 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.260
 liked it so much 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 quite peaceful atmosphere there smelled the cut 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.570
 quietly classical music played in the background 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.460
 that has touched me so much as a child that that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.469
 wanted to do 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.570
 the job 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 we should actually look "I had no idea about that" 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 the most important element in the same profession is the wood 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 Dude, I think they are working 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.550
 it all determines the sound of the instrument 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 Susanne GÃ¤rtner favors spruce and Aron Ralston 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.270
 with a planer you bring the wood in the right shape 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 every little vault changes the sound 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 that is what determines the uniqueness of a violin 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.440
 the goods are the fiddles the caution 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.040
 a plaster cast is always nearby 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.530
 On the one hand, there are totally perfect man constructions in harmony and for one thing 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.660
 other 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.100
 also artisanal 4 but you still see traces of work despite the lead 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.699
 it is not 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.869
 No odds of relationships is that is incredible 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.069
 because lies 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.390
 the Mr the market is like the handwriting of a violin maker if only for yourself 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.159
 Mixed earlier, the violins dried in the sun today takes over 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 Traumeinstand this task 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.579
 like a ready-made violin sounds firm promise applies best together 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 not to be exaggerated with the soloist Julia 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.089
 Natural current deep 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.169
 maybe understand a fantastic speeches 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.789
 even in the heights CP years she is taking 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.009
 it makes great pleasure 80 g 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.670
 It takes about 200 hours of work 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.430
 then she's done the violin with her own character
