00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:05.850
 the music fair of the gross Lucy 2 TV present the benefit of the tube 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.740
 canceled 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.929
 we are 2010 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.039
 Hello and welcome to me so to speak today it is about percent of 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.689
 Shares the strongest climbs going on the right 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.870
 Telefonica 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 yes but to achieve the legacy EBITDA and who has the first blow out 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.960
 very good Red Normal form Horner we just keep going here will not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.869
 year so it's live so to speak, a record is a few 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 Goalkeeper himself in the thread is he will be there exactly 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.680
 around 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 I definitely wanted to come here again at the booth 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 Because it is very enthusiastic if synonymous of the BFD 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.960
 At the moment, everything is still running on one computer 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 10 4 11 I'm just and unfortunately 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 there is also 10 with 10 to 4 percent 9 is Arnesen that one has at the bottom 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 the hard stronger faster computer the Wegner except for nem next 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.890
 Calculator as synonymous with newer but soon will be my main computer 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.230
 around the Wiler Bergholz Cusley viewers outside the East makes the FDP that is 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.830
 the break 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.070
 Although Wittlich has to say it 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.930
 there is the trained Aarau and that is just stupid percent BF Dr 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.140
 To get away most movie is just awesome is streaming 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 in order to somehow quasi I believe are twelve microphone channels the DAlzG was see 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 a be from the hard disk of the movie 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 and it sounds like a lot 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.609
 real drums came but also electronic sounds 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.599
 Braun that one can mean everything but what has that is just super think it 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.660
 simply Sosna 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.390
 Percent, it is actually already integrated mixing console Dukas Dynamics 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.890
 Wenders eKiosk if you have just Feet 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.970
 Percent I say a little stupid 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.440
 Separate machines in the sound dyeing and so complete more runs Einstein 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.270
 Transfer and make with BFD 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.030
 provided that the powerful 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 AR calculator but you have to spend so easy nowadays it will be yes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450
 but always build quotes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 Tfr got this kicker chose a kind of rehearsal tree pulls out ending 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.959
 Transferbörse Clock a lot of CDU so Leopard Server is not that many 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.700
 the CDU stops only when the mixer is activated 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.650
 Under the make-up channel you can invite more to the effects 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.230
 and if the man had full against Nico Channel then with four effects all the way 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.990
 Of course, go to the CDU but main problem with DFB with smaller 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.379
 Computers or weaker computers, it just keeps it very directly from the disk 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.220
 Scenes and you need a fast record and you use as percent the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.129
 Hardware the time 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.499
 Details but but so far only one will beat a bit older 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:42.960
 can 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.480
 and then the rest comes directly from the plate of Sun Sun's opponent 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.980
 Beitz full Stampa »Monster he is 2 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.549
 Account Standard Library with 55's work on Saturday 5 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.969
 and there is still something bill usb-hard drive equal to or not 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.669
 that did not have helpers 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.829
 I would prefer internal 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.359
 to use the area Artur plate 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.609
 so that's it so it's really like that Sam 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.639
 I mean that he does not just do drums on a computer, but what 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.709
 maybe a few more cars then 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.309
 that a few other virtual instruments and so on and that 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.309
 I said that you really do not need it 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.299
 Control more complex Brinkmann also pays to inherit with BFD 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.449
 and others 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.449
 Drug Renault around which the calculator must calculate 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.199
 Percent to create 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.150
 you definitely need scope Ackeren calculator 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.120
 yes I did not try my darling somehow on expiring expired crate 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.970
 because more has been said i need to get out on a machine anyway 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.740
 keeping it somehow contemporary is a question about love trouble to blender 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.250
 Viennese Dudler then probably should not actually use it in the end 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.480
 so for layout trip by any case with 5 5% both-as-well so I have 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.489
 even the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.619
 the application had that's just around 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.929
 the combinations 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:04.869
 so to say 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.140
 our life trams so well played trams 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.450
 with BFD and Colette without throwing as there is also the Coro 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.319
 mixed 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.090
 around which I as very loosened him up with Beatbox story as 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.349
 and around 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.860
 yes and Pepe why should we because now we will almost clear up there again 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.400
 May in Amman 1 I would understand that now 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.999
 because the Essen band 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.300
 yes, and then it starts to have a bit reprehensible to say 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.240
 we're going to make one sitting there, everything just looks like something out of the machine or something 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.879
 Especially if you are such a good goalkeeper 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.550
 could mean that he then a sin Walter Sittler even 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.240
 not so many good kickers Dr 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.650
 around ISM 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
 I can not say much more about that, but I realize what he is saying and 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.450
 although if you are now programming our partners 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.430
 is that then 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.280
 Hitzinger possibilities in that she counts in there the Gdansk 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.610
 Accessories make or sixth in the year so both-and-so sometimes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.050
 inspired simply colos-hall that then almost ever with the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.409
 with the sound aesthetics and in q4 poor holders percent 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.220
 around 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.300
 that already Mr. Tanz are prepared you can switch then also over Midi 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.340
 triggered 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.050
 and I like to use the function I like to come here 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.790
 Okay on the keyboard so if not as a keyboardist Altmain 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.069
 about MTU Ex makes 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.240
 and I, of course, have also gained a bit of experience 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.139
 with the tram and knows how the work or here it should 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.300
 It is also very fresh 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.159
 i mean no format four feet for example so i can hold on 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.249
 is somehow duplicate and again somebody 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.469
 operating two highlights or so at the same time is clearly what you need to know 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.960
 But then it does not matter in such a context 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.770
 if it works in production if the tracklist title is then 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.659
 make it stop 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.360
 Gerbrunn one must have, if necessary, either the decision cases the game 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.699
 Jörg Berres in the summer does not play his own attitude the other 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.839
 or you have to stop if necessary then on the stage 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.269
 Namely, all of Jacky agree to program something that we like 

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:07.439
 authentic sounds 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.589
 if he has concerns about so yes only two hands of the affected person he means 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.899
 only certain things make rapstar maybe something to do but on 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:18.219
 In any case, I already have names after this center is on board 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.210
 discovered 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.999
 that's about a percent 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.759
 Biathlon with Les Mains but that also works 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.610
 percentages around neck and drum place menthol 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.770
 and we tried it out because it's on YouTube 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.180
 in a video on video just tried it out 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.080
 Percent with percent conversions 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.180
 Cut percent 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.409
 Percent hit 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.490
 cooking pots 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.490
 kiss Tiffert MacRae he plays creatively 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.460
 yes, with saucepans 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.840
 Unna and the quasi triggered yes and I mean that's really incredible 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.539
 what then in the percussionist halt or sit he has on the 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.860
 Treble Rumble is drumming and then you almost hear on the other side of the 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.860
 Slice in the studio old moose test were super 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.180
 and that it stops as my are so many beautiful in the task bar now that it 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.090
 extreme 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.600
 inspirational super 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.820
 good conclusion I have another question the 11 already all over 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.990
 spoken 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.089
 What kind of a course is the name 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.150
 that comes 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.529
 the 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.669
 some war comes from way 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.669
 Eleven you can think what you want and otherwise 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.259
 only the beer is far worse now that it is her 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.680
 that's the biggest quail 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.920
 the by Glauberg at Koi force the octopus or doors 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:39.439
 by Christoph b Oregon the players again packet age actually so 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:44.039
 you know target group of something like that, therefore, like to stay defeated again Sempra 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.759
 he rejoined in a game in Battlefield 2 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:52.539
 So Dr Altdorf Todd Elik Age and her parents will answer 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:56.939
 No he answer and answer so it would have to be further on 

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:58.599
 Bolatti leads 

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.969
 that you did this here for us but purchase 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:02.009
 JAL like
