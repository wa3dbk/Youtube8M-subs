400 for any combination your life yeah
I've<00:00:47.379> got<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.590> swivel<00:00:48.070> here<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:49.570> I'm

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
I've got a swivel here because I'm

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.420 
I've got a swivel here because I'm
running<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.170> sinker<00:00:51.239> directly<00:00:53.159> down<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
running the sinker directly down to the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.640 
running the sinker directly down to the
hook<00:00:54.640> as<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.449> can<00:00:55.570> see<00:00:55.809> or<00:00:55.989> on<00:00:56.170> top<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.559> the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
hook as you can see or on top of the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.860 
hook as you can see or on top of the
swivel<00:00:57.040> so<00:00:57.879> that's<00:00:58.089> what's<00:00:58.570> going<00:00:58.780> to

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
swivel so that's what's going to

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.259 
swivel so that's what's going to
eliminate<00:00:59.650> any<00:00:59.860> line<00:01:00.129> twists<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.760> actually

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
eliminate any line twists and actually

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.990 
eliminate any line twists and actually
using<00:01:02.140> an<00:01:02.229> overhead<00:01:02.680> stayed<00:01:03.489> out<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.760> least

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
using an overhead stayed out the least

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.670 
using an overhead stayed out the least
amount<00:01:04.300> of<00:01:04.449> law<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:04.780> twist<00:01:05.050> of<00:01:05.199> any<00:01:05.379> rule

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
amount of law and twist of any rule

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.130 
amount of law and twist of any rule
probably<00:01:06.610> down<00:01:06.880> here<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.210> traceur<00:01:07.630> get<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
probably down here on traceur get is the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.450 
probably down here on traceur get is the
Bates<00:01:08.409> movement<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.100> water

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
Bates movement in the water

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.330 
Bates movement in the water
retrieving<00:01:10.300> it<00:01:10.530> hopefully<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:11.770> won't<00:01:12.010> bring<00:01:12.280> it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
retrieving it hopefully I won't bring it

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.120 
retrieving it hopefully I won't bring it
