00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.460 
fog now in colder temperatures fog can
become<00:00:50.580> a<00:00:50.610> real<00:00:51.030> issue<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> safety

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
become a real issue and it's a safety

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.170 
become a real issue and it's a safety

this<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:03.330> pin<00:02:03.479> lock<00:02:03.660> insert<00:02:03.989> itself<00:02:04.340> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this is the pin lock insert itself it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.650 
this is the pin lock insert itself it
might<00:02:05.520> look<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.940> yellow<00:02:06.209> to<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
might look kind of yellow to you and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.820 
might look kind of yellow to you and
that's<00:02:06.720> because<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.349> actually<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.800> a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
that's because it actually has a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.010 
that's because it actually has a
protective<00:02:08.369> coating<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
protective coating on it the thing to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.610 
protective coating on it the thing to
note<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.880> small<00:02:12.510> bead<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
note on here is you have a small bead of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
note on here is you have a small bead of
silicone<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.430> runs<00:02:14.880> all<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> way<00:02:15.599> around

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
silicone that runs all the way around

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.670 
silicone that runs all the way around
the<00:02:16.110> edge

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the edge

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.369 
the edge
of<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> pinlock<00:02:17.219> insert<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:17.909> is<00:02:18.689> really

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
of the pinlock insert and that is really

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.289 
of the pinlock insert and that is really
thin<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.890> you'll<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.269> of

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
thin and you'll have to just kind of

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.699 
thin and you'll have to just kind of
feel<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.599> with<00:02:21.689> your<00:02:21.810> fingers<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:22.409> sure

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
feel it with your fingers and make sure

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.949 
feel it with your fingers and make sure
that<00:02:23.219> that<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.150> side<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.599> actually

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
that that is the side that is actually

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
that that is the side that is actually
going<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.290> against<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.920> shield<00:02:26.159> when<00:02:26.430> you

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
going to go against the shield when you

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.270 
going to go against the shield when you
install<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:28.879> once<00:02:29.879> you've<00:02:30.000> got<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> insert

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
install it once you've got the insert

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
install it once you've got the insert
out<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.670> go<00:02:32.879> ahead<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.180> remove<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.450> face

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.000 
out you go ahead and remove your face
shield<00:02:34.019> off<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.349> your<00:02:34.469> helmet<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.709> obviously

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
shield off of your helmet so obviously

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.110 
shield off of your helmet so obviously
different<00:02:38.280> comments<00:02:38.579> have<00:02:38.760> different

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
different comments have different

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.910 
different comments have different
methods<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.510> doing<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.469> easiest

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
methods of doing that and the easiest

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.069 
methods of doing that and the easiest
way<00:02:41.219> that<00:02:41.250> I've<00:02:41.639> found<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:42.150> install<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:42.900> pin

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
way that I've found to install the pin

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.589 
way that I've found to install the pin
lock<00:02:43.260> insert<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.310> actually<00:02:44.790> lay<00:02:45.329> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
lock insert is to actually lay the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.410 
lock insert is to actually lay the
shield<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.170> its<00:02:46.709> face<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:48.000> spread<00:02:48.389> it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
shield on its face and kind of spread it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.330 
shield on its face and kind of spread it
out<00:02:48.599> flat<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.409> kind<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.680> bend<00:02:49.919> your<00:02:50.159> face

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
out flat you can kind of bend your face

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.670 
out flat you can kind of bend your face
shield<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.900> install<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.049> between<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> posts

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
shield and install it between the posts

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.599 
shield and install it between the posts
another<00:02:53.609> thing<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.939> point<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:55.579> there<00:02:56.579> are

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
another thing to point out is there are

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.789 
another thing to point out is there are
actually<00:02:57.269> two<00:02:57.510> positions<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.439> posts

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
actually two positions for the posts

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.319 
actually two positions for the posts
you'll<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.069> there's<00:02:59.250> an<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.639> slot<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> V

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
you'll see there's an a slot and a V

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.420 
you'll see there's an a slot and a V
slot<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:00.840> that's<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.919> adjust

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
slot and that's just so you can adjust

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.300 
slot and that's just so you can adjust
the<00:03:02.719> positioning<00:03:03.719> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.049> pinlock<00:03:04.379> insert<00:03:04.889> up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the positioning of the pinlock insert up

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.729 
the positioning of the pinlock insert up
or<00:03:05.579> down<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.510> shield<00:03:06.719> itself<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:07.590> you've

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
or down on the shield itself so you've

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.550 
or down on the shield itself so you've
got<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.010> shield<00:03:08.219> if<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.389> want<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.659> insert<00:03:10.049> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
got the shield if you want the insert to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.039 
got the shield if you want the insert to
reside<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.280> little<00:03:11.760> bit<00:03:11.879> higher<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.840> face

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
reside a little bit higher on the face

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.720 
reside a little bit higher on the face
shield<00:03:13.290> you'll<00:03:13.769> obviously<00:03:13.889> install<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.579> on

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
shield you'll obviously install it on

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.449 
shield you'll obviously install it on
the<00:03:14.849> lower<00:03:15.030> pin<00:03:15.719> holes<00:03:16.469> on<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:17.040> side<00:03:17.219> of<00:03:17.400> the

the lower pin holes on the side of the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.580 
the lower pin holes on the side of the
pin<00:03:17.609> lock<00:03:17.760> insert<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.329> that's<00:03:18.900> usually<00:03:19.139> done

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
pin lock insert and that's usually done

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.830 
pin lock insert and that's usually done
for<00:03:19.829> more<00:03:20.340> sporty<00:03:20.879> applications<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.720> you're

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

got this gasket that runs across the top
that's<00:03:39.359> what<00:03:39.599> actually<00:03:39.900> seals<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.769> against

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
that's what actually seals up against

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610 
that's what actually seals up against
the<00:03:41.400> face<00:03:41.579> shield<00:03:41.989> make<00:03:42.989> sure<00:03:43.139> that<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.439> is

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the face shield make sure that this is

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.289 
the face shield make sure that this is
going<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:43.949> enough<00:03:44.159> clearance<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.150> it

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
going to have enough clearance and if it

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.449 
going to have enough clearance and if it
does<00:03:45.509> hit<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.169> want<00:03:46.379> to<00:03:46.590> switch<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.310> out<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
does hit you want to switch it out and

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.149 
does hit you want to switch it out and
make<00:03:47.699> sure<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.349> doesn't<00:03:49.349> hit<00:03:50.099> that

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
make sure that it doesn't hit that

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.339 
make sure that it doesn't hit that
because<00:03:50.609> that<00:03:50.790> could<00:03:50.939> damage<00:03:51.150> your<00:03:51.720> gasket<00:03:52.259> on

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
because that could damage your gasket on

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.110 
because that could damage your gasket on
your<00:03:52.470> helmet<00:03:52.799> or<00:03:53.129> scratch<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.759> inside<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
your helmet or scratch the inside of

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.599 
your helmet or scratch the inside of
your<00:03:54.209> shield<00:03:54.449> or<00:03:54.829> just<00:03:55.829> mess<00:03:55.979> up<00:03:56.009> the<00:03:56.280> pin<00:03:56.459> lock

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
your shield or just mess up the pin lock

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.360 
your shield or just mess up the pin lock
so<00:03:57.479> to<00:03:57.540> install<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.199> very<00:03:58.379> simple<00:03:58.829> you'll

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so to install it is very simple you'll

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.979 
so to install it is very simple you'll
just<00:03:59.519> want<00:03:59.699> to<00:03:59.759> orient<00:03:59.909> it<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.569> straight

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
just want to orient it so the straight

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.929 
just want to orient it so the straight
edge<00:04:01.139> is<00:04:01.379> across<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.889> top<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.370> then<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
edge is across the top and then the

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.289 
edge is across the top and then the
curved<00:04:03.180> edge<00:04:03.419> goes<00:04:03.689> around<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.079> bottom<00:04:05.299> and

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
curved edge goes around the bottom and

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.520 
curved edge goes around the bottom and
we're<00:04:06.419> going<00:04:06.449> to<00:04:06.599> go<00:04:06.720> ahead<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.229> what<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
we're going to go ahead and what I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.300 
we're going to go ahead and what I
usually<00:04:07.799> do<00:04:08.159> is<00:04:08.519> insert<00:04:09.509> one<00:04:09.930> side<00:04:10.280> into<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
usually do is insert one side into the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.189 
usually do is insert one side into the
pin<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:12.150> you're<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.329> going<00:04:12.479> to<00:04:12.569> slide<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.049> in

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
pin so you're just going to slide it in

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.530 
pin so you're just going to slide it in
it's<00:04:13.470> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.739> slide<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.790> onto<00:04:15.449> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it's going to slide right in onto the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.770 
it's going to slide right in onto the
post<00:04:15.750> there<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.459> then<00:04:17.459> what<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.699> can<00:04:17.729> do<00:04:18.000> is

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
post there and then what you can do is

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.060 
post there and then what you can do is
kind<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.049> get<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.289> into<00:04:19.500> place<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.979> then

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
kind of get it into place and then

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.529 
kind of get it into place and then
you're<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.430> going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.639> kind<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.909> help<00:04:21.030> spread

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
you're just going to kind of help spread

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.320 
you're just going to kind of help spread
that<00:04:21.750> shield<00:04:22.079> flat

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that shield flat

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
that shield flat
it<00:04:24.509> clicked<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.169> it'll<00:04:25.830> kind<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.069> push

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it clicked in and it'll kind of push

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.839 
it clicked in and it'll kind of push
itself<00:04:26.699> down<00:04:27.060> onto<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.810> shield<00:04:28.050> by<00:04:28.319> itself

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
itself down onto the shield by itself

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.610 
itself down onto the shield by itself
kind<00:04:29.849> of<00:04:30.000> naturally<00:04:30.449> wants<00:04:30.689> to<00:04:30.840> push<00:04:31.259> against

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
kind of naturally wants to push against

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.950 
kind of naturally wants to push against
the<00:04:31.710> shield<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.189> that's<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:33.360> installed

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the shield so that's the installed

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.990 
the shield so that's the installed
pinlock<00:04:34.530> shield<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.099> then<00:04:35.250> obviously<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.789> has

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
pinlock shield and then obviously it has

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.439 
pinlock shield and then obviously it has
a<00:04:36.270> protective<00:04:37.080> coating<00:04:37.439> on<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:38.340> as<00:04:38.460> well<00:04:38.639> we

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
a protective coating on it as well we

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.290 
a protective coating on it as well we
can<00:04:39.599> just<00:04:39.629> pull<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.020> off<00:04:43.219> and<00:04:44.219> you'll<00:04:45.150> see

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
can just pull that off and you'll see

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.409 
can just pull that off and you'll see
it's<00:04:45.449> completely<00:04:45.930> clear<00:04:46.939> so<00:04:47.939> we'll<00:04:48.090> take<00:04:48.240> this

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
it's completely clear so we'll take this

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.050 
it's completely clear so we'll take this
outside<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:48.870> demonstrate<00:04:49.500> how<00:04:49.949> it<00:04:50.069> works<00:04:50.129> so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
outside and demonstrate how it works so

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.850 
outside and demonstrate how it works so
you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.449> how<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.900> actually<00:04:52.080> prevents

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you can see how it actually prevents

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.950 
you can see how it actually prevents
fogging<00:04:53.159> but<00:04:53.460> essentially<00:04:54.000> what<00:04:54.449> it's<00:04:54.599> doing

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
fogging but essentially what it's doing

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.589 
fogging but essentially what it's doing
is<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.560> creates<00:04:56.219> a<00:04:56.340> small<00:04:56.550> bead<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.180> air<00:04:57.389> in

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
is it creates a small bead of air in

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.450 
is it creates a small bead of air in
between<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.229> pin<00:04:58.409> lock<00:04:58.590> lens<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.129> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
between the pin lock lens and the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.820 
between the pin lock lens and the
outside<00:04:59.879> of<00:05:00.150> your<00:05:00.360> face<00:05:00.599> shield<00:05:00.900> that's<00:05:01.560> going

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
outside of your face shield that's going

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.770 
outside of your face shield that's going
to<00:05:01.889> insulate<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.909> inner<00:05:03.120> shield<00:05:03.479> from<00:05:03.719> the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
to insulate the inner shield from the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.869 
to insulate the inner shield from the
outer<00:05:04.050> shield<00:05:04.409> so<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.069> doesn't<00:05:05.370> fog<00:05:05.639> up

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
outer shield so that it doesn't fog up

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.760 
outer shield so that it doesn't fog up
and<00:05:06.090> then<00:05:06.479> it's<00:05:06.629> also<00:05:06.810> made<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.319> a<00:05:07.469> thicker

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and then it's also made of a thicker

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.129 
and then it's also made of a thicker
porous<00:05:08.580> plastic<00:05:09.479> material<00:05:09.930> which<00:05:09.960> is

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
porous plastic material which is

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.529 
porous plastic material which is
actually<00:05:10.530> moisture<00:05:10.979> absorbing<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.909> anything

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
actually moisture absorbing so anything

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.240 
actually moisture absorbing so anything
that<00:05:12.690> does<00:05:12.930> want<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.169> condense<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.919> inside

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
that does want to condense on the inside

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.610 
that does want to condense on the inside
is<00:05:14.430> actually<00:05:14.580> absorbed<00:05:15.449> into<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.319> pinlock

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
is actually absorbed into the pinlock

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.260 
is actually absorbed into the pinlock
