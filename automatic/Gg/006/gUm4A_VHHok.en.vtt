00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello cgg and dougie today we're going 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 introduce yourself to a little presentation 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 quick of the new dg 580 good to see 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.690
 a little bit all the functions and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.690
 why this dg 580 is super cool 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.440
 so this DG 580 kiss me that carries well 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.340
 his name 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.440
 it's true that we want to make 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.540
 kisses he is firstly he is handsome 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.280
 it is true that there we can we can 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.260
 to say he is handsome he has a beautiful design 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.400
 it is true that he is quite trendy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.530
 looks a little bit like phones 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.730
 who are on other brands but that's 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.110
 a little bit the fashion the design of this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.590
 moment and it's true it's rather 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.330
 group 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 then he is sexy with his little dress 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.760
 there with her little white dress 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.220
 see we have a contour in finishing a little 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.559
 glossy finish aluminum color which 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.260
 is rather pretty he has a beautiful dress 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.960
 he has a beautiful finish very very beautiful 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 very very pretty then what is it 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 can say he's fine he's even very 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.060
 very thin with five points 5 mm 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.060
 thick 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.290
 it'll be pretty late and it is 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.770
 it's true that it gives him a game 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.360
 who behind 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.220
 second reason why he is pretty 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
 because it has a very nice screen actually 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 it has a 5.5 inch screen and on the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.450
 diagonal and it's a qhd screen so in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 did it go below the hd but 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.690
 it's not bad it's 960 by 540 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.040
 allows you to have a better 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.990
 battery life because then 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.789
 to pixel lit plus it consumes on the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 battery then he has a technology at 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.619
 gs so technologies is a screen that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 is a technology with a window 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.130
 very very fine which allows a small 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.990
 little reduce the thickness and of course 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 the phone it is ip it wants it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 to say you have a viewing angle of 180 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.759
 third degree reason why this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 phone it is super cool 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.619
 well it runs on android 4.4.2 so 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.490
 the latest version of android version 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.530
 4.4 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.880
 he always said it's the kit kat 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.979
 that of the version you will have all 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360
 the slabs in function and there are few 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.069
 phones that are 4.15 except the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.069
 last and of course those who set themselves 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.149
 and his android 2.4 fourth point 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.009
 positive of this phone 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.810
 it's double sim it's pretty good 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 you have by m 2 6 mhz a sim 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.530
 classic like that a micro sim 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.209
 here this is fine for example if you 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 have one professionally and one 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.690
 personally you will be able after 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.220
 alternating one or the other there will be a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.920
 of the two teams who will be 3g the second 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.050
 who will be that gsm you could see here 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.280
 you will not add a microsd slot 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.020
 fifth point 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.530
 actually the processor this impression 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.870
 mt 192 it's a quad core 1 4 x 1 giga 3 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.660
 and a quad core 4 end Thursday at three that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.140
 is largely sufficient for use in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.819
 daily 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.780
 sixth positive point when 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.189
 to make you see today because there 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's a version it's a prototype in 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.670
 does you actually have the gesture that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.049
 allows you with functions of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.519
 drawings to start the device by 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.290
 example by putting here you go 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.760
 able to read your messages by doing 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.620
 so you can start it 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.269
 by doing so you will be able to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.829
 listen to music and doing 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.790
 like that you will be able to directly 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.189
 put it in video mode 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.870
 all that smells like they 're the button that 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.480
 it is rather practical seventh point 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.889
 why do not you want to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 kisses in fact it's his camera 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.109
 back that is 8 me in pixels that's 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.569
 not bad and then she has an angle of 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.609
 80 ° 80 ° ckoi and quite simply on 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.049
 the image you will see more like we 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.980
 see a little bit on the sport camera if 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.719
 it is only there you will not have the effect 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.280
 fisheye it's a little bit rounded you 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.650
 will really have a picture that will be a bit 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.730
 wider and 80 degrees little of 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.639
 phones have a camera like his 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.280
 eighth point this phone is doogie dg 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.449
 581 kiss me he is sensitive 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.549
 that means that we had just received a 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.859
 call if you shake him twice he goes 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.120
 pick up or for example if you receive 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.099
 a call if you put directly to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.199
 the ear thanks to its sensors like it 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.090
 will automatically pick up and function 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.079
 which is quite useful for example you 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.609
 programmed it means that when you 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.290
 will be in meeting building where to lay the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.729
 phone like that on the table 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.310
 automatically it will go into 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.810
 silent ninth point to pack 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.659
 due kisses and many simply 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.639
 because he has everything he has the gps and sensor 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.680
 tg water it has the direct wi fi it's 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.060
 bluetooth 4.0 a low energy bluetooth 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.479
 that will work with watches and 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.299
 bracelets 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:57.509
 he has hashed the islands on the radio and 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.220
 finally he has a battery of 2500 mignan 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.829
 loses so the geek is in think this 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.049
 phone there is not the sexiest 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.909
 So it tells you more very soon we 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.019
 you will do a full test of the device 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.759
 with all the functions will you 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.259
 explain everything how it works 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.549
 in the meantime you can subscribe to 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.280
 because remember you too 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280
 subscribe not more expensive 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.000
