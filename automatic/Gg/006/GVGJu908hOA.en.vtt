second<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> ET<00:01:13.049> classes<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.740> mean<00:01:14.009> that's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
second to ET classes I mean that's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
second to ET classes I mean that's
really<00:01:14.490> impressive<00:01:14.939> numbers<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
really impressive numbers from this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
really impressive numbers from this
which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.710> stock<00:01:17.040> Mustang

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
which is pretty much a stock Mustang

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.569 
which is pretty much a stock Mustang
yes<00:01:18.210> yep<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:19.290> fact<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> catalysts

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
yes yep in fact it's got the catalysts

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.700 
yes yep in fact it's got the catalysts
on<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.390> has<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.810> aftermarket<00:01:22.259> exhaust

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
on it and it has an aftermarket exhaust

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.960 
on it and it has an aftermarket exhaust
system<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.460> running<00:01:23.640> through<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
system so it's running through the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
system so it's running through the
mufflers<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.440> us<00:01:25.500> complete<00:01:25.950> emissions

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
mufflers so all of us complete emissions

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
mufflers so all of us complete emissions
equipment<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.000> intact<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.960> pretty

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
equipment is intact and it's pretty

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
equipment is intact and it's pretty
reliable<00:01:28.500> too<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.830> were<00:01:28.920> saying

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
reliable too because you were saying

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
reliable too because you were saying
earlier<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> you've<00:01:29.730> done<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.120> hundred

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
earlier that you've done like a hundred

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
earlier that you've done like a hundred
passes<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.260> not<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.860> had<00:01:31.950> any<00:01:32.159> problems

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
passes and not really had any problems

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.810 
passes and not really had any problems
at<00:01:32.580> all
