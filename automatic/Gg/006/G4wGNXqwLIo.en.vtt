00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
to training and what I have to do in the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.570 
to training and what I have to do in the
times<00:03:23.200> when<00:03:23.440> I'm<00:03:23.530> not<00:03:23.709> training<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.220> order<00:03:24.430> to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
times when I'm not training in order to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.510 
times when I'm not training in order to
be<00:03:24.700> able<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:26.440> changed<00:03:26.980> it's

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
be able to do that so it's changed it's

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.580 
be able to do that so it's changed it's
just<00:03:27.790> evolved<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.510> think<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.989> little<00:03:29.140> bit<00:03:29.320> when

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
just evolved I think a little bit when

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.050 
just evolved I think a little bit when
you're<00:03:29.739> getting<00:03:29.980> older<00:03:30.220> with<00:03:30.370> your<00:03:30.550> career

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
you're getting older with your career

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.710 
you're getting older with your career
you<00:03:31.420> know<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.620> becomes<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:34.030> about<00:03:34.330> what

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
you know it it becomes more about what

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.840 
you know it it becomes more about what
you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.930> give<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.530> team<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.010> less<00:03:36.610> about

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
you can give to the team and less about

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.720 
you can give to the team and less about
what<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.209> team<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.900> for<00:03:37.930> you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
know their own the big problem is that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.720 
know their own the big problem is that
we<00:04:16.030> don't<00:04:16.060> have<00:04:16.330> many<00:04:16.540> attackers<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.830> the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
we don't have many attackers in the

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.580 
we don't have many attackers in the
squad<00:04:19.000> but<00:04:19.299> except<00:04:19.840> for<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.109> was<00:04:20.380> think

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
squad but except for that I was think

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.950 
squad but except for that I was think
that<00:04:20.769> equality<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.280> ok<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:22.060> think<00:04:22.450> that's<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that equality is ok I think that's the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.010 
that equality is ok I think that's the
focus<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.680> try<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.919> get<00:04:24.220> everybody

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
time a little bit so there are many

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.290 
time a little bit so there are many
things<00:05:38.080> in<00:05:38.259> each<00:05:38.830> game<00:05:39.159> coming<00:05:39.610> up<00:05:39.699> that<00:05:40.030> we

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
things in each game coming up that we

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.809

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
think would do pretty well but we might

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.040 
think would do pretty well but we might
change<00:05:45.219> the<00:05:45.400> formation<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.090> little<00:05:46.330> bit<00:05:46.449> and<00:05:46.659> be

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
change the formation a little bit and be

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.459 
change the formation a little bit and be
able<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.289> play<00:05:47.529> in<00:05:47.860> different<00:05:48.340> systems<00:05:48.969> so

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469
