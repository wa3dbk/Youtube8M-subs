which you know I think was a fairly

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.540 
which you know I think was a fairly
thick<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.620> was<00:02:29.680> pretty<00:02:29.860> shocking<00:02:30.190> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
thick it was pretty shocking and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.220 
thick it was pretty shocking and
overwhelming<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.239> him<00:02:31.360> at<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:31.930> that

overwhelming to him at first like that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.770 
overwhelming to him at first like that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
like they're nice guys and this was a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
like they're nice guys and this was a
big<00:02:57.489> team<00:02:57.670> effort<00:02:57.819> it's<00:02:58.690> really<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> two

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
big team effort it's really just the two

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.509 
big team effort it's really just the two
of<00:02:59.410> them<00:02:59.680> tell<00:02:59.950> anyone<00:03:00.190> else<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> go

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
of them tell anyone else to go

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.000 
of them tell anyone else to go
themselves<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:02.110> whole<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:05.010> obviously

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
themselves the whole time so obviously

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.080 
themselves the whole time so obviously
I'm<00:03:06.160> kidding<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:06.640> um<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.980> that's<00:03:09.820> where<00:03:10.060> I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
I'm kidding but um but so that's where I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.030 
I'm kidding but um but so that's where I
mean<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.600> where<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.170> started<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.829> should

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
mean that's where this started I should

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.380 
mean that's where this started I should
back<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.670> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.060> really

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
back up a little bit to it really

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.690 
back up a little bit to it really
started<00:03:13.720> with<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.200> guess<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.739> Boyd<00:03:15.280> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
started with I guess you know Boyd and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.449 
started with I guess you know Boyd and
myself<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.620> want<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.010> do<00:03:18.100> some<00:03:18.340> in

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
myself really want to do some in

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.060 
myself really want to do some in
Charlottesville<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.299> Boyd<00:03:20.260> really<00:03:20.530> followed

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
Charlottesville and Boyd really followed

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.949 
Charlottesville and Boyd really followed
throwing<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.700> do<00:03:21.760> think<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.329> had<00:03:22.600> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
throwing that and I do think it had a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.979 
throwing that and I do think it had a
lot<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:24.010> do<00:03:24.160> with<00:03:24.190> Boyd<00:03:25.120> needing<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.690> release

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
lot to do with Boyd needing a release

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.470 
lot to do with Boyd needing a release
and<00:03:26.019> myself<00:03:26.739> as<00:03:26.980> as<00:03:27.250> well<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:28.000> was<00:03:28.120> something

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
and myself as as well it was something

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.500 
and myself as as well it was something
to<00:03:28.630> do<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.190> keep<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.370> touch<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
to do and keep in touch more and have a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.759 
to do and keep in touch more and have a
project<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.079> we<00:03:32.230> were<00:03:32.320> working<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.590> together

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
project that we were working on together

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.620 
project that we were working on together
even<00:03:33.310> when<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.519> weren't<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.940> road<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.510> it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
even when we weren't on the road and it

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.259 
even when we weren't on the road and it
certainly<00:03:35.019> was<00:03:35.459> good<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.640> sense<00:03:36.880> for<00:03:37.180> us

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
certainly was good in the sense for us

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.949 
certainly was good in the sense for us
that<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.690> know<00:03:37.810> just<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:39.010> know<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.400> that

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
that you know just you know and that

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.750 
that you know just you know and that
time<00:03:40.959> frame<00:03:41.290> Leroy<00:03:41.829> had<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.310> passed<00:03:42.489> away

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
time frame Leroy had just passed away

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.599 
time frame Leroy had just passed away
and<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:43.840> think<00:03:44.500> some<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.859> comes<00:03:45.280> through

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
and I think some of that comes through

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.479 
and I think some of that comes through
and<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.230> idea<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.380> Boyd<00:03:47.590> had<00:03:47.829> for<00:03:48.069> this<00:03:48.220> film

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
and and idea that Boyd had for this film

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.690 
and and idea that Boyd had for this film
that<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.180> think<00:03:50.170> it's<00:03:50.290> transparent<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.310> it

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
that I think it's transparent that it

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.420 
that I think it's transparent that it
was<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> release<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.810> know<00:03:53.140> about<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:54.040> dealing

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
was a release you know about and dealing

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.729 
was a release you know about and dealing
with<00:03:54.579> grief<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.569> having<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> move

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
with grief and and having to move

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.240 
with grief and and having to move
