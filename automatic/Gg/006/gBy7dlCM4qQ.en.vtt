00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and it looks like I got the bell housing

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.780 
and it looks like I got the bell housing
off<00:00:10.080> looks<00:00:10.469> like<00:00:10.620> everything's<00:00:11.040> good<00:00:11.309> inside

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
off looks like everything's good inside

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.280 
off looks like everything's good inside
I<00:00:12.179> don't<00:00:12.330> know<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> can<00:00:12.660> see<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.110> there

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I don't know if you can see it in there

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.240 
I don't know if you can see it in there
but<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:14.099> looks<00:00:14.309> pretty<00:00:14.460> good<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.030> think<00:00:16.220> what<00:00:17.220> I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
but it looks pretty good I think what I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300 
but it looks pretty good I think what I
missed<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.270> small<00:00:18.570> bolt<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.439> kind

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
missed was one small bolt that was kind

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.450 
missed was one small bolt that was kind
of<00:00:20.369> hidden<00:00:20.580> by<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.439> by<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:23.720> better<00:00:24.720> support

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
of hidden by the by the better support

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
of hidden by the by the better support
so<00:00:26.460> i<00:00:26.490> missed<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.960> was

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
like they got everything pretty much

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.580 
like they got everything pretty much
squared<00:00:34.710> away<00:00:35.540> that's<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> back<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> no

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
squared away that's the back of it no

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.420 
squared away that's the back of it no
you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:39.200> wait<00:00:40.200> until<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> dark

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you can wait until more kind of dark

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.020 
you can wait until more kind of dark
here<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.530> see<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> side

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
here but see here that that's the side

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.319 
here but see here that that's the side
of<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.280> off<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.879> everything

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of it and I got it all off so everything

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
of it and I got it all off so everything
is<00:00:48.450> cool<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.350> side<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
is cool on this side so that's the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
is cool on this side so that's the
tranche<00:00:51.510> hopes<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:52.590> good

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
tranche hopes like it's in pretty good

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.389 
tranche hopes like it's in pretty good

there<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> try<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> rust

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
there to try and get some of that rust

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
there to try and get some of that rust
off<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.050> there's<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.350> too<00:01:01.559> bad<00:01:01.800> nothing<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
of those and next to applications I got

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
of those and next to applications I got
to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:21.090> off<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> clutch<00:01:21.689> disc<00:01:21.960> as

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to get to get off this clutch disc as
