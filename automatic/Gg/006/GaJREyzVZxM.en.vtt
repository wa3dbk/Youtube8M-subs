00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
economic advantage you can really try to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
economic advantage you can really try to
stomp<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.070> stork<00:00:38.610> before<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.210> back

that<00:02:30.140> was<00:02:30.320> part<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.710> he<00:02:30.830> was<00:02:30.920> doing<00:02:31.190> there

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
that was part of what he was doing there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.400 
that was part of what he was doing there
basically<00:02:31.610> catching<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.210> tanks<00:02:32.570> before

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
basically catching these tanks before

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.860 
basically catching these tanks before
they<00:02:33.710> took<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.040> damage<00:02:34.310> from<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.840> from<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
they took the damage from the from the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.630 
they took the damage from the from the
dragoons<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:36.920> certainly<00:02:37.370> is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
dragoons and that that certainly is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.510 
dragoons and that that certainly is
critical<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.270> mean<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.510> micro<00:02:39.020> has<00:02:39.170> really

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
critical I mean this micro has really

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.340 
critical I mean this micro has really
continue<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.610> hurt<00:02:40.760> stork<00:02:41.150> fancy<00:02:41.960> now<00:02:42.110> moving

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
continue to hurt stork fancy now moving

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.370 
continue to hurt stork fancy now moving
in<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> natural<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.300> storks<00:02:44.810> oh<00:02:45.020> man

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
in to the natural of storks oh man

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.740 
in to the natural of storks oh man
stroking<00:02:45.710> torn<00:02:46.280> apart<00:02:46.370> here<00:02:46.850> economically

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
stroking torn apart here economically

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.290 
stroking torn apart here economically
and<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.350> think<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.460> know<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.120> saying

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
and I think you know like I was saying

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and I think you know like I was saying
before<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.660> think<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.990> verdict<00:02:51.290> was

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
before I think the verdict was

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.050 
before I think the verdict was
determined<00:02:51.860> when<00:02:51.950> he<00:02:52.040> lost<00:02:52.250> his<00:02:52.460> natural<00:02:52.910> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
determined when he lost his natural I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.930 
determined when he lost his natural I
think<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.600> rest<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.960> just<00:02:53.990> basically<00:02:54.940> you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
think the rest is just basically you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
think the rest is just basically you
know<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:57.050> basically<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.950> show<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.450> I'm

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
know just basically just a show and I'm

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.380 
know just basically just a show and I'm
just<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.380> sure<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:01.070> store<00:03:01.670> could<00:03:01.970> ever<00:03:02.150> have

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
just not sure that store could ever have

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.730 
just not sure that store could ever have
come<00:03:02.570> back<00:03:02.750> although<00:03:02.990> he<00:03:03.200> certainly<00:03:03.410> has<00:03:03.620> made

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
come back although he certainly has made

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.940 
come back although he certainly has made
a<00:03:03.800> good<00:03:03.950> try<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:05.320> still<00:03:06.320> fantasy<00:03:06.770> looks

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
a good try of it still fantasy looks

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.980 
a good try of it still fantasy looks
like<00:03:07.130> he's<00:03:07.790> probably<00:03:08.090> gonna<00:03:08.240> take<00:03:08.540> down<00:03:08.690> part

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
like he's probably gonna take down part

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.600 
like he's probably gonna take down part
of<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.140> wall<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.560> move<00:03:09.770> more<00:03:09.950> units<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
of that wall and move more units in and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.940 
of that wall and move more units in and
really<00:03:11.240> stork<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.990> does<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:12.320> have<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.710> tank

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
really stork just does not have the tank

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.530 
really stork just does not have the tank
does<00:03:13.130> not<00:03:13.310> have<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.550> number<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.880> units<00:03:14.120> to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
does not have the number of units to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.850 
does not have the number of units to
take<00:03:14.690> care<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.020> all<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.290> he<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:15.500> going<00:03:15.710> to<00:03:15.800> try

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
take care of all this he is going to try

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.500 
take care of all this he is going to try
go<00:03:16.040> for<00:03:16.190> an<00:03:16.280> attack<00:03:16.550> that's<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.850> smart<00:03:17.180> move<00:03:17.360> i

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
go for an attack that's a smart move i

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.750 
go for an attack that's a smart move i
think<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.010> know<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.190> really<00:03:19.520> just

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
think in that you know you really just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.980 
think in that you know you really just
have<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.060> keep<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.300> initiative<00:03:20.720> when<00:03:20.870> you're

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
have to keep the initiative when you're

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.020 
have to keep the initiative when you're
behind<00:03:21.080> like<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.010> really<00:03:22.220> cannot<00:03:22.730> let

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
behind like this you really cannot let

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.820 
behind like this you really cannot let
the<00:03:23.209> enemy<00:03:23.630> dictate<00:03:24.020> more<00:03:24.230> attacks<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.740> you

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
the enemy dictate more attacks for you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.570 
the enemy dictate more attacks for you
it<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.010> will<00:03:25.820> not<00:03:26.300> work<00:03:26.630> all<00:03:27.590> right<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.040> stork

although I think tanks are going to stop

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.810 
although I think tanks are going to stop
that<00:04:01.280> very<00:04:01.610> soon<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.800> stork<00:04:03.800> definitely<00:04:04.640> has<00:04:04.790> a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
in this game I feel right now he is uh

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.780 
in this game I feel right now he is uh
well<00:04:11.090> he's<00:04:11.330> managed<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.780> expand<00:04:12.230> twice<00:04:12.790> but

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
well he's managed to expand twice but

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.960 
well he's managed to expand twice but
soul<00:04:14.330> has<00:04:14.750> fantasy<00:04:15.739> stork<00:04:16.700> right<00:04:16.850> now

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
soul has fantasy stork right now

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.699 
soul has fantasy stork right now
bringing<00:04:17.270> three<00:04:17.510> zealots<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.470> upper

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
bringing three zealots up to the upper

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.920 
bringing three zealots up to the upper
left<00:04:19.220> looks<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:19.910> fantasy<00:04:20.299> could<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.720> mike

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
left looks like fantasy could have mike

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.360 
left looks like fantasy could have mike
road<00:04:21.140> against<00:04:21.500> them<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:21.680> he's<00:04:21.859> not<00:04:22.040> going<00:04:22.100> to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
road against them but he's not going to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.740 
road against them but he's not going to
so<00:04:22.880> those<00:04:23.030> zealots<00:04:23.180> are<00:04:23.330> going<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.510> survive

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
so those zealots are going to survive

ground<00:04:45.510> here<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:47.120> looks<00:04:48.120> like<00:04:48.270> he's<00:04:48.480> going<00:04:48.630> to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
ground here and looks like he's going to

dropship<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.150> think<00:04:52.020> right<00:04:52.230> now<00:04:52.470> stork<00:04:53.310> is

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
dropship I think right now stork is

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.300 
dropship I think right now stork is
doing<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.940> decent<00:04:54.690> job<00:04:54.990> harassing<00:04:55.980> although

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
doing a decent job harassing although

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.790 
doing a decent job harassing although
like<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:57.030> said<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> still<00:04:57.810> think<00:04:58.020> he's<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.410> little

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
like I said I still think he's a little

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.250 
like I said I still think he's a little
bit<00:04:59.070> behind<00:04:59.390> from<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.540> previous<00:05:00.990> exchange

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
bit behind from the previous exchange

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.310 
bit behind from the previous exchange
we're<00:05:01.680> going<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.860> see<00:05:01.980> if<00:05:02.100> stork<00:05:02.460> can<00:05:02.910> use<00:05:03.090> his

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
we're going to see if stork can use his

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.930 
we're going to see if stork can use his
magical<00:05:04.320> recuperation<00:05:04.980> skills<00:05:05.490> though<00:05:05.730> his

ridiculous odds in the past in fact it's

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.870 
ridiculous odds in the past in fact it's
often<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.680> hallmark<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.220> his<00:05:14.340> games<00:05:14.610> actually

often a hallmark of his games actually

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.180 
often a hallmark of his games actually
that<00:05:15.150> he<00:05:15.270> wins<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:16.230> he<00:05:16.440> oh<00:05:16.470> he<00:05:16.620> falls

dropship<00:07:16.150> he's<00:07:17.150> also<00:07:17.330> up<00:07:17.600> to<00:07:17.750> Templar

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
dropship he's also up to Templar

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.800 
dropship he's also up to Templar
archives<00:07:18.580> he's<00:07:19.580> got<00:07:19.760> a<00:07:19.790> lot<00:07:20.090> of<00:07:20.150> gateways<00:07:20.570> that

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
archives he's got a lot of gateways that

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.990 
archives he's got a lot of gateways that
looks<00:07:21.020> like<00:07:21.140> ten<00:07:21.380> gateways<00:07:21.770> very<00:07:22.580> very<00:07:22.820> good

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
looks like ten gateways very very good

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.420 
looks like ten gateways very very good
and<00:07:23.810> I<00:07:23.990> think<00:07:24.020> now<00:07:24.440> he<00:07:24.500> will<00:07:24.830> have<00:07:24.980> the<00:07:25.010> economy

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
and I think now he will have the economy

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.520 
and I think now he will have the economy
to<00:07:25.520> back<00:07:25.700> it<00:07:25.850> up<00:07:25.960> notice<00:07:26.960> that<00:07:26.990> store<00:07:27.380> can

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
to back it up notice that store can

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.710 
to back it up notice that store can
smoke<00:07:27.710> cannons<00:07:28.130> around<00:07:28.490> all<00:07:28.730> of<00:07:28.850> his<00:07:28.970> exposé<00:07:29.450> I

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
smoke cannons around all of his exposé I

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.020 
smoke cannons around all of his exposé I
think<00:07:30.200> that's<00:07:30.350> a<00:07:30.410> hallmark<00:07:30.620> of<00:07:30.980> safe<00:07:31.490> play<00:07:31.820> as

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 
think that's a hallmark of safe play as

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.870 
think that's a hallmark of safe play as
a<00:07:32.060> Protoss<00:07:32.480> vs<00:07:32.900> terran<00:07:33.440> and<00:07:33.740> I<00:07:34.190> always<00:07:34.550> I

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
a Protoss vs terran and I always I

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.580 
a Protoss vs terran and I always I
always<00:07:35.120> pointed<00:07:35.540> out<00:07:35.660> I<00:07:35.690> always<00:07:36.169> liked<00:07:36.380> it

always pointed out I always liked it

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.640 
always pointed out I always liked it

against terran state even the mid game
late<00:07:44.660> game<00:07:44.870> they<00:07:45.050> don't<00:07:45.290> build<00:07:45.650> those<00:07:45.919> cannons
