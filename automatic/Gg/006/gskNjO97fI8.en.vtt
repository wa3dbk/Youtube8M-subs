 they will say that wall that is strange 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 Well, as we can see, the wall is very 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.360
 long inside but outside the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.189
 shop is very small see it if we go out 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.080
 we can notice that the wall is very 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.080
 small and inside is longer 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.700
 another mystery is this wall where 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.040
 there is the ambulation poster as 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.050
 we can notice the wall is very long 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.920
 outside but inside there is no such 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.920
 wall view 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.030
 another mystery of the business is this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.520
 kind of room a small room 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 the strange thing about this room is that there is no 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.080
 entry into the business that takes us 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.080
 until he is only there of ornament xd 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 and if we go to the back we can 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.799
 appreciate that there is a door this door 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.049
 seems to have bullet holes as if 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.150
 someone would have balanced it the weird 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.459
 of this door is that if we enter the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.299
 business this door is not where 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.150
 I should be 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.150
 it's as if it's only on the outside see 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.320
 how can you notice the door is not alone 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.630
 there are those white images but the 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.630
 door is not as if it did not exist 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.920

 mysteries of this arms business 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.870
 what do you think is a mystery 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.879
 or it's just a game error on the outside 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.099
 it looks a way but inside it 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.319

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.780
 game to the best rock star did not notice
