so<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.989> first<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
so the first one I don't know if it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
so the first one I don't know if it
counts<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.850> number<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.629> number<00:01:00.870> zero

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
counts that's number one or number zero

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.570 
counts that's number one or number zero
which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
which is this one because this one is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
which is this one because this one is
where<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.000> start<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.619> know

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
where you start off of but I don't know

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.100 
where you start off of but I don't know
if<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> first<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.689> number<00:01:10.350> zero<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
if it's the first one or number zero and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
if it's the first one or number zero and
it's<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.320> confusing<00:01:13.580> because<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.030> call<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's really confusing because in call of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.130

duty normally its number zero because

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.010 
duty normally its number zero because
you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> prestige<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.250> promoted<00:01:20.790> yet

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
think that the tents promotion should be

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.320 
think that the tents promotion should be
the<00:05:58.210> chance<00:05:58.450> one<00:05:59.430> because<00:06:00.430> this<00:06:00.760> is<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:01.090> tenth

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
the chance one because this is the tenth

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.030 
the chance one because this is the tenth
and<00:06:02.700> it's<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.880> panda<00:06:04.300> it's<00:06:05.170> kind<00:06:05.350> of<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:05.500> joke<00:06:05.740> i

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
and it's a panda it's kind of a joke i

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.740 
and it's a panda it's kind of a joke i
guess<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.640> could<00:06:06.790> say<00:06:07.000> because<00:06:07.360> i<00:06:07.540> don't

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
guess you could say because i don't

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.260 
guess you could say because i don't
think<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.890> should<00:06:09.040> be<00:06:09.220> a<00:06:09.250> bike<00:06:09.640> at<00:06:09.910> me<00:06:10.120> it

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
think that it should be a bike at me it

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.260 
think that it should be a bike at me it
should<00:06:10.420> be<00:06:10.570> like<00:06:10.690> number<00:06:11.110> four<00:06:11.760> number<00:06:12.760> three
