00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
abilities I had to really think through

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.659

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
other stuff that your party would

other stuff that your party would
normally<00:05:31.530> handle<00:05:31.889> for<00:05:32.099> you<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.669> have<00:05:33.000> to

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
normally handle for you you have to

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.650 
normally handle for you you have to
trust<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.960> AI<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.590> deal<00:05:35.400> with<00:05:35.610> sometimes<00:05:36.300> it's

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
trust the AI to deal with sometimes it's

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.680 
trust the AI to deal with sometimes it's
not<00:05:36.810> as<00:05:36.960> good<00:05:37.169> for<00:05:37.200> it<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:37.919> by<00:05:38.400> having<00:05:38.690> party

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
not as good for it so by having party

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.350 
not as good for it so by having party
members<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.650> actually<00:05:41.190> be<00:05:41.340> you<00:05:41.550> by<00:05:41.880> making

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
members not actually be you by making

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.210 
members not actually be you by making
sure<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.020> represent<00:05:43.590> only<00:05:44.010> your

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
sure that you represent only your

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.800 
sure that you represent only your
character<00:05:44.729> within<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.090> narrative<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.599> thus

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
character within the narrative and thus

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.869 
character within the narrative and thus
also<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.169> mechanics

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
also the mechanics

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.529 
also the mechanics
game<00:05:47.149> they<00:05:48.129> combat<00:05:49.129> ramps<00:05:49.520> up<00:05:49.699> yet<00:05:50.240> another

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
game they combat ramps up yet another

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.839 
game they combat ramps up yet another
notch<00:05:50.839> so<00:05:51.619> there's<00:05:52.039> definitely<00:05:52.249> some<00:05:52.520> very

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
notch so there's definitely some very

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.040 
notch so there's definitely some very
challenging<00:05:53.059> combat<00:05:53.569> scenarios<00:05:54.459> finally

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
challenging combat scenarios finally

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.409 
challenging combat scenarios finally
this<00:05:57.050> was<00:05:57.860> mean<00:05:58.839> back<00:06:00.369> before<00:06:01.369> the<00:06:02.029> dragon

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
this was mean back before the dragon

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.879 
this was mean back before the dragon
fall<00:06:02.749> expansion<00:06:03.349> for<00:06:03.800> Shadowrun<00:06:05.409> which<00:06:06.409> means

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
fall expansion for Shadowrun which means

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.709 
fall expansion for Shadowrun which means
that<00:06:07.189> it<00:06:07.309> was<00:06:07.399> made<00:06:07.580> before<00:06:07.879> shadow<00:06:08.509> run

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
that it was made before shadow run

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.559 
that it was made before shadow run
actually<00:06:09.169> let<00:06:09.379> you<00:06:09.469> save<00:06:09.800> at<00:06:10.099> will<00:06:10.490> this<00:06:11.360> was<00:06:11.539> a

actually let you save at will this was a

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.510 
actually let you save at will this was a
problem<00:06:11.839> of<00:06:11.990> shadowrun<00:06:12.349> returns<00:06:12.379> the<00:06:13.099> only

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
problem of shadowrun returns the only

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.829 
problem of shadowrun returns the only
times<00:06:13.759> you<00:06:13.939> could<00:06:14.089> save<00:06:14.300> in<00:06:14.479> shadowrun

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:14.839 
times you could save in shadowrun

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.659 
times you could save in shadowrun
returns<00:06:15.129> were<00:06:16.539> when<00:06:17.539> you<00:06:17.719> crossed<00:06:18.169> a<00:06:18.669> zone

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
returns were when you crossed a zone

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.009 
returns were when you crossed a zone
boundary<00:06:20.179> right<00:06:20.360> when<00:06:20.509> you<00:06:20.569> entered<00:06:20.809> a<00:06:20.899> new

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
building something of that nature so

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.820 
building something of that nature so
this<00:06:23.569> mind<00:06:23.749> is<00:06:23.839> actually<00:06:23.929> very<00:06:24.169> cleverly<00:06:24.559> made

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
this mind is actually very cleverly made

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.879 
this mind is actually very cleverly made
it's<00:06:25.459> littered<00:06:26.119> with<00:06:26.149> new<00:06:26.959> buildings<00:06:27.409> its<00:06:27.709> own
