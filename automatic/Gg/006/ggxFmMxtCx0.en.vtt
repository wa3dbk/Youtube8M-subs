00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
obviously you're not going to get the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.170

display but I think it's pretty good for

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.499 
display but I think it's pretty good for
the<00:01:34.280> purpose<00:01:34.729> would<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.090> think<00:01:43.150> ok<00:01:44.150> well<00:01:44.360> as

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509
