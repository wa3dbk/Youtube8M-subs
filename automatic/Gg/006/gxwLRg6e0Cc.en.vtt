got no problem also they told me that
they<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> computer<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.579> another<00:00:50.820> engine

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
they use the computer in another engine

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.290 
they use the computer in another engine
and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.870> running<00:00:52.170> perfect<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> problem

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and it was running perfect the problem

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.410 
and it was running perfect the problem
died<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.649> reave<00:00:55.860> find<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.030> there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
died that will reave find out is there

died that will reave find out is there
are<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.780> principal<00:00:58.289> problems<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.550> first<00:00:59.789> one

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
are two principal problems the first one

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.120 
are two principal problems the first one
is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.680> simple<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:06.470> these<00:01:07.470> wire<00:01:07.770> that's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is a very simple one these wire that's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880 
is a very simple one these wire that's
supposed<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> give<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:09.810> ground<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
supposed to give some ground to the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.679 
supposed to give some ground to the
starter<00:01:11.310> solenoid<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.299> getting<00:01:12.570> in

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
starter solenoid is not getting in

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.819 
starter solenoid is not getting in
ground<00:01:13.640> okay<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:15.659> ground

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
ground okay I got no ground

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.060 
ground okay I got no ground
the<00:01:18.130> engine<00:01:18.490> block<00:01:18.670> giving<00:01:19.270> me<00:01:19.359> ground<00:01:20.070> this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
the engine block giving me ground this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.730 
the engine block giving me ground this
little<00:01:21.729> time<00:01:22.000> with<00:01:22.630> onion<00:01:22.990> with<00:01:23.320> which<00:01:23.530> on<00:01:23.710> a

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
little time with onion with which on a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.959 
little time with onion with which on a
rock<00:01:24.009> he<00:01:24.310> got<00:01:24.490> nothing

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
rock he got nothing

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.789 
rock he got nothing
I<00:01:25.000> already<00:01:25.780> took<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.020> wire<00:01:26.229> all<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.500> way<00:01:26.679> to

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
I already took the wire all the way to

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.029 
I already took the wire all the way to
the<00:01:27.070> pink<00:01:27.460> 22<00:01:28.000> on<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.210> EMM<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:29.860> got

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
the pink 22 on the EMM and you got

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.130 
the pink 22 on the EMM and you got
continuity<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> cable<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.539> not<00:01:31.569> broken<00:01:31.960> or

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
continuity so the cable is not broken or

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.690 
continuity so the cable is not broken or
stuff<00:01:32.649> like<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.829> it's<00:01:33.100> working

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
stuff like that it's working

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.059 
stuff like that it's working
but<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.719> told<00:01:34.990> me<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.409> EMM<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.860> not

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
but I told me that the EMM is not

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.160 
but I told me that the EMM is not
working<00:01:36.729> okay<00:01:37.920> unit<00:01:38.920> tested<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.579> working<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
working okay unit tested is working so

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.219 
working okay unit tested is working so
what<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.009> did<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.459> put<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.000> jumper<00:01:43.450> jumper<00:01:43.780> cable

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
what I did is put a jumper jumper cable

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.010 
what I did is put a jumper jumper cable
from<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.069> negative<00:01:45.429> side<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.689> engine

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
from the negative side to the engine

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.410 
from the negative side to the engine
block<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:48.250> now<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.610> can<00:01:48.850> make<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.149> engine

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
block right now I can make the engine

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.719 
block right now I can make the engine
cranks<00:01:50.049> but<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.069> other<00:01:51.189> problem<00:01:51.579> is<00:01:51.670> that

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
cranks but the other problem is that

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.539 
cranks but the other problem is that
even<00:01:52.539> if<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.869> if<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.319> crank<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.099> on<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.280> engine

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
even if I if I crank in on the engine

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:01.710 
even if I if I crank in on the engine
you<00:01:54.759> won't<00:01:55.000> start<00:01:55.329> you<00:01:55.630> will<00:01:56.409> see<00:01:56.590> no<00:02:00.720> switch

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
you won't start you will see no switch

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.149 
you won't start you will see no switch
on<00:02:02.489> have<00:02:03.489> to<00:02:03.640> remember<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.039> we<00:02:06.039> already

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
on have to remember that and we already

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.550 
on have to remember that and we already
connected<00:02:07.119> save<00:02:07.539> every<00:02:07.810> software<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.410> then

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
connected save every software and then

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.680 
connected save every software and then
laptop<00:02:09.009> see<00:02:09.190> doesn't<00:02:09.489> show<00:02:09.640> any<00:02:10.000> code<00:02:10.360> though

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
laptop see doesn't show any code though

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.449 
laptop see doesn't show any code though
the<00:02:10.899> computer<00:02:11.260> says<00:02:11.410> engine<00:02:11.799> it's<00:02:11.920> perfect

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
the computer says engine it's perfect

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.839 
the computer says engine it's perfect
and<00:02:13.019> have<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.440> looks<00:02:14.650> kind<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.160> all<00:02:15.430> with
