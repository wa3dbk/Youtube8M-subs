the brakes are the one of the most
important<00:01:16.630> things<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.020> getting<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.259> stopped

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
when you're entering the corners but

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840 
when you're entering the corners but
they<00:01:20.080> don't<00:01:20.590> work<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:20.950> they're<00:01:21.100> cold<00:01:21.250> carbon

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
they don't work when they're cold carbon

fiber<00:01:21.970> brakes<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.539> not<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> normal<00:01:22.899> Road

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
fiber brakes and not like a normal Road

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.050 
fiber brakes and not like a normal Road
car<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.770> need<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.070> be<00:01:24.160> able<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.369> get<00:01:24.940> them

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
car so you need to be able to get them

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.210 
car so you need to be able to get them
up<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.240> something<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:25.810> 300<00:01:26.080> degrees<00:01:26.560> which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
up to something like 300 degrees which

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.100 
up to something like 300 degrees which
is<00:01:27.550> when<00:01:27.759> they<00:01:27.880> work<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.179> their<00:01:28.300> optimum<00:01:28.659> level

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
is when they work at their optimum level

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.740 
is when they work at their optimum level
without<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.190> ABS<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.789> without<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.600> power

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
without the ABS and without the power

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.440 
without the ABS and without the power
assistance<00:01:32.429> Nico<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.580> Lewis<00:01:33.610> have<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.270> press

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
assistance Nico and Lewis have to press

the<00:01:34.630> pedal<00:01:34.899> up<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.259> hundred<00:01:35.470> kilos<00:01:36.069> maybe

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
the pedal up to a hundred kilos maybe

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.139 
the pedal up to a hundred kilos maybe
600<00:01:37.840> or<00:01:37.960> 800<00:01:38.229> times<00:01:38.860> per<00:01:39.159> race<00:01:39.369> the

600 or 800 times per race the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.309 
600 or 800 times per race the
interesting<00:01:40.509> thing<00:01:40.569> about<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.899> Formula<00:01:41.289> One

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
interesting thing about a Formula One

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.249 
interesting thing about a Formula One
car<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.460> takes<00:01:43.090> less<00:01:43.450> distance<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:43.990> stop

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
car is that takes less distance to stop

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.410 
car is that takes less distance to stop
a<00:01:44.289> Formula<00:01:44.679> One<00:01:44.710> car<00:01:44.860> from<00:01:45.280> 160<00:01:46.030> kilometres

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
a Formula One car from 160 kilometres

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600 
a Formula One car from 160 kilometres
now<00:01:46.630> than<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.170> does<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.349> road<00:01:47.560> car<00:01:47.800> from<00:01:48.069> 100

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
now than it does a road car from 100

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.279 
now than it does a road car from 100
kilometers<00:01:49.030> an<00:01:49.119> hour<00:01:49.209> when<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:49.810> first<00:01:50.080> drove

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
kilometers an hour when I first drove

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.290 
kilometers an hour when I first drove
when<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.679> was<00:01:50.890> 17<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.700> was<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.060> incredible

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
when I was 17 it was just incredible

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.029 
when I was 17 it was just incredible
yeah<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:52.899> went<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.380> first<00:01:53.560> corner<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:53.979> I

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
yeah I went to the first corner and I

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.669 
yeah I went to the first corner and I
hit<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> brakes<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.929> g-force<00:01:56.379> is<00:01:56.470> so

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
hit the brakes and the g-force is so

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.529 
hit the brakes and the g-force is so
strong<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.610> didn't<00:01:57.819> expect<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.239> so<00:01:58.300> my

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
strong that I didn't expect it so my

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.290 
strong that I didn't expect it so my
head<00:01:58.750> went<00:01:59.319> straight<00:01:59.679> down<00:01:59.709> into<00:02:00.069> my<00:02:00.429> legs<00:02:00.640> and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
head went straight down into my legs and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.090 
head went straight down into my legs and
I<00:02:01.450> couldn't<00:02:01.629> see<00:02:01.780> where<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:01.959> was<00:02:01.989> going<00:02:02.140> anymore

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
I couldn't see where I was going anymore

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.609 
I couldn't see where I was going anymore
and<00:02:04.580> we've<00:02:04.729> breaks<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.270> powerful<00:02:05.840> it's

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and we've breaks this powerful it's

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.190 
and we've breaks this powerful it's
possible<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.130> drive<00:02:07.310> much<00:02:07.820> closer<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.020> car

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
possible to drive much closer to the car

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.199 
possible to drive much closer to the car
