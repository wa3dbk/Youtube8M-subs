00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.599
 it is 150 meters above 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.059
 of vulcania so basically we are in onsan 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.590
 230 meters above sea level yes it's 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 interesting to see things for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 true in reality we can talk about things 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
 with movies with animations with 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.750
 attractions and pass 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 messages but there is nothing that is more 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 convincing to the man that his senses and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890
 its direct senses and so when we see there 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.320
 truly the chain of puys 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 since altitude is already a very 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 beautiful emotion there are sensations 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 strong since we actually have a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.760
 vision and vulcania and its 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 environment and the beauty of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.829
 Auvergne from the sky but also 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.080
 we have precisely this real vision of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 things that mark a lot more the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.100
 minds and that makes them much more 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.480
 credible for at 150 meters altitude at 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 above the winning goal we have a very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.199
 beautiful vision of the central part of the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.190
 chain of puys and not only the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 string folds but its environment 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.820
 since volcanoes are recent they have 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.009
 a few thousand years and they are 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.149
 more opposite on a granitic plateau 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.920
 and the dom plateau 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.170
 so when we look around we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 actually sees this dom plateau 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.590
 with its meadows and woods and its 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.050
 cows and then we see the chain of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.840
 puys in the middle part by going 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.080
 from the hot water well yesterday to the north 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.009
 until the pit commits and how to puy 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.259
 dome to the south 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.060
 so we can see this succession of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.500
 volcanoes juxtapose next to each other 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 others and that is a very beautiful 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.369
 illustration of what is a chain 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 volcanic a chain of small volcano 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.970
 do not see that because if we look 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.689
 a little bit to the east we also have a 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.070
 very beautiful vision on the limagne for the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.750
 eastern part of germany so this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 gap of collapse in which 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 locate the big cities 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 two departments of puy-de-dome and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 from auvergne clermont ferrand among others 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.330
 we mostly see it works oriental a 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.399
 completely to the east with snakes 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.380
 eastern side of third parties and with 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.090
 black wood she forest last and then 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 we also have the opportunity to have a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 very beautiful vision on one of the big 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 stratovolcano of the central massif which is 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.560
 the puy de sancy and the massif des Monts 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.760
 of which he is a member of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.800
 sancy who is behind me with his 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.080
 snowflakes right now one even if one is 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 quite advanced in season there are often 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.850
 the snow very late in season since 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.590
 culminates at 1186 m 106 so and we have this 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.239
 beautiful vision not of a small volcano 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.140
 mono throw ethnic like this the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.560
 chain of puys but of a big 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.959
 stratovolcano 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.580
 of very large size there is still 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.470
 bigger south 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.819
 it's the cantal but we do not see it 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.810
 here he is hidden by the well of like 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.810
 behind
