00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
got for winning but one point isn't the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830

there it was a shot from I think Lucas

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.580

out on the wing and Menace was the one

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.550 
out on the wing and Menace was the one
that<00:05:19.770> converted<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:21.060> another<00:05:21.900> great

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
that converted it but another great

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.649 
that converted it but another great
chance<00:05:22.889> for<00:05:23.070> him<00:05:23.250> how<00:05:23.460> does<00:05:23.759> that<00:05:23.940> almost<00:05:24.449> go

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
chance for him how does that almost go

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.020 
chance for him how does that almost go
in<00:05:24.780> that<00:05:24.900> vucinic<00:05:25.380> shot<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.889> ball<00:05:26.610> comes<00:05:26.880> out

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030

in that vucinic shot and ball comes out
off<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.389> bar<00:05:27.569> and<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:27.930> was<00:05:28.050> Tevez<00:05:28.470> that<00:05:28.620> dived

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
off the bar and it was Tevez that dived

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.680

and<00:05:30.840> make<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.080> 2-2<00:05:31.259> so<00:05:31.620> we<00:05:31.710> do<00:05:31.830> need<00:05:31.979> these

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
and make it 2-2 so we do need these
