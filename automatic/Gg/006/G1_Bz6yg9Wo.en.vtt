00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.030
 I'm the isabela de castro teacher. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.820
 Maracatu River Dance Workshop I'm here 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.510
 to talk about the wheel of the coconut 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.510
 wheel hockey cavatton sent me 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.930
 I was in the juazeiro of heaven both ceará 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 To talk about coconut wheel people. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.309
 It can be traced back a story that is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 prostitute body coconut pains fruit 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 so they worked up 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.719
 knocking down this coconut and then 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 of this body peeling this body 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.690
 making music by beating coconut shells 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.690
 in the well-marked rhythm, right? 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.289
 there are many types of wheel coconut 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.329
 because the regions are different 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.170
 workers are of different origins 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.149
 then this will explain variations of a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.899
 same joke then we have to 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.929
 example a more indigenous coconut or a 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.090
 little more the fruit and tambourine of the master 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:51.920
 I have coconut by heart, it's a coconut. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.920
 more indigenous parents and friends 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.820

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.250
 people can cite as an example well 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.840
 contemporary even the bongar group 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.599
 connected to the xambá terreiro and also 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 works with this most sacred side of the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.200
 coconuts 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.570
 finally old ro 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.580
 the sea 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.460
 this mega box 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.019
 as there are several types of 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.769
 coconut thanks body names 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.670

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.760
 coco coconut and coco coconut 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.190
 coconut samba is because the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.220
 play a part in that healthy life and it's 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.410
 precisely in this change that makes the wheel 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.380
 and this wheel is the idea of people 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.390
 dance and couple but that ends 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.160
 The wheel mess is all right if this woman 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.180
 woman man with man does not have any 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 much trouble 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.299
 there is not much protocol for dancing 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.519

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.579

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.470
 You play, you get out, you hit the sings. 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.980
 fathers the body in a very 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.150
 Spontaneous has a good footing 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.420
 always marked on the foot 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:52.470
 right a year ago at the same time I know 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:55.139
 and then I realize that most of the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.930
 people who practice coconut in olinda 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:01.139
 they take to the same profane side 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.359
 where he will improvise much where he will create 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.889
 new songs because the body is very 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.200
 improvised body music a lot 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.750
 improvised up to a kind of any 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 which is very traditional. 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.120
 feature is improvised even where 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.139
 they will sometimes use double songs 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.660
 sense 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.239
 the owner of coconut selma she did a lot 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.340
 success in an era with the music of 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.650
 that there is a song clearly 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.650
 double meaning 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.859
 also the appropriation of this culture 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.179
 the new composers are not coming personal 

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:35.329
 with the bit mango
