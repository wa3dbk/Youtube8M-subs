last<00:01:51.700> year<00:01:52.710> feels<00:01:53.710> like<00:01:54.010> coming<00:01:54.370> down<00:01:54.550> upon

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
last year feels like coming down upon

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.450 
last year feels like coming down upon
the<00:01:55.120> secondary<00:01:55.720> now<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:55.990> kind<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.530> step<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.250> up

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
the secondary now the kind of step it up

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.450 
the secondary now the kind of step it up
since<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.840> much<00:01:59.080> depth<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.770> defensive

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
since not much depth on the defensive

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.969 
since not much depth on the defensive
line<00:02:00.520> as<00:02:00.880> there<00:02:01.030> was<00:02:01.180> last<00:02:01.420> year<00:02:01.690> now

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
line as there was last year now

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.050 
line as there was last year now
secondary<00:02:02.979> might<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.670> strength<00:02:03.940> of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
secondary might be the strength of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.300 
secondary might be the strength of
defense<00:02:04.450> i<00:02:04.720> wanna<00:02:05.170> say<00:02:05.350> doesn't<00:02:05.650> mean<00:02:06.160> we

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
defense i wanna say doesn't mean we

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.440 
defense i wanna say doesn't mean we
always<00:02:06.460> felt<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.030> strength<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
always felt like the strength of the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.419 
always felt like the strength of the
defense<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.020> mean<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.830> go<00:02:09.009> out<00:02:09.070> there<00:02:09.340> and

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
defense I mean we go out there and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.949 
defense I mean we go out there and
compete<00:02:09.520> just<00:02:09.820> like<00:02:10.209> everybody<00:02:10.509> else<00:02:10.720> can

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
piece and we always thought we were the
