 everything is inhabited 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.250

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.700
 area that is already completely and completely 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 as mentioned in some of these 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.740
 parts of the presentation we have about 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 The land is house is not only 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 the 74 square meters that is the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.940
 equivalent to four and a half meters of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.840
 front by 16.5 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.030
 75 to be exact and we have 70 meters 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.410
 construction pictures on the ground 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.410
 low we have the spoon 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.990
 which is seen in the previous video 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.240
 the part of the dining room 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.479
 how is the house shows 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.790
 the kitchen is on this side and what it is 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.290
 the alcove that can be used as a third 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.920
 bedroom that there is also a picture of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.560
 she as well as the bathroom and already 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.930
 going up the stairs we access the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.229
 upstairs in this small lobby in 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.660
 where we have the bathroom the complete bathroom 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.890
 for both bedrooms and the two bedrooms 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.940
 with its respective space space to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.860
 for closet 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.540
 taking into account that this chamber 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.130
 front bedroom is slightly more 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.210
 big that the back bedroom so 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.400
 both could be used as 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.400
 like this the master bedroom 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 and in these in these photographs is the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.250
 that I mentioned in the previous video 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.190
 is where you see the decoration of the house 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.080
 sample 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.700
 where we have what is the bedroom or 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 ground floor where it is called the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.310
 bunk in this position placed 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.630
 the main chamber as we can 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 very wide 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.120
 very appropriate to disk space 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.430
 and the dining room area obviously 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.720
 for this house I put this note that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.720
 The decoration of the house shows 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.329
 It is not included but it gives us a great 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.329
 image 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.610
 remembering that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.610

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.670

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 at any time because the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.140
 the information and documentation is 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.140
 completely legal 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.880

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.880

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.959
