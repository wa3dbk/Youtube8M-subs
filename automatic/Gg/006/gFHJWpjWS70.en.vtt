00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.970
 many times we do not want to call the 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.529
 attention with our makeup because 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.440
 we have some important meeting with 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.269
 a job interview project by 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.980
 that's always good to have an ace under the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.509
 manga to know how to get a 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 Sober makeup but 3 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.320
 with this look is to do something very sober 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.230
 but at the same time 30 so let's do 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 a makeup in neutral colors 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 we start by applying a little bit of the base 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.050
 corrector to 5 in beige 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 with the twist eyeliner in black 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.159
 abstraction let's make a kind of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 base for the shadow that comes to 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.379
 continuation very sticky to the eyelashes 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.470
 superior but not so skinny 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.050
 free 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.870
 and then with a clean brush 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.600
 let's disarm that cut of a bit 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.790
 up so there is not a line like 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.540
 such that the base that we want remains 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.540
 for the others 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.760
 with the same black eyeliner we are going to 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.500
 make a line very close to the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
 lower tabs this is to create 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.950
 as the illusion that we have more 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 tabs 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 let's use the three colors of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 palette or clock in brownies and let's 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.039
 take this brown first and we're going to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.829
 apply on top of the base that we made 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.670
 with the black eyeliner and also in everything 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.670
 the eyelid moore 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.110
 this color of the half that has a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.990
 touch of pink red but also of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 brown let's apply it in the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.560
 depth of our eyes in this 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.540
 occasion we do not take the darker color 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.670
 to do the depth of the eyes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.979
 but we are making an effect on 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.350
 I degraded from the darkest color that is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.110
 the one that goes on the upper lashes 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.140
 up that goes clearing the first 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.630
 and to continue with this effect man 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.729
 let's take the color more clearly from the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.800
 palette that is almost white but with a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.100
 little touch of pink and we apply it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.840
 under the eyebrows to illuminate there and 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.760
 then in tears despite having 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.860
 a little bit of brightness these colors 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.780
 they are perfect for the day because if 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 they love you too much attention they shine me 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.590
 too much so they are perfect for 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.780
 a very natural look 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.970
 let's make up the face with the base 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.530
 cover martÃ­n secret life but also 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.140
 let's mix it with a bit of the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.060
 face expression cream which is a cream 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.440
 multi benefits that if you use it 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.769
 tiaras that protects from the rays 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.599
 solar and so we achieved as a showcase 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.640
 that in addition to covering all 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.709
 imperfections of the face is 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.390
 trying and taking care of your mechanics 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.250
 we go back to the corrective base uncontro 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 but this time we are going to use it to cover 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.510
 dark circles and all redness 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.310
 side of the nose and all those little things 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.170
 that we do not like they need a 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.170
 little bit more correction 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.459
 this huge charm two masks one 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.190
 brown and a black the brown to comb 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.830
 the cee well in the volume and shortened in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.099
 brown mania and then took the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.560
 pneumonia cord in black mania that is for 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.810
 the tabs so I'm going to apply a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.890
 pair of layers to finish with the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.890
 makeup of the eyes 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.600
 with checkmate dusts in mid 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.790
 confidential I will seal the base and the 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.769
 corrective base 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.109
 I'm going to give a little color to my 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.409
 cheeks with flush chic girl in teen 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.409
 kiss 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.370
 and with this labial expert time in extra 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.850
 pitch that is super natural in one color 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.160
 nude is beautiful with this makeup 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.110
 of the eyes complements perfect this 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.300
 look that we want natural well and we have 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.840
 finished with makeup now let's go 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.840
 with the theme 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.039
 but it was a wet touch so what 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.919
 first thing I did was dry it by 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.370
 assumption of roots to tips that remain 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.470
 well very dry before using the iron 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.320
 so now I'm going to do divisions 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.259
 to start smoothing it perfectly 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.830
 with my iron also from roots to 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.830
 tips 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.880
 now that it is completely smooth 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.580
 you have the option to leave your hair loose 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.070
 but for example if you are going to use this look 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.860
 for a job interview or something 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.410
 that you do not want your attention 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.600
 too much hair you can pick it up and a 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.540
 picked up very easy that also used in 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.810
 our pretty aunts moms is very 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.510
 nice already but it's very nice to do 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.390
 a tail next to you then divide the hair 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.100
 on the top and put the tail 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:44.160
 inside turn it over and it looks like that 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.490
 a super easy hairstyle a long time ago 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.990
 time so it's always very 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.880
 remember that accessories complement 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.920
 perfectly your look so 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.080
 depending on the occasion when you go 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.390
 to use this look with the most accessories 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.990
 big smaller ones pretty much 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.990
 striking 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.470
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.000

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.000
 I send a little kiss
