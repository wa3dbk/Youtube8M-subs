00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
coins and now he's gone up to 2,000
point<00:01:09.420> already<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.320> picked<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.310> Center

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.520 
back with a 74 pace he has a hawk
chemistry<00:01:15.420> style<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> whole<00:01:16.320> adds

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
chemistry style I think the whole adds

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.340 
chemistry style I think the whole adds
heading<00:01:17.009> shooting<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> case<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> quite

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
heading shooting and case which is quite

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
heading shooting and case which is quite
intriguing<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.670> pace<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.479> heading<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
intriguing for pace and heading for a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
intriguing for pace and heading for a
centre-back<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.799> hopefully<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.250> should<00:01:23.520> sell

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
centre-back so hopefully he should sell

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
centre-back so hopefully he should sell
for<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.060> amount<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.080> picked<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.380> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
for that amount and we picked up this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
for that amount and we picked up this
