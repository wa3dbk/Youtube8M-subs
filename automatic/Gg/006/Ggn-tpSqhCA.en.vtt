careers versus those that are started a
new<00:04:00.500> maybe<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.680> could<00:04:01.829> do<00:04:01.949> two<00:04:02.250> different

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519

career<00:04:02.970> paths<00:04:03.209> into<00:04:03.569> different<00:04:03.840> storylines

now<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.479> one<00:04:06.659> that<00:04:06.780> may<00:04:06.900> cause<00:04:07.169> a<00:04:07.199> little

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
now this is one that may cause a little

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.259 
now this is one that may cause a little
bit<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.620> controversy<00:04:07.979> I'm<00:04:08.489> okay<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.120> it

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
bit of controversy I'm okay with it

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.599 
bit of controversy I'm okay with it

would be a cool way to cross-promote

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.219 
would be a cool way to cross-promote
between<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.639> modes<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:24.120> well<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:25.050> if<00:04:25.139> you

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
between the modes as well so if you

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.230 
between the modes as well so if you
could<00:04:25.349> integrate<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.950> say<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.430> could<00:04:26.639> take<00:04:26.820> who

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
could integrate and say I could take who

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.540 
could integrate and say I could take who
the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550

VC to be able to do that to be honest

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.409 
VC to be able to do that to be honest
with<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:35.949> integrate<00:04:36.220> them<00:04:36.520> um<00:04:37.330> I

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
with you just integrate them um I

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.480 
with you just integrate them um I
realize<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.319> this<00:04:38.409> may<00:04:38.620> break<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.099> mode<00:04:39.280> but

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
realize that this may break the mode but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.850 
realize that this may break the mode but
honestly<00:04:39.879> it<00:04:40.180> wouldn't<00:04:40.780> be<00:04:40.990> any<00:04:41.169> more<00:04:41.409> broken

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
honestly it wouldn't be any more broken

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.369 
honestly it wouldn't be any more broken

so<00:04:52.419> also<00:04:53.319> I<00:04:53.650> want<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.830> go<00:04:53.949> with<00:04:54.069> play<00:04:54.280> styles

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
so also I want to go with play styles

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.300 
so also I want to go with play styles
and<00:04:54.970> team<00:04:55.539> chemistry<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.039> way<00:04:57.280> of

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and team chemistry this is a way of

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.700 
and team chemistry this is a way of
building<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:58.150> helping<00:04:58.930> bridge<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.289> gap<00:04:59.470> in

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
building the helping bridge the gap in

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.760 
building the helping bridge the gap in
AI<00:05:00.520> knowledge<00:05:01.240> based<00:05:01.750> on<00:05:01.930> what<00:05:02.110> difficulty

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
AI knowledge based on what difficulty

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.800 
AI knowledge based on what difficulty
and<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> problem<00:05:03.879> in<00:05:04.090> my<00:05:04.270> career<00:05:04.599> mode

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
and that is a problem in my career mode

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.839 
and that is a problem in my career mode
you<00:05:05.199> should<00:05:05.349> be<00:05:05.440> able<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.770> develop<00:05:06.219> individual

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
you should be able to develop individual

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.550 
you should be able to develop individual
chemistry<00:05:07.300> between<00:05:07.449> players<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.289> your<00:05:08.319> team

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
chemistry between players on your team

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.339 
chemistry between players on your team
for<00:05:09.250> example<00:05:09.580> being<00:05:09.729> a<00:05:09.849> point<00:05:10.060> guard<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:11.199> you

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
for example being a point guard if you

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.959 
for example being a point guard if you
run<00:05:11.560> ten<00:05:11.800> successful<00:05:12.400> pick<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.729> rolls<00:05:12.879> with

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
run ten successful pick and rolls with

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.879 
run ten successful pick and rolls with
Dwight<00:05:13.240> Howard<00:05:13.599> maybe<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.289> will<00:05:14.379> result<00:05:14.680> in

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
Dwight Howard maybe that will result in

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.649 
Dwight Howard maybe that will result in
a<00:05:14.949> five<00:05:15.190> percent<00:05:15.550> boost<00:05:15.909> to<00:05:16.090> your<00:05:16.150> chemistry

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
a five percent boost to your chemistry

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.749 
a five percent boost to your chemistry
with<00:05:16.930> him<00:05:17.229> individually<00:05:17.639> chemistry<00:05:18.639> with

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
with him individually chemistry with

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.430 
with him individually chemistry with
other<00:05:18.909> point<00:05:19.180> guards<00:05:19.300> shouldn't<00:05:19.810> be<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.169> hot

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
other point guards shouldn't be so hot

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.990 
other point guards shouldn't be so hot
obviously<00:05:21.099> because<00:05:21.250> you're<00:05:21.610> not<00:05:21.729> playing

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
obviously because you're not playing

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.700 
obviously because you're not playing
alongside<00:05:22.300> them<00:05:22.629> but<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.229> of<00:05:23.319> us<00:05:23.440> should<00:05:23.560> be

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
alongside them but all of us should be

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.350 
alongside them but all of us should be
able<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.979> be<00:05:24.069> developed<00:05:24.520> or<00:05:24.639> worked<00:05:24.940> on<00:05:25.150> within

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
the game that way instead of just oh

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.040 
the game that way instead of just oh
I've<00:05:28.060> got<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.300> answer<00:05:28.539> this<00:05:28.659> interview

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
I've got to answer this interview

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.629 
I've got to answer this interview
question<00:05:29.409> this<00:05:29.560> way<00:05:29.770> it's<00:05:29.949> actually<00:05:30.310> related

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
question this way it's actually related

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.909 
question this way it's actually related
to<00:05:30.849> what<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.180> do<00:05:31.360> on<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.659> court<00:05:31.870> maybe<00:05:32.529> you<00:05:32.740> do

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
to what you do on the court maybe you do

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.559 
to what you do on the court maybe you do
you<00:05:33.639> know<00:05:33.729> a<00:05:33.759> past<00:05:34.029> a<00:05:34.150> certain<00:05:34.300> number<00:05:34.449> of

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
you know a past a certain number of

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.180 
you know a past a certain number of
assists<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.169> Dwight<00:05:35.409> Howard<00:05:35.740> as<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.889> point

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
assists of Dwight Howard as a point

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.219 
assists of Dwight Howard as a point
guard<00:05:36.250> or<00:05:36.610> things<00:05:36.789> like<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:37.000> every<00:05:37.960> play

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
guard or things like that every play

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.959 
guard or things like that every play
that<00:05:38.409> you<00:05:38.500> make<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.860> game<00:05:39.130> could<00:05:39.699> register

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
that you make in the game could register

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.059 
that you make in the game could register
towards<00:05:40.569> your<00:05:40.719> chemistry<00:05:41.199> maybe<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:41.860> play

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
towards your chemistry maybe you play

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.920 
towards your chemistry maybe you play
alongside<00:05:42.400> other<00:05:42.789> people<00:05:43.029> better<00:05:43.210> now<00:05:43.599> so<00:05:43.750> it

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
alongside other people better now so it

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.600 
alongside other people better now so it
works<00:05:44.110> in<00:05:44.259> real<00:05:44.409> life<00:05:44.650> LeBron<00:05:45.250> James<00:05:45.520> and

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
works in real life LeBron James and

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.219 
works in real life LeBron James and
Dwyane<00:05:45.699> Wade<00:05:46.090> had<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.389> develop<00:05:46.569> chemistry<00:05:46.870> on

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
Dwyane Wade had to develop chemistry on

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.899 
Dwyane Wade had to develop chemistry on
the<00:05:47.319> court<00:05:47.529> and<00:05:47.650> it's<00:05:48.009> still<00:05:48.279> not<00:05:48.340> all<00:05:48.639> there

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
the court and it's still not all there

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.790 
the court and it's still not all there
they<00:05:49.090> have<00:05:49.270> their<00:05:49.419> moments<00:05:49.750> of<00:05:49.779> taken<00:05:50.139> over<00:05:50.229> so

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
they have their moments of taken over so

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.519 
they have their moments of taken over so
that's<00:05:50.979> just<00:05:51.069> an<00:05:51.279> example<00:05:51.370> also<00:05:51.969> coaches<00:05:52.870> Tom

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529 
that's just an example also coaches Tom

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.890 
that's just an example also coaches Tom
Thibodeau<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.919> Derrick<00:05:54.250> Rose<00:05:54.479> Phil<00:05:55.479> Jackson

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
and Michael Jordan Doc Rivers in the

and Michael Jordan Doc Rivers in the
Boston<00:05:58.090> Celtics<00:05:58.240> now<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.870> Clippers<00:05:59.169> the

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
Boston Celtics now the Clippers the

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.769 
Boston Celtics now the Clippers the
coaches<00:06:00.400> have<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.550> huge<00:06:00.879> effect<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.569> group

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
coaches have a huge effect on the group

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.330 
coaches have a huge effect on the group
there<00:06:01.990> with<00:06:02.139> I<00:06:02.379> think<00:06:02.770> this<00:06:02.860> would<00:06:03.009> be<00:06:03.039> made

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
there with I think this would be made

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.909 
there with I think this would be made
more<00:06:03.610> prevalent<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.330> play<00:06:04.810> into<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.259> I<00:06:05.469> think

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
more prevalent and play into the I think

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.170 
more prevalent and play into the I think
it<00:06:06.009> should<00:06:06.190> be<00:06:06.250> made<00:06:06.520> more<00:06:06.699> prevalent<00:06:07.120> i

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
it should be made more prevalent i

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.269 
it should be made more prevalent i
should<00:06:07.360> say<00:06:07.569> I'm<00:06:07.690> sorry<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.409> it<00:06:08.979> should<00:06:09.129> play

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
should say I'm sorry and it should play

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.700 
should say I'm sorry and it should play
into<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> play<00:06:09.759> styles<00:06:10.210> area<00:06:10.560> teams<00:06:11.560> with

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
into the play styles area teams with

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.100 
into the play styles area teams with
fast-break<00:06:12.639> chemistry<00:06:13.120> would<00:06:13.240> play<00:06:13.479> really

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
fast-break chemistry would play really

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.320 
fast-break chemistry would play really
well<00:06:14.319> under<00:06:14.590> D'Antoni<00:06:15.129> but<00:06:15.669> not<00:06:15.879> under<00:06:16.150> larry

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
well under D'Antoni but not under larry

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.649 
well under D'Antoni but not under larry
brown<00:06:16.629> for<00:06:16.870> example<00:06:17.259> coaches<00:06:17.800> need<00:06:17.919> chemistry

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
brown for example coaches need chemistry

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.420 
brown for example coaches need chemistry
all<00:06:19.659> right<00:06:19.900> so<00:06:20.289> that's<00:06:20.409> my<00:06:20.680> career<00:06:21.099> those<00:06:21.279> are

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
all right so that's my career those are

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.700 
all right so that's my career those are
the<00:06:21.520> things<00:06:21.669> that<00:06:21.879> I<00:06:21.940> see<00:06:22.150> straight<00:06:22.449> away

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
the things that I see straight away

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.749 
the things that I see straight away
besides<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.860> obvious<00:06:23.979> ones<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.460> a<00:06:24.490> lot<00:06:24.729> of

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
besides the obvious ones that a lot of
