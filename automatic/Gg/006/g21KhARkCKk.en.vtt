00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.660
 I have come to present you with a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.540
 video tutorial to perform the process 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.370
 of restoring your device with 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 this program is called semi restore 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 as you can appreciate it is designed to 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.580
 windows and for mac for linux is in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 process I believe that in a few weeks 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.859
 ends the development for that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 platform this program works with the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 third and fourth devices 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 generation from version 5 to the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.540
 last and it should be remembered that it does not work 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.270
 for iphone 5 with the year 613 and 614 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 here what happens this what is going to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.039
 happen is that if you have your program 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.039
 or your device is already very slow and you want 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.140
 restore it but without uploading to the version 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.470
 what 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.180
 but you propose apple you can perform 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.350
 a restoration without doing this process 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.410
 and without having them shs has the hand here 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.300
 you keep the cydia and your jailbreak if it is 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.610
 that you have it here once you 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.880
 we have clicked on simile restore as 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.970
 can appreciate our device is going to 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.680
 start has initialized fits 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.600
 mention that before starting this 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.909
 process I recommend you make a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.650
 support of all its programs and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.070
 applications through the tool 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.990
 from itunes this to avoid some 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 loss of information photographs 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 music 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.700
 with something that is important to them here 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 we're just going to wait for 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.540
 finish the restoration process 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 we put an iphone screen that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.570
 I have here connected where he goes to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.860
 appear the manzanita and the bar that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.860
 is filling little by little 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.580
 once you have finished the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 restoration our device is going to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.740
 to be as it comes from the factory we are going to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.439
 choose the language we want 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.450
 and configure the wifi and so on once 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.560
 that we have finished begins the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.410
 restoration of our device 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.550
 itunes is to say everything we have 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.550
 we have backed 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.120
 and once we have finished this 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 Well , our device is left with 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.370
 a cooler operating system 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.640
 faster and this applies to those who 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.310
 have problems with your goodbye and your 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.870
 device
