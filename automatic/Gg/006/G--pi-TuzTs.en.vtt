00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
there's multiple layers here just like

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.540 
there's multiple layers here just like
in<00:06:20.880> illustration<00:06:21.510> programs<00:06:22.020> on<00:06:22.200> the<00:06:22.290> PC<00:06:22.680> we

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
in illustration programs on the PC we

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.870 
in illustration programs on the PC we
can<00:06:23.670> go<00:06:23.820> in<00:06:24.030> we<00:06:24.180> can<00:06:24.360> even<00:06:24.750> group<00:06:25.320> these<00:06:25.560> layers

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
can go in we can even group these layers

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.420 
can go in we can even group these layers
so<00:06:26.880> I<00:06:27.000> can<00:06:27.470> make<00:06:28.470> both<00:06:28.680> of<00:06:28.710> these<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.250> same

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
so I can make both of these the same

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.160 
so I can make both of these the same
shape<00:06:29.760> if<00:06:29.940> I<00:06:30.060> want<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.360> reposition<00:06:30.720> that

shape if I want to reposition that

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.100 
shape if I want to reposition that
button<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:31.560> can<00:06:31.710> just<00:06:31.860> go<00:06:32.040> in<00:06:32.280> I<00:06:32.720> can<00:06:33.720> resize<00:06:34.080> it

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
button I can just go in I can resize it

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.600 
button I can just go in I can resize it
I<00:06:34.820> can<00:06:35.820> rotate<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.500> and<00:06:37.500> I<00:06:37.800> can<00:06:37.980> reposition<00:06:38.370> it

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
I can rotate it and I can reposition it

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.070 
I can rotate it and I can reposition it
so<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.820> want<00:06:39.060> that<00:06:39.240> button<00:06:39.540> to<00:06:39.660> sit<00:06:39.870> right<00:06:40.020> there

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
so I want that button to sit right there

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.860 
so I want that button to sit right there
