00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Halli hello after a very very long time 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.400
 time but somehow I'm always something 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.110
 came between 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.460
 and somehow the ideas went out too 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.840
 but now I thought so myself 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 Just make a video today 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000
 the corresponding driving programs at 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.619
 cupra 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 By now I'm fine too 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.810
 4000 km round can all actually 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.140
 according to say well now 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.060
 is what is bad and although you can 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.990
 via this button here the driving programs 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.990
 switch over if it works 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 accordingly very drive profi with ec and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.789
 like her comfort sport cupra and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 individual if i am here now 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.030
 profile information then i can go 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.379
 Let's see what that is now 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 applies the program 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.660
 that means that the cs on steer before 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 is normal 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.309
 then later explain what that means 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.120
 Motors on comfort suspected 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.129
 differential lock is also normal and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.330
 the climate is also normal so you can 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.000
 then imagine that now 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 not so much electricity pulls though that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 really something off the performance 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.020
 namely does not believe that the cs has 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 according gentle fathers the gentler 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.840
 steering is softer so the higher you go 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.840
 the harder the steering in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.530
 engine is a bit cozy all over 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.530
 ordinary teacher on sport 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 since it is dcc next to sport and the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.060
 everything else is motor on sport 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.510
 even with comfort that means it is one 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.850
 bit the car and a little bit 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.850
 Do not punish so extremely tight now 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 we have the cupra mode that's it 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.320
 Everything is in Cuba 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.320
 the steering is pretty taut and then 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.060
 the engine is really very direct so 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.510
 when you step through and through 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.100
 accelerates from zero to the second time 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.170
 really be careful so there 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 must bring problems without problems 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.350
 together the ssb intervenes and the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.910
 mature these start to spin 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.420
 But the curve is really up 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.250
 rails 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.989
 we still have an individual 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.120
 mode then you can do the appropriate 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.330
 that means I can s here 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.790
 comfort a dcc adjust the steering 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.320
 set everything can set 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.050
 I also reset the mode 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.060
 this is now my fun mode for 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.870
 the highway 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.209
 why and indeed the dcc is all nice 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.989
 and well it really taut 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:57.870
 So I would not from punch hole 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:01.510
 on something else like comfort but drive 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.290
 from 200 degrees even on the highway where 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.489
 one thinks he is all in order from 200 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.840
 hobbs the without end 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.540
 so it's like he jumps easily 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.239
 at simply the bumps are there and 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.430
 STCC easy to offenders so 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.140
 I have everything on cobra just that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.110
 Dcc on comfort because it is easy from the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.690
 buddy of the comfort as it is called beautiful 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.310
 is a lot more pleasant and that is 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.280
 then not so the car's turn 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.739
 and deflects bar or otherwise for color or 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.739
 so who over at speeds 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:43.840
 200, cobra is too crazy for sport 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.850
 But then comfort is actually 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.230
 no problem 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.960
 now I have appropriate long-term 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.030
 experience now almost a quarter 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.430
 arburg i have the car i can 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.180
 even say of fuel consumption is real 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.160
 the madness 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.430
 So if you look at that here 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.030
 and that is now starting the long time 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.750
 consumption is 8.8 liters 4000 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.470
 kilometers 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.550
 you can easily make the car possible 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.480
 easy if you really with now 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.320
 the bike is driving 130 motorway because there is no 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.709
 traffic obstruction or something else 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.000
 easily drive under eight liters 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.310
 long distance no problem at all 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.280
 and it's really comfortable too 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.040
 so drive my pizza to the end 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.140
 so my back hurt after 5 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.490
 600 kilometers that you really one 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.730
 took a break at the cooper 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.230
 Not at all, so you do not climb 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.730
 talked out or something 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:44.240
 and that is absolutely stress free so i 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.010
 often had a stretch of just under 500 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.480
 I had one nearly 500 kilometers 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.150
 average consumption of i think 7 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.330
 Of course, 2 liters were many 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.790
 highways while what a lot of gasoline deadline 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.040
 and water consumption is driving it upwards 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.620
 short distance so work path five 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.530
 kilometer short distance heavy under 10 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.170
 especially when it is cold 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.780
 especially if he is not warm then 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.930
 should be without end and there were 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.450
 Of course anyway, but otherwise music 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.490
 So far, say very satisfied with the car 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.070
 It's still really fun 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.390
 always great to enter and you 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:26.750
 to go somewhere long distance 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.350
 country roads absolutely cool there is in the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.200
 curve one can not complain at all 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.790
 which I did not want to say yet 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.710
 what have me a bit 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.850
 edited at the beginning what is that for a 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.860
 weird symbol 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.860
 well, you do not see any good now 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.350
 this symbol here under the 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.480
 time of day 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.390
 you can also see the driving program 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.820
 that you currently have in it as the only where 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.230
 really appears when you look at it 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.120
 is the cupra program? 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.520
 then the button lights otherwise 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.150
 No matter what you choose from the program 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.020
 did not light the button 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.550
 maybe it's for the one or the other 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.080
 others still interesting that I already 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.050
 always asked what is funny 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.320
 Display there it is now in the program 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.780
 Sport mode and that changes then 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.970
 accordingly with yes and then I finish 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.130
 times the video as enough talked 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.840
 if he really has any suggestions for me 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.450
 really, the ideas are starting to go away 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.950
 and I still need a bracket that 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.160
 you always have zero on a hundred sprints and 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.790
 so on must do or can writes 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.300
 including feedback very welcome thank you 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.300
 for watching
