what<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> knew<00:02:08.220> Stan<00:02:08.520> probably

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
what it is because we knew Stan probably

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
what it is because we knew Stan probably
that<00:02:09.149> 300<00:02:09.630> years<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.130> older<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that 300 years so the older it is the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.210 
that 300 years so the older it is the
more<00:02:12.120> rare<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.709> condition<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.830> course<00:02:14.069> is
