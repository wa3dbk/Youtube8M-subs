00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:12.900
 fast leader kim fun hot presents psp slim 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 versus nintendo ds lite hi friends i am 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.240
 fan hot and I hope they are fine as 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.759
 always good as it says in the title 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 this video I did to compare these 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.890
 two consoles first clarified that then 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 I will make a video about the psp-3000 versus 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.259
 dsi so do not say stupid things 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.630
 like for example fucking fagot now 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.340
 will go to the dsi will be better than the whore 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.280
 shit of esp because he will have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 music and video player in addition to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.379
 a 0.3 megapixel camera with the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 which I can throw photos of my ass and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.179
 show them to the monkey face first 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 I clarify that I do not have a ps but I have 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.949
 played ds games on pc besides that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.589
 it is assumed that in the pc the games of ds 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.219
 they have better graphics so 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.749
 Say you've never played ds games 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 first we start with the graphics 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.910
 well here compare a ds with a p esp 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's like comparing a wooden house with 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.950
 the white house of usa 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.890
 we know that the p esp has more graphics 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 I did play in my games like games 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.570
 for speed pro street and I was impressed 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 those tremendous graphics well I can not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 say the same about experience with 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 ps game on the pc I can tell you that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.980
 I could not play more than 20 minutes at a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 ps game if the game that I played the most 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.120
 It was call of duty 4 and the truth was 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 such bad graphics and a sound still 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.860
 worse that I did not understand anything or history 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 nor what they said to me always I was lost and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.119
 I did not know where I was pointing and my brain 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 I worked so hard to understand at least 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.150
 something that after 20 minutes hurt me 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.729
 head 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.010
 unlike the call of duty road to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.960
 victory of the psc that has some graphics 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.570
 as the call of duty 1 to the maximum 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.350
 details on the pc that fuck if you see 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.960
 Well, this is a point for the PSP 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.360
 now we will analyze good gameplay 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 according to many the one of that has better 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.040
 gameplay although I do not find him the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.770
 joke to be moving a stick in a 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.810
 little screen in clear games that if it is 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.269
 re good to chat but to play not 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.040
 I like it 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.890
 because people play big of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.859
 car 4 is for its playability or for its 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.019
 graphics good this is a point for 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.849
 both since not everyone likes to play 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.700
 with a stick as well as not all 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.510
 they like to play with buttons now 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.019
 multimedia the psp can play video 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.599
 in mp4 format music photos browse by 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.120
 internet although the browser is a bit 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.120
 slow listen radio you can install 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.859
 windows xp and vista has gps you can 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.560
 enter your email to 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.280
 chat and I can not think more things the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.959
 from that you can listen to music and videos 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.359
 but the problem is that it is not integrated 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.519
 you have to buy a card for 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.650
 that can reproduce them you can also 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.650
 Chat with the stick that is entertaining 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.780
 and several other things in this case is medium 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.819
 point for the ds by the card and a 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.220
 point for the psp since you can 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:17.069
 fill in porn xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.769
 now multiplayer in the p esp sometimes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.060
 it's exasperating to play in multiplayer and 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.010
 that sometimes the ps 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.709
 you can not find servers and you have to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.569
 create accounts for some games in the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.360
 that maybe it well but I think 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.900
 it is not so I give the point to ads 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.910
 and half a point to the p esp well we are three 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.840
 points and a half to two and a half points 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.930
 winning the p esp games the psp has 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.360
 very varied games for example the metal 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.640
 gear solid ' flatout e addon all 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.269
 need for speed 'medal of honor' mining 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.430
 club los angeles remix among others the one of 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.380
 that also has very good games like 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.640
 metroid prime unter new super mario 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.110
 mario kart ds nintendo c's among others 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.750
 Good is a point for both since 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.819
 They have games for all tastes 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.690
 now we are four and a half points to 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.849
 three and a half points earning the p esp 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.500
 originality here we know that the one about that 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.769
 It is the most original because it has two 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.489
 screens but that's not why the psc is ugly 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.410
 the point is for ds is tie four 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.580
 half points equal to see if 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.840
 tiebreaker we design good here the ps 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 psc and what 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.190
 very, very nice and the truth is 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.860
 very attractive while that of that is 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.930
 a rectangle without design we are five 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.930
 points and a half to four and a half points 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.940
 winning the psp fuck to see if I find 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.760
 something good about that so it does not stay 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.560
 so good down I found it and it is that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.330
 that one has an integrated microphone and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.790
 that helps you interact with some 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.250
 few games but he has it so a 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.940
 point for ds we are tied again 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.669
 five and a half points equal screen 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.040
 well that one has two screens one 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.630
 tactile and another normal the problem is that 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.669
 you can only focus on one 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.330
 screen and not in two unless you have 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.729
 four eyes xd xd xd xd xd while 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 the pspv a bigger screen what 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.810
 means that you can focus more on 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.270
 the game instead of worrying about what 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.350
 screen look is a point for p esp and 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.770
 medium for that and we conclude with 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.630
 good sales here this is how to compare 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.910
 the xbox with a ps2 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.130
 We all know that ps2 was sold more 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.930
 that the xbox even though the xbox has 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.300
 better graphics 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.100
 the ps2 they bought all kinds of 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.259
 people but the xbox bought it 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.050
 gamers looking for good graphics but 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.870
 clear the DS and PSP are different from the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.720
 that has been sold more but the p esp is 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.940
 most loved by all for example a 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.190
 person can take a ds to school 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.770
 and nobody looks at you but if you take a p esp 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:00.210
 you are surrounded by people xd xd 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.430
 xd xd xd xd good was like that six points 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.120
 and half for the psp and six points for 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.580
 ds so the psc wins but it depends on 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.380
 your tastes for example that one's more 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.229
 that nothing for children and people of the 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.509
 old age or old xd while 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.419
 that psp is more for teenagers and 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.639
 adults of the second age so follow 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.680
 your dreams and your tastes so if you 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.990
 like that one buy me but if you 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.160
 dream is that you are gay do not follow it xd xd 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.160
 xd xd xd xd up here this video friends 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:51.070
 [Music] 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.350
 to the devils in this house people are 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.150
 singing it is clear that this is not you 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.400
 rapper do not take off for the neighborhood 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.530
 neither do the miners know that I 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.760
 I am the exponent that puts in Havana and 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.760
 what is your current
