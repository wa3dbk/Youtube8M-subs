 not from this block of land but from the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.649
 mouse rate 5 2 at cyborg 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.440
 yes i ai so bought for Christmas so 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.219

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.899
 excuse me we see a little in the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.649
 reflection I'm going to shift I'm filming with 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.610
 my camera 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.670
 so if you show yourself so 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 the acquisition is a special mouse 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 gamer so with a precision shot towards 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 really and that that has grown 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 so it's a 560 countries so spite 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 I'll let you see them in the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 description I would put lots of little ones 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.710
 sites where you can find the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 definition of the power of this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.869
 mouse so so it's a cyborg and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.460
 so this is a mouse is special for 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.250
 video games and also for a few of the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.280
 little shooter games we are 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.220
 all like that so here's the mouse whose 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 crac 5 sorry we see where there is pavon 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 seems to see a little too much in the foot 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.390
 you 'll see a little bit so here's the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 surah 5 so I tried to stick myself 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 at best you have it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.460
 see better here so it's a mouse 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 special e special so gaming so I 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 so bought them at Leclerc at the price 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 about 70 euros so I do not 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.110
 do not open it now because it's for 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.290
 Christmas I will make you a video unpacking 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.600
 I will show you his abilities and everything 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.950
 So then 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.770
 if you want to see what this is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.290
 that a cibox mouse 5 so this is this 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.270
 so I do not worry I you 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.759
 will do a lot of videos show you his 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.250
 abilities and you then so as you 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.760
 can see it on this side of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.190
 this box 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.050
 so there is written cyborg rat of 5 with a 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.709
 little drawing a nice wine can 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.730
 see where it's a mouse species game 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 it's a cyborg mouse 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.590
 excuse me if I have the frame not very 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.340
 good but I have to adjust at the same time 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.230
 there the quality of the image we will say 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 try to be the most accurate so I 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.430
 follow me there I youngest is fast 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.040
 done on my TV next to these little ones 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.360
 Minecraft stuff 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.069
 so here is the mouse she has 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.840
 of Calais with leds 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.769
 as you can see hop there 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.980
 argue so there is right here is 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.900
 just on the side too so there are two 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.180
 three colors of the edge excuse me 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.330
 so there are 18 programmable commands 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.880
 on this mouse so by the user 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.380
 also thanks to six buttons including key 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.130
 programmable to community 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.140
 switches including four oppositions 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.140
 also a precision firing mode 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.569
 so the sensitivity setting is at 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.749
 will and 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.659
 on the other hand so yes shooting on simple 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:25.670
 touch of a button finally it is enough 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.579
 to press a button and then fire 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.599
 precision is really really increased 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.129
 then what we turn beautiful 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.510
 also an aluminum chassis of which 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.609
 many you excuse me I feel 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.889
 at the sides for you can we can 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.420
 see the box so on the rise y 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.269
 associating aluminum so all that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.950
 is enough aluminum so I give them 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.329
 advise I really recommend this 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.939
 I have already been able to test them at 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.200
 three pals was really going really 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.419
 not bad with precision 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.530
 it's true that next we think it 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.870
 smiles there is no better 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.329
 but there it is really there is not a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 single bug is nothing fine and it's really 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.150
 if there is more cable it an effect 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.639
 we do not assume to show you 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 I will open the box it is indeed 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.430
 carbon so as you can the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.500
 to see it's a pretty smile so there 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.000
 as I wanted 10 to 30 seconds on 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.560
 can adjust the the the name I'm not 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.379
 really said that but we can adjust the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.389
 position so if you have a rather 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.190
 big wrist or a smaller handful of 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.370
 you can change it 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.349
 so there a little cyborg mouse so 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.120
 So it also was therefore the chassis 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.650
 aluminum so robust but manageable 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.860
 so that's what I just said 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.060
 can we can modify it 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.409
 and so she has more resistance is 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.780
 it also makes some aluminum and 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.190
 metal so yes so the boutis buttons 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.419
 on the side so just that I was showing 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.699
 so I think I'll put the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.370
 box on the ground before you saw 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.270
 that I do everything to smash the mouth that I 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.280
 do everything to smash the mouth clichy 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.250
 manages it's french so the thin 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.349
 cyborg it's not complicated sutin head 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.720
 who looks like a cyborg gc quickly done 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.699
 to make you remonstrate so against 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.770
 we will not come to see but it is this cable 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.590
 so there you can not see well 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.300
 mans and so that's what 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.150
 oh there we see nothing at all ah 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.130
 here it is here so it is the mouse 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.510
 cyborg so can see the big wheel 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.540
 in the middle where we can 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.290
 change there the orders will say that he 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.880
 there are a dozen 18 buttons pred on 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.080
 program of course so that's really 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.400
 complicated so must also know a 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.100
 to have minimum in the mice 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.900
 keyboard everything then by cons I want 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.290
 also tell you that I bought a 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.820
 computer 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.260
 so I will not break my head at 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.960
 you describe it and where so if you want 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.070
 see the computer I got 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.170
 it's a the new the new ones 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.370
 excuse me you do not plan but 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.040
 it's a lenovo so I bought 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.290
 on the fnac and so if you want to see 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.320
 how they look like click on this 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.280
 little cube and yes they do not hesitate 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.350
 click on this little cube 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.790
 ok so I stop doing the con so 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.220
 So here is a little video enough 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.600
 sympathetic his sympathies that I you 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.610

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.940
 and but we find ourselves for the real 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.940
