motherboard box is not all that exciting

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.560 
motherboard box is not all that exciting
you<00:00:47.110> can<00:00:47.290> see<00:00:47.590> that<00:00:47.860> inside<00:00:48.460> there<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.270> the

beautiful shiny heat spreader of the
brand<00:00:52.000> new<00:00:52.090> processor<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.879> going<00:00:55.390> to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
brand new processor and I'm going to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.700 
brand new processor and I'm going to
take<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.719> out<00:00:55.809> now<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.110> there's<00:00:56.379> not<00:00:56.440> too<00:00:56.590> much

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710

else to look that out here it's your

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.049 
else to look that out here it's your
standard<00:00:58.420> Intel<00:00:59.100> box<00:01:00.100> but<00:01:00.520> I<00:01:00.550> also<00:01:00.730> wanted<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
standard Intel box but I also wanted to

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.119 
standard Intel box but I also wanted to
mention<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.449> real<00:01:01.690> quick<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.890> box

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
mention just real quick this is the box

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.859 
mention just real quick this is the box
from<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.340> 39<00:01:03.789> 70<00:01:04.239> x<00:01:04.390> which<00:01:04.570> i'm<00:01:04.690> currently

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
from the 39 70 x which i'm currently

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.240 
from the 39 70 x which i'm currently
using<00:01:05.080> i<00:01:05.379> just<00:01:05.590> thought<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.770> was<00:01:05.890> kind<00:01:06.039> of<00:01:06.130> cool

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
using i just thought it was kind of cool

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.830 
using i just thought it was kind of cool
that<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.490> was<00:01:06.610> black<00:01:06.910> it<00:01:07.149> kind<00:01:07.300> of<00:01:07.330> separated

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
that it was black it kind of separated

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.899 
that it was black it kind of separated
from<00:01:08.140> all<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.010> other<00:01:09.159> ones<00:01:09.369> since<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:09.700> one

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
from all the other ones since this one

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.830 
from all the other ones since this one
is<00:01:09.939> so<00:01:10.180> expensive<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.920> anyway<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:15.720> i'm<00:01:16.720> going

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
is so expensive but anyway so i'm going

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.899

this is you know more for the high-end
desktop<00:02:01.180> environment<00:02:02.020> rather<00:02:02.110> than<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.680> know

it's overclockable this is also very

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.670 
it's overclockable this is also very
similar<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.549> i<00:02:09.759> think<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.420> was<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.680> 2687

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
similar to a i think it was the 2687

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.910 
similar to a i think it was the 2687
version<00:02:12.370> 2<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:15.580> Zeon<00:02:16.349> 12<00:02:17.349> core<00:02:17.739> which

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
version 2 which is a Zeon 12 core which

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.180 
version 2 which is a Zeon 12 core which
they

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
they

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.790 
they
soldered<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.030> cores<00:02:19.270> off<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.810> her<00:02:20.590> this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
soldered for the cores off of her this

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
soldered for the cores off of her this
and<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.700> also<00:02:21.880> overclockable<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.900> that's

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and this is also overclockable so that's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.830 
and this is also overclockable so that's
why<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.620> highly<00:02:24.610> desired<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:25.420> folks

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
why it's so highly desired for folks

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.530 
why it's so highly desired for folks

you know the the socket mechanism itself
on<00:03:08.020> your<00:03:08.140> motherboard<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:08.980> gets<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.190> really

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
on your motherboard so it gets a really
