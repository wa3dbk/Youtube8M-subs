00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
Vader cutting down which I think is the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.910

coolest idea you know sort of bringing

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
coolest idea you know sort of bringing
out<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.490> movie<00:02:02.730> something<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.150> didn't

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
out of the movie something that didn't

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 
out of the movie something that didn't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
happen in the film and you'd apply as

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.180 
happen in the film and you'd apply as
Darth<00:02:05.850> Vader<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.840> couldn't<00:02:07.260> have<00:02:07.380> built<00:02:07.800> we

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Darth Vader it couldn't have built we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.910 
Darth Vader it couldn't have built we
just<00:02:08.460> weren't<00:02:08.760> there<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.420> exactly<00:02:09.920> it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
just weren't there to see exactly it's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.780 
just weren't there to see exactly it's
something<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.550> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.940> sidetrack

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
something that's kind of a sidetrack

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.960 
something that's kind of a sidetrack
it<00:02:14.299> takes<00:02:15.290> place<00:02:15.530> between<00:02:15.739> Episode<00:02:16.459> four<00:02:16.790> and

it takes place between Episode four and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.330 
it takes place between Episode four and
Episode<00:02:17.330> five<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.560> falls<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.129> line<00:02:19.280> with

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
Episode five so it falls in line with
