00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
do have some shots of the pc build so if

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.250 
do have some shots of the pc build so if
you<00:00:27.180> guys<00:00:27.420> want<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> go<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.840> check<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.140> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
high settings and for a 1080p resolution
we<00:01:47.909> had<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> result<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.810> 65<00:01:49.380> frames<00:01:49.740> per<00:01:49.920> second

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
we had a result of 65 frames per second

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.600 
we had a result of 65 frames per second
and<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.820> 1440p<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:52.290> also<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.710> 40<00:01:53.189> frames<00:01:53.369> per
