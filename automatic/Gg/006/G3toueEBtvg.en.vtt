00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm down, I'm in the trenches!

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.460
Oh my God... Phillips! NO!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.600
Ooooooh, suck my dick, you piece of shit!

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:17.200
FUCK

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.880
That's bullshit.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.200
Are you ready for some authentic paintball action from the number one name in the sport?!

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.700
GREG HASTINGS PAINTBALL 2!!!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.260
It's terrible!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.400
This shit's fuckin' state-of-the-art. Oh my God, is this Call of Duty 5?! This is crazy!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.200
MODERN WARFARE 7!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.200
Oh, just like fucking running in there. Oh, not stopping for anything!

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.400
I'm just walking down the middle of the fucking field!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.200
You suck!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.700
You suck! (x2)

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.200
You suck! (x3)

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.700
You suck! (x4)

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.200
You suck! (x5)

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
That guy really does suck.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.500
Look at this guy, look at this guy! You do this for a living, you piece of shit?!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700
[Game] You need to push up! Now!

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.000
Push up - I'm coming back at the flag, numbnuts!

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
This game does not fuck around, look at that old guy!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.320
LOOK AT HIM

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.400
[Old guy voice] Huuurh! Paintball!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.200
Whoa...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
IT'S LIKE FUCKING NORMANDY HERE!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.100
[Quietly] Wait, ready?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.100
OOHHH FUCKING CHEATED BITCH!!! Oooh, your face!

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.700
Kerry, shut up!

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.860
[Whispering] Are we still playing?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.180
AAAAGH

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.920
Oh wow, I just cheated. That's - a sign of a shitty game, and I died anyway, but that's fine.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.800
That's fine!

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640
[Game] Yeah, yeah! Awesome game!

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.140
YEAH YEAH BOYYYYYY

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.880
[Game] ...out on the field. A team that stays in communication will beat a quiet team nine times out of ten.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.880
Oh, shut up! No, it won't! I didn't say anything!

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.480
Wear brighter colours Philip Smith, I could barely fucking see you in the woods!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
Why is our team wearing bright white?!

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.640
Wur - should be wearing fucking camo!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.120
[Realising his fate] Goddammit!

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.780
[Repetitive clinging noise]

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.160
Hit the fucking pole some more, hit the pole some more.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.080
Fuck!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.680
Cheated, suck my dick.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.200
♫ Buh da buh ♫

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.620
NO

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.000
He's just standing there...

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.980
Wait, I...

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.080
What was the objective there? I'm confused.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.860
We lost to them. We lost to THAT fucking team that got playing with his fucking shoe!

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.580
[Game] Hey, tie up your shoes!

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.720
Hey, tie your shoes! Great fucking tip!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.520
Jesus Christ, fatso! Fuckin slow your roll! You want to breathe some more?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.780
[Heavy breathing]

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.280
I wasn't even doing anything...

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.840
Holy fuck, Mario played paintball?!

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.980
MAMMA MIA

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.240
Look at this guy, he's fucking playing Nightcrawlers over here!

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.480
Holy shit, the Frontline Paintball magazine?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.800
Paintball...

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.120
Paintball never changes...

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.800
[Game] ...aster of the woodsball world, so you know...

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.520
[Michael mocking game] sO yOU kNoW tHEy'Ll PuT oN a GreAT EVeNt tdHGghgHGHDrewesEHSHUT UP

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.440
Look at all the colours OOOOOOH it's like a fucking rainbow of flavour in my mouth!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.640
Hey, Philip!

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.120
Fuck you.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.320
[Weird voice] OOOOUUUH PHILIP YOU'RE GONNA BE AUH AUHH

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.340
Look at these guys, they're just walkin' through the middle of fucking field like jerk-offs.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.040
How is this hard? This is fucking retarded!

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.440
YOU SUCK

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.760
Dude, I'm pretty fucking amazing at this game.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.240
Paintball gaming doesn't get more realistic than this, unless you actually go outside and play paintball!

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.040
Why are we getting our ass kicked? Holy shit! No.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.380
Oooh, you're gonna die

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.880
you're gonna die (x2)

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.420
you're gonna die! (x3)

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.040
FUCK

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500
AHHHH CHEATED

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.440
Greg Hastings Paintball 2, it's almost like a real game if it were any fun!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.100
Oh, look at this! OH, fucking melee!

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.880
Cheat!

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.620
Cheat! (x2)

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.140
Shoot!

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.580
AAAH I GOT NO PAINT LEFT

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.660
AAAAH CHEATED AGAIN BUT I HAVE NO PAINT

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.720
I'm gonna hide.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.900
I'm raising Crimson Defense! Go!

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.540
OH

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.200
MY

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.700
GOD

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.940
I'M AMBIDEXTROUS

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.220
I've been running around with no paint for like five minutes. That guy's not gonna shoot me-

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.140
That guy shot me... -_-

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.760
♫ [Michael's guitar noise] Playing a shitty game ♫

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.060
♫ Gonna make it sound cool, It's fuck - ♫

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.440
♫ Include some rock music even though it's fuckin' terrible ♫

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.460
♫ And it's got graphics from like 1997 ♫

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.160
Dude, playing this... Like, I feel stupid. I had no idea they ported Rainbow Six from Nintendo 64 to 360.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440
Cuz that's what this looks like.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.540
No one in the office that made this game said,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.960
"Hey! What do you guys want to do after work?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.640
You want to play some Greg Hastings Paintball 2?"

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.609
Fuck no, they didn't! They would've played Halo or some shit, or Call of Duty!

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.040
NOBODY PLAYED THIS

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.840
Come here, you piece of shit!

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.820
GET OVER HERE

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.760
Fuck.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.280
OOOH cheated again!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.720
Hey dickfuck! Stand next to the fuckin' flag you're right next to and take it, you idiot!

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.500
Y O U  I D I O T

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.700
Alright yeah, we won. But nobody's a real winner because this game is fucking terrible.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.620
It's a piece of shit that should have never been made and quite frankly this week I'm not rage quitting it,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.340
I'm fucking pity quitting it!

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.020
I'm ashamed of myself for even playing this fucking horrible pile of crap.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.800
Quitting this fucking game!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.720
Gregory...

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.220
I am disappoint.
