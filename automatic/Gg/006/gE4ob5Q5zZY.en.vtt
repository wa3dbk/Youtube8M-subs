 curd has a simple formula than 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.260
 survival the less fatty foods you 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.140
 should use 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:30.100
 but also the case with Ivan, we use the most 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.100
 fat cottage cheese which is well and banana 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030
