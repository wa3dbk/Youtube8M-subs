want your heel of your blade just
slightly<00:03:08.660> off<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:08.959> ground<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.650> that's<00:03:10.010> going

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
slightly off the ground and that's going

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.740 
slightly off the ground and that's going
to<00:03:10.190> help<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.519> get<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> optimal<00:03:11.360> amount<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
to help you get the optimal amount of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.210 
to help you get the optimal amount of
flex<00:03:12.019> from<00:03:12.230> your<00:03:12.380> stick<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.800> if<00:03:12.860> you're<00:03:12.980> using

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
flex from your stick and if you're using

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.070 
flex from your stick and if you're using
that<00:03:13.519> flex<00:03:13.850> now<00:03:14.390> you're<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> be<00:03:14.900> able<00:03:14.959> to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
that flex now you're going to be able to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.800 
that flex now you're going to be able to
generate<00:03:16.010> even<00:03:16.070> more<00:03:16.459> power<00:03:16.730> with<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.420> proper

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
generate even more power with the proper

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.600 
generate even more power with the proper
technique<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.830> starting<00:03:19.220> off<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.459> have<00:03:19.580> a

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
technique so starting off we have a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.850 
technique so starting off we have a
quick<00:03:19.820> release<00:03:20.140> then<00:03:21.140> we're<00:03:21.560> generating

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
quick release then we're generating

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.530 
quick release then we're generating
power<00:03:22.220> by<00:03:22.550> using<00:03:22.580> our<00:03:22.940> hands<00:03:23.209> properly

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
power by using our hands properly

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.330 
power by using our hands properly
getting<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> hand<00:03:24.560> out<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:24.980> using<00:03:25.220> them

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
getting the hand out and using them

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.600 
getting the hand out and using them
together<00:03:25.489> then<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.450> last<00:03:26.660> thing<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.610> being

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
together then the last thing is being

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.040 
together then the last thing is being
able<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.850> generate<00:03:29.030> flex<00:03:29.510> by<00:03:29.660> having<00:03:29.959> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
able to generate flex by having that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.110 
able to generate flex by having that
puck<00:03:30.350> more<00:03:30.980> towards<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> toe<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.730> our<00:03:31.850> stick

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
puck more towards the toe of our stick

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.520 
puck more towards the toe of our stick
with<00:03:32.299> our<00:03:32.390> heels<00:03:32.600> slightly<00:03:32.780> off<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.290> ground

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
with our heels slightly off the ground

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.259 
with our heels slightly off the ground
okay<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.220> now<00:03:34.489> we<00:03:34.549> have<00:03:34.760> our<00:03:34.880> good<00:03:35.030> knee<00:03:35.239> bend

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
okay and now we have our good knee bend

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.850 
okay and now we have our good knee bend
and<00:03:35.600> we're<00:03:35.690> kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.019> leaning<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> shot

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
and we're kind of leaning into the shot

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.500 
and we're kind of leaning into the shot
okay<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:37.459> hands<00:03:37.700> out<00:03:37.880> we're<00:03:38.000> kind<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.239> leaning

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
okay so hands out we're kind of leaning

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.289 
okay so hands out we're kind of leaning
it<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:39.680> we're<00:03:39.860> releasing<00:03:40.160> okay<00:03:40.850> nice<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
it then we're releasing okay nice and

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.620 
it then we're releasing okay nice and
quick<00:03:42.190> okay<00:03:43.220> just<00:03:43.760> from<00:03:43.880> right<00:03:44.060> here<00:03:44.299> okay

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
quick okay just from right here okay

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.140 
quick okay just from right here okay
we're<00:03:44.810> not<00:03:44.900> bringing<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.380> back<00:03:48.790> okay<00:03:49.790> those

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
we're not bringing it back okay those

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.759 
we're not bringing it back okay those
are<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.330> three<00:03:50.600> main<00:03:50.780> tips<00:03:51.049> you're<00:03:51.470> getting<00:03:51.709> a

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
are the three main tips you're getting a

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.400 
are the three main tips you're getting a
quick<00:03:52.100> hard<00:03:52.760> snap<00:03:53.330> shot<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.870> you're<00:03:54.260> going<00:03:54.380> to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
quick hard snap shot and you're going to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.990 
quick hard snap shot and you're going to
become<00:03:54.709> Leath<00:03:54.950> with<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.400> shot<00:03:55.670> if<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.880> just

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
become Leath with that shot if you just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.699 
become Leath with that shot if you just
practice<00:03:56.239> these<00:03:56.600> over<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:56.959> over<00:03:57.049> again<00:03:57.260> but

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
practice these over and over again but

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.410 
practice these over and over again but
here's<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.040> thing<00:03:58.070> don't<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:59.030> take<00:03:59.209> your

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
here's the thing don't just take your

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.440 
here's the thing don't just take your
time<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.900> stick<00:04:00.410> handle<00:04:00.799> between<00:04:01.670> each<00:04:01.820> shot

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
time and stick handle between each shot

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.940
