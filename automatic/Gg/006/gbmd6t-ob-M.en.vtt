00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.019
 cangas kan since dry gray cangas no 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.630
 I like nothing I 'm sorry if I have the voice 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.690
 a bit strange is that yesterday I was 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 party and I'm a little hoarse good 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:25.970
 to begin let's see 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.369
 hebe is hebe 252 points in attack and you see 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.579
 252 points in speed and the 6 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
 remaining in ps as you can see in the image 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's worth saying that mega cangas kan is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.540
 prohibited in an individual is worth only 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.180
 can use in vgc doubles very well 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.210
 surprise movements that attack two 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 times for his filial love skill 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 retribution that you are also twice 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.270
 and is a normal type of attack is 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.550
 what a pity for happiness and it's amazing 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.620
 low blow to attack with priority and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.760
 that is not a very fast pokÃ©mon and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.549
 protection because they are double 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.439
 and we do not need another good attack it 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.790
 can put fist increment if you want 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.130
 put put increase and we raise the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.110
 attack in two as is well too 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.920
 but hey these are the attacks that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 they learn cangas can vale nature 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.770
 firm ability filial love of object the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.810
 cangas canita voucher filial love is that 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.909
 double but first the father and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.730
 after the son what hits he said is more 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.800
 weak but good 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.170
 and firm nature must be exploited at 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.820
 maximum your attack and now let's see the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 final statistics of cangas that have 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.930
 when it reaches level 100 and here 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.940
 we have the final mega statistics 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.830
 cangas kan when it reaches level 100 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 say first of all that the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.440
 previous movements that I have commented 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.440
 the low blow and surprise learns them by 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.410
 level and retribution and protection we 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.910
 learn by emt it's worth saying that 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.850
 let's start ps 352 is very good 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.150
 only to have put six points 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.740
 attack 317 how good is good but for 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.560
 there because mont with much more attack 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.600
 Obviously, how does it double? 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.020
 compensates 196 defense well this one stays 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.920
 just special attack 104 defense 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.600
 special 196 also fair and speed 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.020
 279 which is a standard speed that 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.030
 good luck some pokemon but today 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.080
 in day there are many because they are very fast 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.530
 a that is for example a we with because 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.390
 there is a very short 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.540
 says a son chronicler play in a 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.550
 hell that is a monkey is also a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.830
 infernal good side character 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.330
 It is also faster than you but good 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.420
 for that we put low blow to attack 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.340
 with priority we also have surprise and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.680
 It's a great because they do not make me gascan or 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 either this is forbidden in individual 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.550
 because it's a pass to people 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.950

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.790
