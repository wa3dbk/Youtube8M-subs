 matter of point of view the same thing 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 if you choose a point of view to tell 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 certain history can cause 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 people love a particular character or 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.120
 with people I rode around in a certain 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.530
 character that has lately done the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.239
 deconstruction of the villain and we are 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.559

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.120
 making in fairy tales 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 I was going on the story 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 started from the point that the villain had already 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 is put the child is doing right then I 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 I think I'm doing they're coming back. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 before the villain make the end of the count 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.549
 of portici and then they make 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.950
 happens before because it has become 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.869
 that son of a bitch from now on and 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.990

 The followers like to watch it, it's very cool. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.530
 and quite what they do is this 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.000
 humanize characters they explain the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.290
 story of the villain because he became 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.570

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.660
 In front of the daughter you and did the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.420
 Tell the fucking girl to flee. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.459
 with the poor fad cydia that the girl 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.680
 daughter told her mother mercenary and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.100
 See who's a virgin mercenary. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.970
 Tuesday the safe with the money there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.370
 Regina was mad causing vine Duco 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.290
 the goal of the waters to the serum and married 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.970
 In that fucking old baba on her was the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.310
 Ma'am, not for money, she was in love. 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.280
 by the fucking face regina without knowing how to deal 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.650
 with that oil that consumes it, they think 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.600
 she would never be happy in life and honor 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 but came back to be able to determine if the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.300
 madrid lamy 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 Now I'll tell you the thing 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.350
 character is so well written and also 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.470
 defends that the agreement with you does not 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.739
 noticed something disgraceful of the daughter of the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.190
 king was only the child in Haiti was only one 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.959
 naive girl of yours and rock defending that 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.019
 we think this is you okay there 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.209
 I also even defended tasting that 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.250
 is a boy with a merkel boy thought of 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.900
 jokes aside when you see the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.580
 character being very fused to our 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.590
 natural tendency to want to defend not 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.380
 will put on the lap take one stays like this no 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.180
 came and gone touch the house's food and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.120
 washed clothes taken advantage of everything 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.620
 Love and life teaches us not live 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.180
 it's more for villain, another's we are 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.580
 but for the whole girl the whole point is that the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.100
 villain he does not know what is the villain 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.630
 most times he gets himself victimized 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.590
 thinks he was the victim of an injustice 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.660
 he needs 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.040
 get revenge on dealing with it and 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.590
 He does not stop to think about what he has in 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.970
 around him so he is a human being who 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.349
 becomes selfish 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.970
 after what happened to him either 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.370
 to say a human being I'm not talking about 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.099
 character but the same thing happens to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.049
 If life comes on then you take care 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.330
 by striking it this is cinderella in the 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.519
 truth by her stepmother in pressure tension 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.290
 I love the villains I think the villain is 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.360
 much denser much closer to the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.310
 human being is a very linear 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.459
 most often the cinderella 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.829
 must to what will be given by rossi of her is nothing 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.930
 if it was her story 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.880
 understood to have a date to generate a 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.459
 conflict there understood peace force account 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.500
 series of them only in the butt and cinderella not 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.700
 make history alone even when 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.169
 she was little my mother was very 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.820
 worried about me because I just liked 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.680
 of Finland is a little mermaid by 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.530
 I hoped example to me what account 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.419
 The truth is that I really wanted to 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.539
 child wanted to tap it that it is ready to 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.340
 webjet and with tea ursula wisely said 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.940
 What is life full of choices? 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.960
 difficult is not for the woman 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 I even think I should do 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.169
 that can co 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.910
 including I think I should do that 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.280
 nor malevolent to create the one witch movie 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.440
 solo in a way, her story every time 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.260
 who gets the decision a lot to do this 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.970
 even so, Sergio needed a lot if he did not 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.510
 I want to do it, I think this 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.280
