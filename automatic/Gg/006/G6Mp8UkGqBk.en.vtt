00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 with oneself in which you have to 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.069
 even accentuate 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.379
 fifteen grams of flour 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.589
 fifteen grams 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.480
 cl 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.430
 in music for mornay sauce 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.279
 fifteen grams 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 grated cheese 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 to melt the butter 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.080
 6 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.780
 so with a loan of a season 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 after 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.800
 so do not let color of course 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.830
 six posts that were en route blue 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.130
 stronach that arise scientists and other currencies 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.560
 their bet 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.180
 justice is this concept because it seems difficult to master 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 she has to have for her to say tusk the decline should be more 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.660
 slow 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.700
 distance 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.170
 you put your heads while the head for her why not believe 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.640
 it will save you 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.800
 to have big words 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.340
 in an element when you do 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 it's already Christmas you have to go ahead or 3 more than during 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 parties this time 3 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 jean-jacques lasserre 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 we are therefore 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 that's enough to make skeptical 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.960
 the mystery 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 not one thing that you can also put 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980
 instead of music 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 it's the busy a mystery called 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 starting face to face with what I am but his strategy 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.539
 so the good breakaway to four 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.619
 this species 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.229
 this 7 m 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.259
 so 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.769
 for mornay sauce 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.169
 you take 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.379
 fifteen grams 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.949
 grated cheese 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.389
 that you put in 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.929
 so at that time 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.219
 the name 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.199
 exchange 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.339
 it's no more 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.169
 a 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.129
 deschanel 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.759
 It's a thing 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:48.299
 so the pomponnette screenshot it flat and especially more au gratin what is 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.560
 besides a coloring 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.069
 so for lasagna 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.959
 it has to be
