[Static SFX]

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.220
[♪♪♪] 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.700
Hi! My name is James. Welcome back to another
episode of Hard Hat Chronicles.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
There are many exciting activities going on
on the Thunderbird construction site.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.180
One of them which you can see behind me is
what we call “pilot car checks.” 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.560
You can see we took the first two cars from the Thunderbird train and transferred it onto the track.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.460
As we move these two cars around the track we can make sure that all of the critical dimensions are correct.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.900
One of these dimensions and tolerances we’re checking is with the stators of the launch. By checking the stators,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.660
 we can make sure that the launch to 60 miles an hour in just 3.5 seconds will work correctly.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.020
Where the two cars are located behind me is
the very end of the launch track.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.960
At this point the train will be going 60 miles an hour.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.100
Gravity takes over from here as the car ascends to the top of the 140-foot-tall first inversion.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
Today, we’re going to take you inside the
control building for Thunderbird.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.760
Or, as we like to call it, the Will Power building.
Come on, let’s go take a look!

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120
When you have a ride as advanced as Thunderbird,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.560
 there’s an intricate control system to make everything happen.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.920
I like to break it down into three sections to understand how it all works.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.000
First, is ride control and that’s out of these cabinets on my left. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.180
Second is launch control. All these cabinets on my right are dedicated to launching the train down the track 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.660
up to 60 miles an hour.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.740
Finally, there’s flywheel control. Those controls are actually in a different room of the Will Power building

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.960
where we’ll head next.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.260
You may recognize this room from a previous episode of Hard Hat Chronicles

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.200
if you’ve been following along on the website. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.000
In this room, there’s the flywheels themselves, and all the support equipment necessary to make them run.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.270
The flywheel assembly consists of three main parts: those parts are a motor, a generator

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.190
and then the flywheel itself.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.010
The way the system works is,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.640
in between launches of Thunderbird,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.000
the motor spins the flywheel up to speed.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360
This stores energy that can later be used for the launch.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.720
When it’s time for Thunderbird to launch,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.890
that flywheel transfers the energy to the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.540
generator which converts that energy into electricity

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.960
and powers the stators on the launch track.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240
That’s it for this episode of Hard Hat Chronicles.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.780
