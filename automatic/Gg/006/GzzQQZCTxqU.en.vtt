 but 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.020
 radical entertainment managed to position 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.470

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.520
 we empathize with their cause 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.220
 accompanying him throughout his strange 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:44.540
 evolution as a mutant and his crusade 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:46.160
 particular against people to get us to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.070
 day we have the option to watch a video 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.230
 summary of the first game but altered 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 it is explained from the tourism of 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.200
 the black watch the armed power that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 defends the feels that we believed that the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.100
 virus had killed him we were wrong 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.530
 transformers and I give him skills 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.420
 superhuman radical offers a second 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 delivery that still being quite 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.430
 continuist presents improvements and changes 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.880
 substantial among them a new 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.680
 protagonist sergeant james heller 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.530
 who wants to avenge the death of his 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.000
 wife and daughter killing the one who is the only 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.320
 guilty alex mercer but nothing is what 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 It seems 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.170
 I do not free on virus 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.780
 and I killed your wife and your son 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.200
 so what do you want 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.000
 in front of them I want to destroy them 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.270
 from this encounter our body 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.670
 will start to mutate by getting strangers 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.070
 destructive powers but the hardest 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.280
 will be discovering the truth about the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.560
 experiments of people that we will doubt 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 even about the perverse idea that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.210
 we have to see being persecuted 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.430
 for the black watch and people we 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 we will almost become the new enemy 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.829
 public number one 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 the change made of protagonist 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.509
 just like the player since the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.970
 first bars of play a story 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.450
 much better is going nothing and complex motivates 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.670
 power and justifies this change new 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 york ' ciro the area of ​​the game by which 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.290
 we will move is divided into several 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.090
 zones or districts and in these they will go 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.400
 presenting the main missions and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500
 secondary we also have the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.970
 possibility to search and recover all 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.340
 the black boxes of each of the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.569
 districts will absorb characters that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.310
 they make stronger 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.769
 and that give us the key to access 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.930
 to additional information eliminate the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.380
 test areas ready to use civil 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.390
 like guinea pigs etc. we have a lot 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.700
 greater offer of chores than in the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.069
 first delivery in some missions 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.319
 We will also have additional goals 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.230
 how to absorb a certain enemy alive 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.400
 delete or capture x objective of certain 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.590
 way etcetera 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.840
 heller can move freely 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.420
 throughout the city which shows 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.310
 enough life in its streets marked by 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.230
 the omnipresent surveillance of 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.299
 soldiers trucks and helicopters of the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.430
 forces of the uach 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.799
 we will start using only our fists and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.019
 kicking energetically but soon 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.329
 we will start to have claws tentacles and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.879
 other mutant powers that we can go 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.349
 improve we will also improve the 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.150
 attitudes of our character 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.120
 such as faster recovery 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.609
 improve the sprint and so on 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.099
 heller will show all his power without 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.310
 repairs and the greater the degree of 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.040
 alert more enemy presence we will have 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 including assault troops everywhere 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.970
 ram the enemies be soldiers or 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.400
 vehicles allows us to inflict greater 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.829
 damage to the enemy we will recover life 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.799
 absorbing any human taking their 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.470
 appearance and weapons this will be perfect 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.570
 to mislead the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.430
 the gameplay we liked a lot more than 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.950
 the original proto time with a control 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.660
 that offers great possibilities although 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 the distribution of the buttons has not 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.160
 convinced one hundred percent jump from 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.900
 roof on roof plan to run for the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.120
 walls and above all annihilate the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.580
 enemy as we want using stealth 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.090
 It grants a lot of variety in its depth 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.430
 of game 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.799
 the missions present a good 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.260
 variety of situations all of them with 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.150
 a difficulty well adjusted only 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.860
 specific moments we have had some 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.990
 problem with the point of view of the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.090
 camera 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.419
 as the first game lacks 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.910
 multiplayer but you do not need 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.639
 the more and better in all senses 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.710
 applies perfectly in prototype 2 and 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.180
 this can not be missing between the games of 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.180
 action of our played teak
