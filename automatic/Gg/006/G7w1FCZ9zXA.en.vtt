00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.290
 youtube people once again we are 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.780
 here new video 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.790
 new gloves as you will have seen in 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.160
 the title of this video 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.840
 but well let's start as you can 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.110
 see these gloves I bought them in the 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.060
 martÃ­ store 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.310
 one of the few Mexican stores that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.470
 they have a little variety 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.390
 and finally 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.900
 of the situations that buy these 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.370
 Gloves were in discount at their price 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.130
 original 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.390
 as we can see 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.480
 its original price was 999 pesos 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.489
 here as you can see but I the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.530
 I understand a 50 percent offer 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.739
 plus 20 extra with what it cost me 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.040
 400 pesos even much cheaper than 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.780
 a chamber pot even with the reus 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.030
 but good this model rosita 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.050
 I liked it a lot, it 's very particular, it's almost 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 of the last thing that came out 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.440
 but well let's see in main here 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.680
 this label presents us the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.230
 features that these gloves have 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.900
 you know about his grip 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.150
 this what all of the others are 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.510
 rolled with latex good not all 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.690
 and the ventilation system but good 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.659
 let's start the nike sachets that 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.909
 I like them because they are closing 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.409
 compared to a good queen the 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.409
 Queen also some are closing but 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.920
 it's just the top part 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.870
 they are easier because they are 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.360
 open rather then open all 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.280
 as you can see it gave me a chance to 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.510
 Take them to customize with my 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.510
 initials soccer 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 and here we have them 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.119
 now we go with the other 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.840
 so more wrapped in this little bag and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.610
 come with a booklet these booklets 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.610
 they come in many languages 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.739
 and come some recommendations from the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.930
 gloves how to use them how to wash them 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.330
 even and what are they for, we already know that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.800
 They are gloves to carry around here 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.500
 they say it does not work for us 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.550
 assumptions for obvious reasons 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.990
 but good 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.960
 here we have them I'm going for grip 3 a 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.820
 difference from other baseball like the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.820
 color that came out 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 but they also came out in this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.390
 color for vpo grip types grip 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.050
 this color had as a ventilation 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.030
 in this part of these two fingers to what 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.400
 that these have already been removed 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.290
 and honestly I liked it very much that 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.319
 I had that because I felt they are a little 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.260
 more exquisite your fingers good here 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.880
 we can see something that characterizes 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.940
 characterizes a lot these gloves that are 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.510
 the fingers wrapped in the latex and it's 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.780
 as to have a better grip of the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.780
 ball 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.860
 the latex I think that this one has a thickness 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.530
 of 4 millimeters but this is a latex 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.800
 German the contact like here we do not 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 specific 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.860
 and good the brooch is not him 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.760
 is one of the ones that I like the most because 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.680
 which has like four parts for no more 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.280
 ok 3 2 and 3 here we have a 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.870
 2 and 3 and I like this a lot because it 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.209
 adjusts more the glove instead some 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.200
 nothing more broaches have like that in this 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.510
 part and does not fasten you well even up 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.350
 then you get to unbutton and that's 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.960
 very uncomfortable at the time of matches 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.360
 and you see also what I like is the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:08.370
 time to put on the glove because look 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.299
 so simple good or so simple 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.159
 Hold Walter to this and I have them 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.160
 posts compared for example 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.590
 the predator finger shape 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.680
 I had previously uploaded video in 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.600
 the part here is very complicated 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.700
 because it 's a little bit smaller spring and 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.740
 then it's hard for you to put on 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.230
 instead, you put them in a 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.220
 little while 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.220
 as I said 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.050
 are here 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.540
 and they were for me this glove is very 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.940
 recommended since it is very much like 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.950
 that is very comfortable this one has very good 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.900
 grip with the ball 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.070
 this 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.410
 and well, here I leave all the video 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.350
 I hope you liked a boxing 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.270
 after many people told me paco 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.729
 when the video comes up when paco 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.039
 have the time that you do not upload video but 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.930
 well here I leave you I hope that you 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.180
 I liked you already know I leave my account 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.350

 often and also comment if I got to 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.790
 Missing something if you have these gloves 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.440
 publish what are good for 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.260
 you are bad if you have some 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.700
 negative points but good I am few 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.080
 and be here I hope you liked it 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.080
