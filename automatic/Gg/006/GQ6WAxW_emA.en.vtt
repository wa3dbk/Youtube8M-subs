that's<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.380> throwing<00:00:10.800> green<00:00:11.040> look<00:00:11.250> yet<00:00:11.460> easy

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
that's a throwing green look yet easy

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.360 
that's a throwing green look yet easy
throat<00:00:12.330> he<00:00:13.019> comes<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.500> put<00:00:13.710> pressure<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.190> him

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
throat he comes to put pressure on him

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.189 
throat he comes to put pressure on him
it's<00:00:14.490> too<00:00:14.700> late<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.420> then<00:00:15.570> when<00:00:15.719> he<00:00:15.780> gets<00:00:15.990> they

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199

doesn't<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.710> enough<00:00:16.830> Luiz<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.490> then<00:00:18.000> John

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
doesn't do enough Luiz and then John

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.939 
doesn't do enough Luiz and then John
Terry<00:00:18.630> gets<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> second<00:00:19.380> bite<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> he

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
what they did on the halfway line and it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
what they did on the halfway line and it
wasn't<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> great<00:00:52.559> pass<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:53.399> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
wasn't the great pass into mean or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
wasn't the great pass into mean or
Fernandina<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.449> horrific<00:00:54.840> fairly

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Fernandina but horrific fairly

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
Fernandina but horrific fairly
immediately<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.340> watches<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.969> touch<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
immediately just watches first touch it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.959 
immediately just watches first touch it
because<00:00:58.379> he<00:00:58.500> has<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> stretch<00:00:59.609> her<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
because he has to stretch her it a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
because he has to stretch her it a
little<00:01:00.120> bit<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> great<00:01:01.590> first

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
little bit there and it's a great first

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
little bit there and it's a great first
touch<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.370> even<00:01:02.609> better<00:01:02.820> finish<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.449> think

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
touch an even better finish I just think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
touch an even better finish I just think
I<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.260> makes<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.650> easy<00:01:04.920> there

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I don't know it makes it easy there

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
I don't know it makes it easy there
because<00:01:05.640> David<00:01:06.420> Luiz<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:07.140> actually<00:01:07.890> getting

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
because David Luiz is actually getting

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.840 
because David Luiz is actually getting
back<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
back in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
back in
but<00:01:09.479> John<00:01:09.930> Terry<00:01:10.200> comes<00:01:10.560> over<00:01:10.860> far<00:01:11.400> too

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
but John Terry comes over far too

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
but John Terry comes over far too
quickly<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.840> he<00:01:12.960> makes<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> mind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
quickly and he makes the mind of the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
quickly and he makes the mind of the
player<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.220> possession<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.909> ball<00:01:15.090> William

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
player in possession the ball William

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.140 
player in possession the ball William
wasn't<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> release<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.830> pass<00:01:17.150> but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
wasn't it to it to release the pass but

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.340 
wasn't it to it to release the pass but
what<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> distinction<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
what if there was a distinction and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
what if there was a distinction and
unnerving<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.580> should<00:01:20.729> have

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
unnerving I think he just should have

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
unnerving I think he just should have
held<00:01:21.060> his<00:01:21.210> position<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.900> give<00:01:22.320> David<00:01:22.740> Luiz<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
held his position to give David Luiz the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
held his position to give David Luiz the
champs<00:01:23.700> he<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.180> coming<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.900> buy-in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
champs he was coming back in buy-in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
champs he was coming back in buy-in
going<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.250> tight<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.939> he<00:01:26.970> did<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.659> ball<00:01:27.930> he

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
going as tight as he did to the ball he
