00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.120
 our channel fierce leo and today 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.790
 we deal with one again 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.220
 beginner trick and that the male that 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.380
 MÃ¤nnchen is one of the upper classics 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.330
 among the 100 tricks and is too 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.300
 actually extremely easy to learn and 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.980
 it just looks super cool yes that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.260
 Girls can actually every dog 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.890
 learn whether very small or very 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.500
 big and everything your dog can do 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.830
 it really has to sit that makes it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.589
 whole easier we catch it 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.420
 So with a sitting dog and 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.580
 support him first and indeed with 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.559
 our hands the dog is at the beginning 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.290
 a bit more balance ability 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.170
 and depending on how big or how 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.790
 talented your dog is you 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.909
 good, of course, also heavier or 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.589
 easier to keep this balance and 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.339
 That's why we support him in the beginning 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.100
 with the hands 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.409
 by simply putting it on 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.810
 our hands then we do so in 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.400
 Just let this form rise 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.240
 with his folks and then we leave 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.120
 hold him to it, so to speak 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.190
 and yes that's the dog's first step 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.260
 just possible though he has this balance 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.750
 not yet has so slow this movement 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.300
 to learn and over time 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.420
 Let's just try these hands 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.460
 further away 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.220
 In addition, the dog learns so already 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.280
 this hand movement this hand 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.460
 rich as a gesture with him 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 connects this trick and this gesture 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.540
 then we try as I said in the run 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.990
 to reduce the time and then 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.020
 additionally with time then always 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.080
 continue to shape the word people to do so 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.490
 that is as I said a pure question of 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.659
 time and will be your dog then too 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.120
 someday you just have to understand 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.120
 just stay tuned but the most important thing is 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.260
 as always the beginning 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.260
 and let you go now 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:32.860
 people were filled with people 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:32.860
 Munich with Munich with 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.310

 yes I hope you understood now 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 what I mean 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.490
 As I said, it is easy for everyone 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.680
 dog can learn and that's 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.200
 really simple trick that always looks 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.940
 cool again especially with big ones 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.230
 dogs i love that over all if that 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.860
 lola that just makes that look 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.330
 mighty if this is quite big 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.830
 sluggish and then people begin 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.220
 That's just a nice thing 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.730
 and that's really fun too 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.850

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.650
