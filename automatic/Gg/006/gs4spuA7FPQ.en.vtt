00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.649
 Haslauer at the new money instant Webmagazine which so far not as usual 

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:21.669
 from the study of lowers but here from the North Hall in Buxtehude 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.749
 if the sector of the Thuringian Buxtehuder SV as a very intense fight around 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.430
 the best starting position 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.260
 for the final second leg in the next week in the Salzahalle in Bad 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.890
 Langensalza have delivered 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 because he has doubts in case we now have a new offer in detail 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.010
 report 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 A better word is that you are women of the BSV 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.300
 and rightly its scapegoat since the Bible 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 the medical department always sweat at least as much 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.900
 Girls on the record who really do not give anything at all and who 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.050
 Error of the opponent immediately punished 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.340
 Against a backdrop of a thousand 600 spectators, the CRC caught something 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.740
 better start and was in the eighth minute with 5 to 3 4 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.100
 Kerstin Wohlbold can give her first two minutes for this foul 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 BSV could use for 4 2 5 1 2 1 for itself 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 Shortly thereafter, Steffen Mell was able to compensate for departure by seven-meter 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.280
 at all it has that in Mannheim so he has desire for the diocese with eleven 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 Most goals scored for BVB 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.650
 she was instrumental in ensuring that the TSV did not equal until the break 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.690
 a goal in front 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.660
 but that he could not settle any further could not be enough 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.020
 technical errors 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.530
 by Cindy write 14 possible 18 600 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.590
 so the halftime score of 14 10 for 10 was absolutely fair 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.370
 the second 30 minutes started as strong as first 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.880
 nice combinations did not always lead to a goal times though 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.360
 nevertheless the strength of the two teams 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.550
 everything remained open until the 38th minute 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.670
 but then finally meet up for this from then on Justin's third 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 time penalty 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.880
 The playmaker of the CRC then had to leave the field 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.420
 with the TV Stammheim open for all doors 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 it followed the second phase of the game 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.259
 but with the Buxtehuderinnen more and more mistakes crept in 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.659
 Although Steffi Melbeck drew a seven-meter but so was allowed and Easy 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.759
 Klein could not use her chance a few minutes later 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.049
 Tip 9 13 40 Watch a buggy with three simple matches in team play 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.749
 but it did not help the Erfurt woman stood up and played 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.989
 their individual class 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.859
 for Maike March the next season in Thuringia 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.209
 Petra can place 6th and showed many great parades 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.510
 Katrin Engel and again Wienerberger it goes off to help 8 goals 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.709
 The most successful launcher of their teams acted again and again 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.709
 decisive hits 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.699
 N / A 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.699
 Rostock dapd 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.699
 Norderstedt neighbors 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.479
 and the role of Kerstin Wohlbold took over now had to learn 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.310
 her teammates set 10 days without major problems 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:08.039
 the CFC Genoa second, even with six goals lead here at 26 32 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.699
 And although the Buxtehuder Anderson has the game now slow in markets 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.299
 they could even come up to four goals to fight the game again 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.229
 but was now decided yet gave the Buxtehuderin view not on 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.449
 graces three more hits 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.069
 the last of them Steffi Melbeck by seven meters to 29 to 4 3 5-endstand 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.109
 Nat 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.769
 then we just have to get out of the lead and she just has to do more for 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.489
 give our work more 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.709
 that's why we're going to be making too many technical mistakes like that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.639
 may 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.169
 between the 45 55 or not weak phase of coverage Boris Becker 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.859
 Sequences or gone out because of the TRC backspace throwers in 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.969
 and, of course, the two seven-meter meters were also discarded 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.869
 aap against such a strong teams sticking point 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.209
 all money 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.539
 instead of 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.539
 the whitepaper one on 8 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.299
 Georg Pollert but it remains strong no 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.779
 all previous finals 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.089
 of course, the Arsenal 10 did not make it a word 

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:29.939
 another format but if the team come from Belgium that will be rioters 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.529
 "This is again targeting the first impression one or the other 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.740
 Great game made on imports 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.889
 but I like to leave an eye on it for us it is 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.370
 always very hard against such strong backplayer a defense 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.849
 Although can 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.570
 You had to be very careful every second 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.540
 but I think our advantage Bolt was just that we have an answer to everything 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.539
 got to 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.159
 also this critical situation as in the crew Gerd nato troupe is 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.999
 Hartnett Angeles makes the Pearl van der Wissel a very good radio drama 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.089
 did a game he threw in front of the doors in their own way very well 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:06.750
 has chosen and a special praise music today's like Alitalia Borges Mesquita 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.869
 The band break out of every path in the books though they break out 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:13.999
 but due to the weather last two tournaments I'm glad and that 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.309
 was the difference today we have the right answer at the right moment yes 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:22.479
 we need to think about how we can play more effectively and how we can play 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.699
 we turn off our error rate 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.050
 and I expect that my team and I am convinced of them 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.949
 that will do 60 minutes in the 10 percent we try to face 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.129
 offer and that 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.129
 same militant element bring along like today 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.330
 that's halftime 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.120
 and we want to see that in the end we pull the team back to that 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.490
 ominous word that never works in the mouth we can then celebrate 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.880
 after an impressive final phase, the Thuringian HC tore so well 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.120
 five goals from Lausanne the second leg in his home hall next 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.780
 Saturday 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.230
 So best cards for the first time in club history the championship title 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.680
 Also win in the clergy game between the SV goes cell and the TV 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.030
 Nellingen could prevail the alleged favorite Zeller had 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.830
 away with 34 to 30 won straight on best chances in the second leg on 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.660
 next weekend in Zell the rise to make clear the results of 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.060
 According to the second play-off on the nylon boots, we will 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.070
 which now just show up in post production, we'll see each other 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.250
 again in the coming week until then all the best she is
