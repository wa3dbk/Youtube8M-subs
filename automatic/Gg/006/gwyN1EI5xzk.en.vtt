power<00:00:10.230> system<00:00:10.969> now<00:00:11.969> first<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.139> want<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.880> clarify

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
power system now first I want to clarify

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
power system now first I want to clarify
that<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.870> will<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.830> work<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.940> three<00:00:18.449> point

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that this will not work in three point

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.560 
that this will not work in three point
seven<00:00:19.380> point<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:20.330> it's<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.779> yet<00:00:22.189> but

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
seven point one it's not there yet but

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.299 
seven point one it's not there yet but
it<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.980> next<00:00:26.279> version<00:00:28.519> anyways

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
it will be in the next version anyways

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
it will be in the next version anyways
what<00:00:32.309> we're<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> cover<00:00:32.910> today<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.690> how

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
what we're going to cover today is how

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.540 
what we're going to cover today is how
to<00:00:35.750> set<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:37.020> engines<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.129> cannot

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
to set up your engines so they cannot

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.700 
to set up your engines so they cannot
explode<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.980> respond<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
explode and so that they can respond to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
explode and so that they can respond to
power<00:00:44.270> demands<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:46.079> needed<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.899> basically

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
power demands as needed so basically

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
power demands as needed so basically
what<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.930> each<00:00:55.170> engine<00:00:55.649> has<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
what we have here is each engine has a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.510 
what we have here is each engine has a
gate<00:00:56.899> just<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.500> controls<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
gate just one actually controls all of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
gate just one actually controls all of
them<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.760> we'll<00:01:03.390> we'll<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.930> doing<00:01:04.140> working

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
them but we'll we'll be doing working

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
them but we'll we'll be doing working
with<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.820> at

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
with this one as you can see it's off at

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450 
with this one as you can see it's off at
the<00:01:06.150> moment<00:01:06.479> there's<00:01:07.260> no<00:01:07.500> power<00:01:07.710> being<00:01:08.159> sent

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the moment there's no power being sent

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
the moment there's no power being sent
to<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.500> now

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to it now

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.510 
to it now
to<00:01:10.979> start<00:01:11.280> we'll<00:01:11.900> look<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.500> gate<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:15.060> have

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
to start we'll look at the gate we have

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
to start we'll look at the gate we have
three<00:01:17.520> triggers<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.960> first<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
three triggers the first one this is a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300 
three triggers the first one this is a
new<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.750> not<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.619> point<00:01:22.890> seven<00:01:23.159> point

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
new one not in three point seven point

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.260 
new one not in three point seven point
one<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> power<00:01:24.840> requested<00:01:25.590> trigger<00:01:26.270> which

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
one is the power requested trigger which

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
one is the power requested trigger which
is<00:01:28.020> true<00:01:28.920> whenever<00:01:29.659> their<00:01:30.659> network<00:01:31.590> needs

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is true whenever their network needs

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.660 
is true whenever their network needs
power<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> particular<00:01:33.420> wooden<00:01:34.020> pipe

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
power from this particular wooden pipe

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
power from this particular wooden pipe
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.700> only<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.210> placed<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.750> wooden<00:01:37.020> pipes

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can only be placed on wooden pipes

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.300 
you can only be placed on wooden pipes
no<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.100> pipes<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:39.049> this<00:01:40.049> power<00:01:40.680> requested

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
no other pipes just this power requested

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.929 
no other pipes just this power requested
trigger<00:01:42.710> then<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
trigger then this is the one that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.520 
trigger then this is the one that
controls<00:01:46.549> demand<00:01:48.649> from<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> system<00:01:50.930> now<00:01:51.930> here

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
controls demand from the system now here

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.410 
controls demand from the system now here
we<00:01:54.190> have<00:01:55.770> an<00:01:56.770> engine<00:01:57.430> read<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.090> engines

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
we have an engine read if the engines

one's<00:02:20.440> got<00:02:20.650> different<00:02:21.190> actions<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.210> it's<00:02:22.390> not

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
one's got different actions so it's not

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.960 
one's got different actions so it's not

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
part of the this first conditional here

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.790 
part of the this first conditional here
so<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.810> occasionally<00:02:32.380> comes

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
so as you can see it occasionally comes

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.220 
so as you can see it occasionally comes
on<00:02:33.010> whenever<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.970> system<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:36.209> put<00:02:37.230> even

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
on whenever the system I put even

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.940 
on whenever the system I put even
smaller<00:02:38.590> pipe<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.130> here

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.930 

that<00:02:46.580> should<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.270> smallest<00:02:47.390> pipe<00:02:48.940> 8:8

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
that should be the smallest pipe 8:8

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.680 
that should be the smallest pipe 8:8
megajoules<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:51.940> most<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.120> these<00:02:53.239> engines

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
megajoules and most of these engines

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.710 
megajoules and most of these engines
should<00:02:54.019> turn<00:02:54.319> off<00:02:54.530> eventually<00:02:58.330> see<00:02:59.330> there

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
should turn off eventually see there

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.970 
should turn off eventually see there
they<00:02:59.900> go

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.089 

that<00:03:04.519> one<00:03:04.700> appears<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.239> be<00:03:05.680> have<00:03:06.680> room<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.010> the

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
that one appears to be have room in the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.280 
that one appears to be have room in the
buffers<00:03:07.430> though<00:03:07.690> they'll<00:03:08.690> turn<00:03:08.840> off<00:03:08.989> there

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
buffers though they'll turn off there

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.150 
buffers though they'll turn off there
goes<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.849> we<00:03:11.750> only<00:03:11.959> got<00:03:12.170> one<00:03:12.230> engine<00:03:12.799> running

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
goes so we only got one engine running

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.400 
goes so we only got one engine running
now<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.239> here<00:03:14.510> will<00:03:14.690> probably<00:03:15.200> come

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
now and this one here will probably come

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.059 
now and this one here will probably come
on<00:03:15.560> occasionally<00:03:17.200> yes<00:03:18.200> he's<00:03:18.530> engines<00:03:18.890> output

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
on occasionally yes he's engines output

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.729 
on occasionally yes he's engines output
six<00:03:19.519> mega<00:03:19.760> joules<00:03:20.060> which<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.810> not<00:03:21.500> quite

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
six mega joules which is not quite

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.610 
six mega joules which is not quite
enough<00:03:21.920> for<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.250> pipe<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.870> one<00:03:24.110> here<00:03:24.470> so

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
enough for this pipe so this one here so

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.270 
enough for this pipe so this one here so
you<00:03:24.799> just<00:03:25.040> turned<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.870> however<00:03:27.250> because<00:03:28.250> of

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
you just turned on however because of

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.539 
you just turned on however because of
the<00:03:28.489> cooldown<00:03:28.849> timer<00:03:29.329> on<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.620> combustion

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
the cooldown timer on the combustion

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.100 
the cooldown timer on the combustion
engines<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:33.829> will<00:03:34.250> not<00:03:35.680> activate<00:03:36.680> right<00:03:37.040> away

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
engines it will not activate right away

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.440 
engines it will not activate right away
so<00:03:39.110> I'm<00:03:40.040> gonna<00:03:40.280> build<00:03:40.519> us<00:03:40.730> another<00:03:40.760> engine

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
so I'm gonna build us another engine

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.509 
so I'm gonna build us another engine
here<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:42.890> what<00:03:46.510> what<00:03:47.510> I've<00:03:47.660> done

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
here so you can see what what I've done

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.039 
here so you can see what what I've done
so<00:03:49.519> we<00:03:50.120> have<00:03:50.239> our<00:03:50.269> wooden<00:03:50.660> pipe<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.709> our<00:03:51.859> engine

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
so we have our wooden pipe in our engine

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:03.190 
so we have our wooden pipe in our engine
fuel<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:57.639> then<00:03:58.639> we<00:03:58.819> need<00:03:59.060> we<00:04:00.019> need<00:04:01.030> gold<00:04:02.200> gate

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
fuel and then we need we need gold gate

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.530 
fuel and then we need we need gold gate
gold<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.459> gate<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.590> some<00:04:06.590> red<00:04:06.709> pipe<00:04:06.950> wire<00:04:07.540> and

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
gold and gate and some red pipe wire and

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.970 
gold and gate and some red pipe wire and
put<00:04:08.989> both<00:04:09.139> those<00:04:09.380> on<00:04:11.139> then<00:04:12.139> once<00:04:12.680> again<00:04:12.859> we<00:04:13.400> do

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
put both those on then once again we do

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.759 
put both those on then once again we do
power<00:04:15.980> requested<00:04:17.289> although<00:04:18.289> I<00:04:18.350> want<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.620> say

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
power requested although I want to say

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.379 
power requested although I want to say
we<00:04:18.919> do<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.100> another<00:04:19.700> one<00:04:19.880> called<00:04:20.120> power

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
we do have another one called power

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.570 
we do have another one called power
overloaded<00:04:21.109> which<00:04:21.260> works<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.709> any<00:04:21.979> power<00:04:22.310> pipe

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
overloaded which works on any power pipe

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.420 
overloaded which works on any power pipe
and<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:24.139> triggers<00:04:24.500> whenever<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.979> pipe<00:04:25.160> turns

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
and it triggers whenever the pipe turns

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.940 
and it triggers whenever the pipe turns
red<00:04:25.729> I'm<00:04:26.690> not<00:04:26.870> sure<00:04:27.050> how<00:04:27.229> useful<00:04:27.500> that

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
red I'm not sure how useful that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.790 
red I'm not sure how useful that
actually<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.700> but<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.539> figured<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.229> could<00:04:30.260> add<00:04:30.620> it

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
actually is but I figured I could add it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.100 
actually is but I figured I could add it
just<00:04:30.830> because<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:35.330> power<00:04:36.110> requested<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:38.110> red

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
just because so power requested and red

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.779 
just because so power requested and red
pipe<00:04:39.440> sing<00:04:39.740> off<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.660> engine<00:04:41.979> red<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
pipe sing off and engine red is the

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.800 
pipe sing off and engine red is the
shutdown<00:04:44.180> condition<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.620> then<00:04:46.610> these<00:04:47.030> are

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
shutdown condition and then these are

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.020 
shutdown condition and then these are
both<00:04:48.410> redstone<00:04:49.099> signals<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.580> see<00:04:52.849> this

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
both redstone signals so you see this

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.060 
both redstone signals so you see this
one's<00:04:53.300> typically<00:04:53.780> false<00:04:54.110> which<00:04:54.590> means<00:04:54.890> this

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
one's typically false which means this

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.610 
one's typically false which means this
is<00:04:55.310> typically<00:04:55.700> true

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
is typically true

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.739 
is typically true
and<00:04:57.620> this<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.729> true<00:04:58.969> whenever<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.479> network

00:04:59.739 --> 00:04:59.749 
and this is true whenever the network

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.830 
and this is true whenever the network
needs<00:04:59.900> power<00:05:00.699> so<00:05:01.699> as<00:05:01.849> you<00:05:01.999> can<00:05:02.090> see<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.509> engine

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
needs power so as you can see the engine

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.019 
needs power so as you can see the engine
is<00:05:03.050> running<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.770> fill<00:05:03.979> up<00:05:04.099> the<00:05:04.249> buffer<00:05:04.639> in<00:05:04.879> the

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.029 
is running to fill up the buffer in the

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.829 
is running to fill up the buffer in the
wooden<00:05:05.270> pipe<00:05:05.479> which<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:07.539> 1.5<00:05:08.770> thousand<00:05:09.830> nope

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:10.839 
wooden pipe which is 1.5 thousand nope

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.379 
wooden pipe which is 1.5 thousand nope
yeah<00:05:11.839> 1.5<00:05:12.349> thousand<00:05:12.830> mega<00:05:13.009> joules<00:05:13.389> buffer

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
yeah 1.5 thousand mega joules buffer

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:22.029 
yeah 1.5 thousand mega joules buffer
it's<00:05:14.779> pretty<00:05:15.020> small<00:05:15.819> so<00:05:20.469> now<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.529> buffers

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
it's pretty small so now the buffers

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.939 
it's pretty small so now the buffers
full<00:05:22.279> it<00:05:22.460> shut<00:05:22.759> off<00:05:22.939> and<00:05:23.529> there's<00:05:24.529> no<00:05:24.589> power

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
full it shut off and there's no power

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.829 
full it shut off and there's no power
being<00:05:25.279> requested<00:05:25.639> from<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.270> but<00:05:26.870> we<00:05:27.499> can<00:05:28.839> pump

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
being requested from it but we can pump

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.059 
being requested from it but we can pump
the<00:05:30.020> network<00:05:30.319> up<00:05:31.539> and<00:05:32.539> you<00:05:33.319> see<00:05:33.499> all<00:05:33.740> these

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
the network up and you see all these

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.939 
the network up and you see all these
Indians<00:05:34.460> came<00:05:34.729> on<00:05:34.990> it's<00:05:35.990> currently<00:05:36.409> drawing

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
Indians came on it's currently drawing

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.159 
Indians came on it's currently drawing
down<00:05:37.099> power<00:05:37.460> out<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:37.849> buffer<00:05:38.029> once<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
down power out of the buffer once it

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.709 
down power out of the buffer once it
gets<00:05:39.349> below<00:05:39.529> half<00:05:39.889> the<00:05:40.729> buffers<00:05:41.089> half<00:05:41.330> empty

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
gets below half the buffers half empty

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.989 
gets below half the buffers half empty
it'll<00:05:41.960> come<00:05:42.139> back<00:05:42.169> on<00:05:42.439> again<00:05:42.770> but<00:05:43.580> I'm<00:05:43.789> not

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:43.999 
it'll come back on again but I'm not

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.519 
it'll come back on again but I'm not
sure<00:05:44.360> if<00:05:44.479> it's<00:05:44.599> gonna<00:05:44.810> make<00:05:45.139> it<00:05:45.319> that<00:05:45.469> far

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
sure if it's gonna make it that far

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:51.040 
sure if it's gonna make it that far
because<00:05:46.370> oh<00:05:47.210> there<00:05:47.749> goes<00:05:48.339> yeah<00:05:49.960> there's<00:05:50.960> a

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
because oh there goes yeah there's a

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.260 
because oh there goes yeah there's a
fairly<00:05:51.620> large<00:05:51.830> number<00:05:52.159> of<00:05:52.310> engines<00:05:52.849> on<00:05:53.029> this

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
fairly large number of engines on this

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.459 
fairly large number of engines on this
particular<00:05:53.569> network<00:05:56.050> fact<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.259> they<00:05:57.409> were

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
particular network fact that they were

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.480 
particular network fact that they were
all<00:05:57.710> running<00:05:58.009> we<00:05:58.430> might<00:05:59.089> be<00:05:59.479> pushing<00:05:59.930> the

anyways<00:06:13.500> that's<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:15.400> easiest<00:06:16.030> way<00:06:16.390> to<00:06:16.620> allow

your network to respond to demand you

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.450 
your network to respond to demand you
can<00:06:19.720> do<00:06:19.870> more<00:06:20.080> complicated<00:06:20.380> things<00:06:20.890> if<00:06:21.310> you

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
can do more complicated things if you

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.640 
can do more complicated things if you
wish<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:22.090> actually<00:06:22.660> shut<00:06:22.900> the<00:06:23.050> engines<00:06:23.380> off

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
wish and actually shut the engines off

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.550 
wish and actually shut the engines off
if<00:06:24.040> your<00:06:24.220> machines<00:06:24.610> have<00:06:24.850> no<00:06:25.060> work<00:06:25.560> because

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
if your machines have no work because

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.250 
if your machines have no work because
they<00:06:26.980> will<00:06:27.280> draw<00:06:27.640> power<00:06:27.910> when<00:06:28.360> idle<00:06:30.810> even<00:06:31.810> if

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
they will draw power when idle even if

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.400 
they will draw power when idle even if
they're<00:06:32.470> not<00:06:32.590> doing<00:06:32.860> anything<00:06:33.160> so<00:06:34.290> it's<00:06:35.290> a

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
they're not doing anything so it's a

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.620 
they're not doing anything so it's a
small<00:06:35.650> amount<00:06:35.800> of<00:06:35.950> power<00:06:36.130> but<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:39.610> they<00:06:40.390> all

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
small amount of power but and they all

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.280 
small amount of power but and they all
these<00:06:40.840> lasers<00:06:41.830> have<00:06:42.160> triggers<00:06:42.669> as<00:06:42.910> it<00:06:43.840> has

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
these lasers have triggers as it has

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.680 
these lasers have triggers as it has
work<00:06:44.590> triggers<00:06:45.100> or<00:06:45.400> something<00:06:46.330> like<00:06:46.480> that

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
work triggers or something like that

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.070 
work triggers or something like that
work<00:06:47.020> scheduled<00:06:47.880> she<00:06:48.880> can<00:06:49.360> trigger<00:06:49.570> off<00:06:49.810> that

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
work scheduled she can trigger off that

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.909 
work scheduled she can trigger off that
if<00:06:50.260> you<00:06:50.380> wish<00:06:51.090> and<00:06:52.230> turn<00:06:53.230> them<00:06:53.410> off<00:06:53.530> if<00:06:53.770> they

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
if you wish and turn them off if they

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.800 
if you wish and turn them off if they
turn<00:06:54.520> off<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.850> engines<00:06:55.120> if<00:06:55.300> they<00:06:55.480> have<00:06:55.630> no

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
turn off the engines if they have no

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.459 
turn off the engines if they have no
work<00:06:55.990> scheduled

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:03.469 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:06.939 

anyways<00:07:04.339> that's<00:07:05.209> how<00:07:05.419> you<00:07:05.659> keep<00:07:06.229> your<00:07:06.469> engines

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
anyways that's how you keep your engines

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.369 
anyways that's how you keep your engines
from<00:07:07.129> exploding<00:07:07.699> and<00:07:08.029> the<00:07:08.929> nice<00:07:09.080> thing<00:07:09.110> about

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:09.379 
from exploding and the nice thing about

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.059 
from exploding and the nice thing about
this<00:07:09.739> is<00:07:10.039> even<00:07:10.309> if<00:07:10.789> these<00:07:11.149> engines<00:07:11.779> have<00:07:12.169> no

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069 
this is even if these engines have no

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:16.359 
this is even if these engines have no
coolant<00:07:13.489> like<00:07:14.059> this<00:07:14.239> one<00:07:14.419> here<00:07:15.099> that's<00:07:16.099> no

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:16.369 
coolant like this one here that's no

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.359 
coolant like this one here that's no
coolant

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:18.369 
coolant

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:24.639 
coolant
it<00:07:19.369> will<00:07:19.959> eventually<00:07:21.159> overheat<00:07:22.779> and<00:07:23.779> because

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:24.649 
it will eventually overheat and because

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.419 
it will eventually overheat and because
of<00:07:24.679> that<00:07:24.979> third<00:07:25.639> trigger<00:07:25.999> on<00:07:26.300> the<00:07:26.389> thing<00:07:26.599> here

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:27.429 
of that third trigger on the thing here

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:31.269 
of that third trigger on the thing here
it<00:07:28.429> will<00:07:28.550> shut<00:07:28.879> off<00:07:28.909> and<00:07:29.360> cool<00:07:29.569> down<00:07:30.279> before

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:31.279 
it will shut off and cool down before

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:38.580 
it will shut off and cool down before
starting<00:07:31.939> back<00:07:32.089> up<00:07:32.119> again

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.470 

yeah<00:07:39.590> you<00:07:39.650> don't<00:07:40.160> really<00:07:40.520> want<00:07:40.880> to<00:07:41.060> use<00:07:41.270> the

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480 
yeah you don't really want to use the

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.420 
yeah you don't really want to use the
combustion<00:07:41.810> inches<00:07:42.260> unless<00:07:42.590> you<00:07:42.800> have<00:07:43.070> such<00:07:43.400> a

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
combustion inches unless you have such a

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.650 
combustion inches unless you have such a
gate<00:07:43.760> system<00:07:44.210> setup<00:07:46.240> because<00:07:47.240> they<00:07:47.450> make<00:07:47.630> a

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.660 
gate system setup because they make a

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.930 
gate system setup because they make a
pretty<00:07:47.870> big<00:07:47.990> crater<00:07:48.440> like<00:07:49.070> you<00:07:49.370> see<00:07:49.610> all<00:07:49.760> these

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 
pretty big crater like you see all these

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.170 
pretty big crater like you see all these
bricks<00:07:50.980> there<00:07:51.980> was<00:07:52.130> an<00:07:52.250> engine<00:07:52.610> sitting<00:07:52.910> right

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.180 
bricks there was an engine sitting right

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:02.680 
bricks there was an engine sitting right
here<00:07:54.250> and<00:07:55.250> it<00:07:55.670> exploded<00:07:58.690> so<00:08:00.250> anyways<00:08:01.360> this<00:08:02.360> had

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690 
here and it exploded so anyways this had

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.500 
here and it exploded so anyways this had
been<00:08:03.260> another<00:08:04.070> feature<00:08:04.430> of<00:08:04.610> the<00:08:05.090> new<00:08:05.120> power

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:05.510 
been another feature of the new power

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:11.410 
been another feature of the new power
system<00:08:05.990> and<00:08:07.360> this<00:08:08.360> is<00:08:08.720> covert<00:08:09.620> Jaguar<00:08:10.420> signing

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:11.420 
system and this is covert Jaguar signing

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.510 
system and this is covert Jaguar signing
off<00:08:11.540> and<00:08:12.400> see<00:08:13.400> you<00:08:13.610> guys<00:08:13.640> next<00:08:14.090> time
