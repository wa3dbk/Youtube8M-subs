00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.410
 that actually happens on the track as 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.789
 it gets hot when it gets very hot 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.530
 in the Netherlands that is natural 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.580
 very nice for the Netherlands too 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.380
 we can all go to the beach nicely 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.930
 but from prorail it means we 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.190
 become very alert to the effects 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.510
 from warm weather 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.490
 there are actually two very important ones 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.530
 effects in warm weather 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 that is first of all the expulsion of it 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.340
 track to give you a little more insight 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.870
 of the phenomenon have traces expansion 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.809
 I have a piece of track that included 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.190
 is this and if it is summer now very summery 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.160
 is very hot then such a piece 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.320
 rail just 70 degrees and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.579
 that means the rail then one 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.410
 a little bit bigger and I have that 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.510
 never taken you to show how 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.000
 this piece of track is about to get bigger 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.530
 well that seems very limited but if 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.060
 you imagine you just broke 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.680
 rail can have from one 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.640
 kilometer or two kilometers 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.590
 then it's really about tens 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480
 centimeters where the track becomes 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.710
 extended and we must 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.149
 we need construction of the track 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.430
 compensate for that 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.290
 and if that does not happen or not properly 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 happens then the track tends 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.620
 to roll out and then we have 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.940
 problems to perform the service there 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.500
 so that should never happen 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.500
 And we make sure it isn't either 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.479
 happened before a very hot one 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.290
 periods but also during very hot 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.630
 periods 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.970
 inspectors of van prorail 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.350
 the location of tracks to see if 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.310
 the track well with a light chin like that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 required 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.390
 correct them and those controls 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 We also call it Hitting Scale 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.580
 performed at high risk every summer 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.439
 location and that other point that we quite 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.150
 be alert that hot weather is going too 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.150
 often accompanied by thunder 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.460
 koda to some things 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.470
 lightning strike 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.939
 The simplest of course is that 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 we our buildings 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.780
 equipped with a pixel arrester such that 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 when lightning strikes 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 stream can be neatly disposed of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 we continue to work on is for example 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.050
 here in Utrecht that we design 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.510
 infrastructure so try 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.220
 make it happen that lightning strikes somewhere 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.410
 the effects of lightning very local 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.090
 remain limited and therefore not over the whole 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.040
 station, the spreading 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.569
 as just explained care with it as 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.760
 prorail for the effects of 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.590
 minimize lightning strike 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.970
 but we have 7,000 kilometers of track 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.530
 lie outside so it can always be us 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.970
 we happen to have one 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.410
 have a lightning strike 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.299
 well for those situations we have 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.310
 disorder teams are outside that way 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.989
 resolve malfunction as quickly as possible 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 to ensure that our travelers 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.400
 PR can travel as quickly as possible 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.400
