they<00:03:02.530> do<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.040> they<00:03:03.190> don't<00:03:03.340> it'd<00:03:03.549> be<00:03:03.640> very

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
they do it if they don't it'd be very

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310 
they do it if they don't it'd be very
disappointing<00:03:04.330> if<00:03:04.420> they<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.720> repack<00:03:05.110> this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
disappointing if they just repack this

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.490 
disappointing if they just repack this
car<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.769> say<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.600> 500<00:03:08.049> winner<00:03:08.200> because

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
like I said before unfortunately we

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.680 
like I said before unfortunately we
don't<00:03:21.459> get<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.670> driver<00:03:21.940> picture<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.420> kind<00:03:22.660> of

don't get a driver picture I kind of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.569 
don't get a driver picture I kind of
wish<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.840> did<00:03:23.170> but<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.370> kind<00:03:24.549> of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
wish we did but that's kind of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.059 
wish we did but that's kind of
nitpicking<00:03:24.970> here<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.690> back<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> they

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
nitpicking here is the back and they

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.790 
nitpicking here is the back and they
will<00:03:27.190> probably<00:03:27.370> have<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.900> update<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.110> as<00:03:29.380> he

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
will probably have to update this as he

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.710 
will probably have to update this as he
won

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
won

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.320
