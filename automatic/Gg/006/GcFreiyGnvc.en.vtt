stainless<00:07:19.050> that<00:07:19.230> I've<00:07:19.889> been<00:07:20.040> talking<00:07:20.400> about<00:07:20.490> I

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
stainless that I've been talking about I

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.659 
stainless that I've been talking about I
had<00:07:21.540> a<00:07:21.570> shot<00:07:21.870> probably<00:07:22.350> about<00:07:22.710> 50<00:07:23.160> 60<00:07:23.520> yards

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:23.669 
had a shot probably about 50 60 yards

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.760 
had a shot probably about 50 60 yards
closer<00:07:24.030> a<00:07:24.270> little<00:07:24.690> bit<00:07:24.810> earlier<00:07:25.139> so<00:07:25.500> I<00:07:25.530> knew

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
closer a little bit earlier so I knew

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.750 
closer a little bit earlier so I knew
the<00:07:25.889> range<00:07:26.070> on<00:07:26.280> this<00:07:26.430> one

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:26.760 
the range on this one

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.530 
the range on this one
however<00:07:28.220> 359<00:07:29.220> yards<00:07:29.550> I<00:07:29.639> do<00:07:29.700> not<00:07:29.940> recommend<00:07:30.300> for

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
however 359 yards I do not recommend for

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.870 
however 359 yards I do not recommend for
the<00:07:30.750> 20<00:07:31.020> grain<00:07:31.229> bullet<00:07:31.530> it<00:07:32.490> did<00:07:32.669> hit<00:07:32.850> the

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
the 20 grain bullet it did hit the

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.580 
the 20 grain bullet it did hit the
prairie<00:07:33.180> dog<00:07:33.419> it<00:07:33.600> did<00:07:33.750> kill<00:07:33.960> the<00:07:34.139> prairie<00:07:34.350> dog

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.590 
prairie dog it did kill the prairie dog

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.120 
prairie dog it did kill the prairie dog
but<00:07:35.400> the<00:07:35.520> bullet<00:07:35.850> performance<00:07:36.450> was<00:07:36.750> not<00:07:37.139> what

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
but the bullet performance was not what

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.879 
but the bullet performance was not what
I<00:07:38.310> would<00:07:38.610> expect<00:07:38.880> at<00:07:39.780> that<00:07:40.050> yardage<00:07:40.470> because

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889 
I would expect at that yardage because

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.129 
I would expect at that yardage because
the<00:07:41.040> 20<00:07:41.310> grain<00:07:41.460> bullet<00:07:41.790> is<00:07:41.940> so<00:07:42.150> light<00:07:42.419> that

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 
the 20 grain bullet is so light that

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:44.300 
the 20 grain bullet is so light that
even<00:07:43.440> though<00:07:43.530> it's<00:07:43.650> leaving<00:07:43.830> the<00:07:43.950> barrel<00:07:44.250> at

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
even though it's leaving the barrel at
