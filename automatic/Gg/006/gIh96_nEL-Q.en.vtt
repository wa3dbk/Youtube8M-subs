basically<00:00:15.120> set<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.809> sets<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
basically set up in two sets just to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
basically set up in two sets just to
show<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.949> quickly<00:00:17.310> how<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> sets<00:00:18.000> may<00:00:18.210> that's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
show you quickly how the sets may that's

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.290 
show you quickly how the sets may that's
a<00:00:18.570> figure<00:00:18.779> eight<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.920> system<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> basically<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
a figure eight the system is basically a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.050 
a figure eight the system is basically a
click<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.810> go<00:00:21.990> track<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> 143rd<00:00:23.730> scale

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
click and go track this is 143rd scale

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.769 
click and go track this is 143rd scale
or<00:00:24.210> smaller<00:00:24.570> set<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.859> clicks<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.779> it's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
or smaller set it just clicks and it's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
or smaller set it just clicks and it's
ready<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:29.010> guard<00:00:29.310> rails<00:00:29.580> are<00:00:29.820> very

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
ready to go your guard rails are very

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600 
ready to go your guard rails are very
easy<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.420> put<00:00:30.689> together<00:00:30.890> basically<00:00:31.890> you're

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
easy to put together basically you're

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
easy to put together basically you're
just<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> snap<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:33.960> pieces

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
just going to snap the two pieces

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
just going to snap the two pieces
together<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> whole<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
together or you can do the whole the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
together or you can do the whole the
whole<00:00:36.480> stretch<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.559> big<00:00:37.860> string<00:00:38.520> if

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
whole stretch in one big string if

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.569 
whole stretch in one big string if
you'll<00:00:38.850> want<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.710> basically<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> start

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you'll want and basically you can start

basically outside car from flying off

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
basically outside car from flying off
the<00:01:06.630> track<00:01:06.990> okay

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the track okay

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
the track okay
now<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> next<00:01:08.580> thing<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.150> then

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
now the next thing you're gonna do then

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
now the next thing you're gonna do then
you've<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.229> three<00:01:10.560> connectors<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.549> your

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you've got three connectors into your

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
you've got three connectors into your
terminal<00:01:11.970> base<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.810> terminal<00:01:13.080> base

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
terminal base this is your terminal base

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
terminal base this is your terminal base
it<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.130> controllers<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it has your two controllers and your

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.870 
it has your two controllers and your
power<00:01:15.450> outlet<00:01:16.310> everything<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> notch

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
power outlet everything has a notch

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.840 
power outlet everything has a notch
which<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> fits<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> don't

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
which it fits right into so you don't

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.280 
which it fits right into so you don't
have<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> worry<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.360> putting<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
have to worry about putting it in the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
have to worry about putting it in the
wrong<00:01:22.470> direction<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.310> you've<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> all

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
wrong direction so you've got that all

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.600 
wrong direction so you've got that all
plugged<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.560> plug<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.009> power<00:01:26.220> unit

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
plugged in you then plug your power unit

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
plugged in you then plug your power unit
into<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.880> power<00:01:27.180> supply<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.049> an<00:01:28.229> outlet<00:01:28.560> at

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
into your power supply like an outlet at

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
into your power supply like an outlet at
home<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.000> test<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.600> cars<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
home you then test which cars on the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.670 
home you then test which cars on the
track<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.280> car<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.090> track

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
track so we got that car on that track

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
track so we got that car on that track
you<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> track<00:01:35.549> pass<00:01:35.880> slowly<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you go around the track pass slowly to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
you go around the track pass slowly to
make<00:01:36.930> sure<00:01:37.140> there's<00:01:37.320> no<00:01:37.530> dead<00:01:37.890> pieces<00:01:38.189> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
make sure there's no dead pieces but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
make sure there's no dead pieces but
usually<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.210> isn't<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.200> track<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> pretty

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
usually there isn't the track is pretty

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030 
usually there isn't the track is pretty
tight<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.759> secure<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:43.320> check<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.890> other

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tight and secure then check your other

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
tight and secure then check your other
car<00:01:44.399> make<00:01:44.700> sure<00:01:44.729> your<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.119> car<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.630> going

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
car make sure your other car is going

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
car make sure your other car is going
around<00:01:45.990> yep<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.979> around<00:01:47.250> outside

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
around yep it's going around outside

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149 
around yep it's going around outside
inside<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.049> basically<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.619> track<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
inside so that basically the track is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.679 
inside so that basically the track is
the<00:01:50.670> same<00:01:50.970> length<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> track<00:01:53.540> once<00:01:54.540> you've

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the same length and track once you've

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.240 
the same length and track once you've
