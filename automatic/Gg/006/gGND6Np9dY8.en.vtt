00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.440
 Ramadan is fast approaching and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.480
 I did not find better than the recipe 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.259
 is dead cheese which everyone 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 crazy 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.150
 this Indian step that also looks like 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.799
 Moroccan pancakes can be eaten well 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.799
 hot and stuffed with cheese 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 in a small bowl I'm going to tell him a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 dehydrated yeast sachet with a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 little warm water and to help our 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.590
 yeast rose well I added a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.590
 spoon of caster sugar 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 so like all the legs we can 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 work either by hand or euros 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 today I decided to work 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 but michelin can we show to those who 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.970
 do not have a robot at home 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.130
 how to make their pact by hand the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.100
 first step you have to mix first 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.960
 all elements dry flour salt 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 the chemical fury aln 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.970
 so we'll be able to start already at 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.410
 mix these dry elements and we're going 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 able to form a well the second 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.310
 step it's the liquid elements that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.369
 we go to a snack in the well 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.160
 of which a tablespoon of oil a 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.800
 pot of yoghurt velvety yeast 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.930
 dehydrated baker that you will have 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.259
 previously allow to inflate with a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.259
 little water 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.070
 and we'll start kneading the dough 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.070
 add water as you go 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 after ten minutes the kneaded dough 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.270
 so we'll let her rest for 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 two hours and we will cover it with 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.990
 a towel 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.090
 after two hours our leg has 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.040
 well inflated so we will be able 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 make cheese neumann 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.370
 here I choose a pot 200 g of cheese 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.830
 philadelphia that you can replace 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.230
 with any melted cheese from 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.150
 small red and green peppers half 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.510
 onion and a big spoon of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.510
 coriander 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.360
 we will mix all the ingredients in 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.260
 a bowl and we will reserve your stuffing at 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.210
 fresh I'm going first in flour and the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.100
 workplan 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.240
 I recover each time chickens that 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.240
 I had previously oiled 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.440
 at that moment it is not necessary too much 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.450
 work the dough 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.940
 we are going to put our prank of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.490
 cheese with false tunes forming a ball 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.810
 then goes flat to form 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.810
 our note using a roll 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.190
 go slowly that cheese does not 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.190
 not escape 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.229
 now we will leather our pancakes 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:31.130
 in an oven previously preheated to 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.680
 260 degrees for 5 to 6 minutes to 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.240
 monitor closely so these are the net 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.340
 are already ready you can 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.780
 brush with olive oil or butter 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.780
 it's like you want 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.129
 So here is my video coming to an end 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.629
 I hope that today's recipe 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.620
