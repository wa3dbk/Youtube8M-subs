for San Diego I don't know that
I<00:02:12.700> don't<00:02:13.209> think<00:02:13.240> Seattle<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.930> in

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
I don't think Seattle is going to be in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.540 
I don't think Seattle is going to be in
fact<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.319> bet<00:02:14.800> against<00:02:15.160> them<00:02:15.220> they're<00:02:15.400> not

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
fact I bet against them they're not

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.010 
fact I bet against them they're not
going<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.730> be<00:02:15.819> able<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.000> do<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.270> against<00:02:16.959> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
going to be able to do this against the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.900 
going to be able to do this against the
Chicago<00:02:17.530> Bears<00:02:17.709> because<00:02:18.459> they're<00:02:18.640> not<00:02:18.760> going

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Chicago Bears because they're not going

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.339 
Chicago Bears because they're not going
to<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.150> same<00:02:19.540> motivation<00:02:20.080> from<00:02:20.170> their

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
to have that same motivation from their

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.870 
to have that same motivation from their
head<00:02:20.470> coach<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.160> think<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.430> more<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.700> go

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
head coach and I think it's more of a go

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.059 
head coach and I think it's more of a go
into<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.180> motion<00:02:22.540> situation<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.620> Seattle<00:02:23.980> in

a dollar thirty but I still think it's a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
about with Chad Henne on the field I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.170 
about with Chad Henne on the field I
think<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.709> ideal<00:03:59.980> situation<00:04:00.609> for<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
think the ideal situation for the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.390 
think the ideal situation for the
Jacksonville<00:04:01.690> Jaguars<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.859> Chad<00:04:03.130> Henne

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
Jacksonville Jaguars is that Chad Henne

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.979 
Jacksonville Jaguars is that Chad Henne
comes<00:04:03.700> out<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.000> gets<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.329> play<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.630> stays<00:04:04.810> on

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
rookie I like bortles but I think he

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.310
