00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.430
 in a feminine and nostalgic atmosphere 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.919
 is the work of Leslie Rabbit 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.559
 a photographer from Tijuana who makes four 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.869
 years decided to devote himself to taking pictures already 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:33.770
 change the direction of your vocation when 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.780
 I am communication I started in the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.300
 photography because the race so 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.530
 demanded 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 but 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 really when I took the pictures I 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.650
 they looked good then I realized that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.150
 he had a kind of talent and the same 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.050
 free has been very foolish if it was not 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.660
 exploited 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.390
 that when I left the race and you saw 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 jobs did not interest me how to work 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.699
 in an office or in a place where 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.659
 where they could not what I liked that 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.659
 I was taking pictures 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.300
 all right 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.250
 for Leslie the female body is almost 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 a complex jewel with beautiful volume 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.510
 when he sees my models and I see someone 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 new is with 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.870
 that is, women are never going to stop 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.350
 be and while they are I want 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.740
 keep portraying the beauty of them and 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.680
 if I would like to continue but more for the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 feminine but I also want to like 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.530
 I want to get more into projects a lot 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.500
 plus 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.049
 arts that come to reflect more than 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.510
 the woman I chose rabbit has a study 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.159
 in the gÃ³mez passage an underground that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.900
 locate on Revolution Avenue 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.940
 then there are artists with 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.590
 diverse ideas and works that define 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.229
 who they are and what they want 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.479
 show of themselves then from the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.550
 place 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.560
 attracts me a lot 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.770
 I feel it is a part of the center that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.290
 I was very forgotten and that every time 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.900
 I took a picture it's like no look wait 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.020
 that is alive or is still here 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.650
 they can do nice things and there are things 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.439
 good to do in places that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 that are in places in the city that you 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.730
 you do not expect them to be because when 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.220
 you enter my studio nothing to do with the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.360
 situation that is out there or with the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.060
 good passage with what is the part 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.800
 internal or downtown street nothing 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.770
 what to see here was very safe and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.130
 I like I like it very much I feel it is a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.680
 intimate workshop this 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.320

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.630
 inspiration and personal food here is 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.790
 nourishes to continue creating to offer 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.210

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.260
