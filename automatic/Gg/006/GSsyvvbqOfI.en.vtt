this requires lubrication oil you could
use<00:00:50.309> water<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.899> light<00:00:52.590> oil<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
other side what it does is help to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.840 
other side what it does is help to
slough<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.530> metal<00:00:58.949> filings<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.640> you're

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
there's a reason for that because I've

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.490 
there's a reason for that because I've
never<00:01:04.979> needed<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.290> here's<00:01:07.290> another

stone here real limited comes from

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
and I think this is synthetic this one
here<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.439> another<00:01:52.710> Arkansas<00:01:53.310> stone<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
here this is another Arkansas stone this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.429 
here this is another Arkansas stone this

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but it's been used so this is a pretty

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.180

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
chisels now I'm going to show you how to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.479 
chisels now I'm going to show you how to
start<00:03:16.670> if<00:03:17.670> you've<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.620> really<00:03:19.620> bad<00:03:20.010> edge

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
start if you've got a really bad edge

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.400 
start if you've got a really bad edge
one<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.180> never<00:03:21.420> been<00:03:22.100> sharpened<00:03:24.410> maybe

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
one that's never been sharpened maybe

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.100 
one that's never been sharpened maybe
it's<00:03:25.620> got<00:03:25.800> dings<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.790> dents<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.540> nicks<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.930> it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
it's got dings and dents and nicks in it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.449 
it's got dings and dents and nicks in it
you<00:03:28.260> might<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.709> look<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.190> under<00:03:29.310> a

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
you might have to look at it under a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.699 
you might have to look at it under a
with<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> magnifying<00:03:30.840> glass<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.170> see<00:03:32.390> but

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
with a magnifying glass to see but

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.500 
with a magnifying glass to see but
sometime<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.640> blade<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.239> got

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
sometime if you have a blade that's got

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.060 
sometime if you have a blade that's got
a<00:03:36.540> fairly<00:03:36.930> decent<00:03:37.230> edge<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:37.920> might

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
a fairly decent edge on it you might

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.620 
a fairly decent edge on it you might
want<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.580> start<00:03:38.880> with<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> rough<00:03:39.420> you

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
want it on to start with a rough you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.270 
want it on to start with a rough you
might<00:03:39.780> want<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.050> start<00:03:40.320> with<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> medium<00:03:40.830> side

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
might want to start with a medium side

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.370 
might want to start with a medium side
but<00:03:42.209> let's<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.720> say<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.350> a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
but let's just say that you have a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.009 
but let's just say that you have a
really<00:03:43.769> bad<00:03:44.150> blade<00:03:45.150> or<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.660> bad<00:03:45.900> edge<00:03:46.170> on

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
really bad blade or a really bad edge on

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.360 
really bad blade or a really bad edge on
each<00:03:49.019> blade<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> little<00:03:49.860> different

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
each blade is a little different

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.970 
each blade is a little different
depending<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.000> thickness<00:03:51.800> but<00:03:52.800> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
depending on the thickness but that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.920 
depending on the thickness but that
would<00:03:53.160> determine<00:03:53.459> what<00:03:53.790> angle<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.600> want<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
would determine what angle you want to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.440 
would determine what angle you want to
hold<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.560> at<00:03:56.750> generally<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.820> angle<00:04:00.300> would

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
hold this at generally a the angle would

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.050 
hold this at generally a the angle would
be<00:04:00.480> between<00:04:01.010> 15<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.340> 25<00:04:03.239> degrees<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:05.060> for

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
be between 15 and 25 degrees and for

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.540 
be between 15 and 25 degrees and for
those<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.510> may<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.870> know<00:04:07.110> what<00:04:07.860> degrees<00:04:08.190> are

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
those that may not know what degrees are

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.089 
those that may not know what degrees are
that<00:04:08.910> would<00:04:09.090> be

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
that would be

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.500 
that would be
90<00:04:10.489> degrees<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:11.269> would<00:04:12.049> be<00:04:12.310> 45<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.819> that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
90 degrees that would be 45 and that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.340 
90 degrees that would be 45 and that
would<00:04:14.749> be<00:04:14.900> 22<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:16.009> half<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.120> between<00:04:17.690> 15<00:04:18.320> and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
would be 22 and a half so between 15 and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.969 
would be 22 and a half so between 15 and
25<00:04:18.979> degrees<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.729> generally<00:04:20.239> what<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.570> want<00:04:20.979> if

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
25 degrees is generally what you want if

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.580 
25 degrees is generally what you want if
you<00:04:22.100> had<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.539> blade<00:04:23.539> with<00:04:23.750> her<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.259> was<00:04:24.380> really

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
you had a blade with her that was really

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.290 
you had a blade with her that was really
thick<00:04:24.949> you<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.370> want<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.669> go<00:04:25.789> towards<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
thick you would want to go towards the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.749 
thick you would want to go towards the
25<00:04:26.750> degree<00:04:27.080> angle<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.620> thin<00:04:28.310> blade<00:04:28.550> you

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
25 degree angle and a thin blade you

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.400 
25 degree angle and a thin blade you
would<00:04:28.880> want<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> go<00:04:29.270> towards<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.690> 15<00:04:30.050> degrees

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
would want to go towards the 15 degrees

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.950 
would want to go towards the 15 degrees
so<00:04:31.370> now<00:04:31.880> I'm<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.120> show<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.509> basic

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
so now I'm going to show you the basic

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.950 
so now I'm going to show you the basic
strokes<00:04:34.150> before<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> do<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.479> don't<00:04:35.720> let<00:04:35.870> me

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
strokes before I do that don't let me

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.860 
strokes before I do that don't let me
tell<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.259> as<00:04:36.560> you're<00:04:37.120> pulling<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.419> towards

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
tell you as you're pulling this towards

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.879 
tell you as you're pulling this towards
you<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:40.340> happens<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.479> very<00:04:42.110> edge<00:04:42.740> of

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
you what happens is the the very edge of

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.180 
you what happens is the the very edge of
this<00:04:43.070> blade<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.360> get<00:04:44.509> this<00:04:44.810> birth<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.770> curve

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
this blade you get this birth this curve

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.790 
this blade you get this birth this curve
that<00:04:46.490> curves<00:04:46.789> over<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:47.990> you're<00:04:48.259> stroking<00:04:48.590> it

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that curves over if you're stroking it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.969 
that curves over if you're stroking it
this<00:04:48.979> way<00:04:49.220> that<00:04:49.940> curves<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.599> away<00:04:50.870> it's<00:04:51.830> not

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
this way that curves that away it's not

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:52.810 
this way that curves that away it's not
something<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.310> can<00:04:52.400> see<00:04:52.580> with<00:04:52.699> your<00:04:52.729> naked

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
something you can see with your naked

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.360 
something you can see with your naked
eye<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.539> you<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.840> feel<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.320> with<00:04:54.440> your<00:04:54.650> finger

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
eye but you can feel it with your finger

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.300 
eye but you can feel it with your finger
to<00:04:55.550> do<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.650> what<00:04:57.650> you're<00:04:57.830> doing<00:04:57.979> is

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
to do that and what you're doing is

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.350 
to do that and what you're doing is
you're<00:04:58.789> sharpening<00:04:59.389> that<00:04:59.860> burr<00:05:00.970> away<00:05:01.970> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
you're sharpening that burr away and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.589 
you're sharpening that burr away and
you're<00:05:02.630> sharpening<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:04.240> until<00:05:05.240> there's<00:05:05.419> no

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
you're sharpening it until there's no

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.870 
you're sharpening it until there's no
more<00:05:05.630> burr<00:05:06.050> until<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.889> edge<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.280> fine<00:05:07.520> and

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
more burr until the edge is fine and

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.650 
more burr until the edge is fine and
there's<00:05:08.030> no<00:05:08.150> more<00:05:08.300> burr

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
there's no more burr

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.820 
there's no more burr
so<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:10.340> know<00:05:10.460> people<00:05:11.360> do<00:05:12.139> this<00:05:12.380> differently

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
so you know people do this differently

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.170

here we go I do five strokes on either
side<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.889> I<00:05:37.729> pull<00:05:38.330> it<00:05:38.479> towards<00:05:38.780> me<00:05:38.870> lots<00:05:39.169> of

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
side and I pull it towards me lots of

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.680 
side and I pull it towards me lots of
people<00:05:39.620> go<00:05:40.280> in<00:05:40.460> both<00:05:40.610> directions<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:41.389> just<00:05:41.599> go

in one direction and here's how I do it

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.960 
in one direction and here's how I do it
I<00:05:43.780> rest<00:05:44.780> my<00:05:44.930> fingers<00:05:45.320> on<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.590> blade<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:46.099> I

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
I rest my fingers on the blade and I

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.839 
I rest my fingers on the blade and I
pull<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.900> towards<00:05:48.139> me<00:05:48.169> like<00:05:48.349> that

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.060 

as<00:05:52.849> you<00:05:53.509> come<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.960> curb<00:05:54.199> in<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:54.800> want<00:05:54.979> to

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
as you come to the curb in you want to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.680 
as you come to the curb in you want to
lift<00:05:55.250> up<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.610> little<00:05:55.729> bit<00:05:55.969> I<00:05:58.300> think<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.570> was

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
lift up a little bit I think that was

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.320 
lift up a little bit I think that was
five<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.229> flip<00:06:00.860> it<00:06:00.889> over<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:02.060> go<00:06:02.180> on<00:06:02.300> the

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
five and flip it over and you go on the

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:15.999 
five and flip it over and you go on the
opposite<00:06:02.780> direction<00:06:13.419> this<00:06:14.419> blade<00:06:14.830> right<00:06:15.830> now

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
opposite direction this blade right now

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.680 
opposite direction this blade right now
I<00:06:16.039> can<00:06:16.310> shave<00:06:16.580> with<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:17.000> so<00:06:17.300> I'm<00:06:17.419> just<00:06:17.449> showing

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
I can shave with it so I'm just showing

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.450 
I can shave with it so I'm just showing
it<00:06:18.080> under<00:06:18.440> that<00:06:18.620> might<00:06:18.830> take<00:06:19.070> a<00:06:19.130> hundred

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
it under that might take a hundred

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.570 
it under that might take a hundred
strokes<00:06:19.880> on<00:06:20.180> this

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
strokes on this

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.029 
strokes on this
to<00:06:21.120> get<00:06:21.360> past<00:06:21.659> all<00:06:22.020> your<00:06:22.229> Nicks<00:06:22.439> and<00:06:22.560> dings<00:06:22.740> on

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
to get past all your Nicks and dings on

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.179 
to get past all your Nicks and dings on
your<00:06:23.159> blade<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:24.150> then<00:06:24.479> I<00:06:24.509> turned<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.080> over<00:06:25.199> once

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
your blade so then I turned it over once

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.460 
your blade so then I turned it over once
I<00:06:26.280> got<00:06:26.460> past<00:06:26.699> that<00:06:26.970> once<00:06:27.300> I<00:06:27.389> got<00:06:27.569> the<00:06:28.020> beginning

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
I got past that once I got the beginning

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.959 
I got past that once I got the beginning
edge<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.979> I<00:06:29.009> wanted<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.460> would<00:06:29.580> turn<00:06:29.759> it<00:06:29.849> over

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
edge that I wanted I would turn it over

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.240 
edge that I wanted I would turn it over
go<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.360> fine<00:06:30.629> edge<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.650> what<00:06:31.800> this<00:06:31.979> does

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
go to the fine edge and what this does

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.450 
go to the fine edge and what this does
let's<00:06:33.000> rub<00:06:33.360> out<00:06:33.569> all<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:34.169> scratches<00:06:34.830> on<00:06:35.009> the

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
let's rub out all the scratches on the

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:55.129 
let's rub out all the scratches on the
edge<00:06:35.639> that<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.240> rough<00:06:37.110> side<00:06:37.349> put<00:06:37.650> on<00:06:53.990> and<00:06:54.990> then

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
edge that the rough side put on and then

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.770 
edge that the rough side put on and then
I<00:06:55.169> would<00:06:55.379> be<00:06:55.500> done<00:06:55.710> with<00:06:55.889> that<00:06:56.069> oh<00:06:56.539> and<00:06:57.539> when

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
I would be done with that oh and when

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.110 
I would be done with that oh and when
you<00:06:57.870> get<00:06:58.050> that<00:06:58.889> kind<00:06:59.219> of<00:06:59.280> an<00:06:59.430> edge<00:06:59.580> on<00:06:59.819> it<00:06:59.849> when

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
you get that kind of an edge on it when
