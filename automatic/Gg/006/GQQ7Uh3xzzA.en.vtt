to the side each way and I'm looking for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.630 
to the side each way and I'm looking for
their<00:01:25.950> sense<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.520> strength<00:01:27.360> pain<00:01:28.290> and

their sense of strength pain and
limitation<00:01:29.640> movement<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.460> move<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
limitation movement and then we move on

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.810 
limitation movement and then we move on
for<00:01:33.150> passive<00:01:34.049> testing<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.189> moving<00:01:35.610> one

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
for passive testing or I'm moving one

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.740 
for passive testing or I'm moving one
body<00:01:36.090> part<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.850> I'm<00:01:38.850> testing<00:01:39.420> for

body part on another and I'm testing for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
body part on another and I'm testing for
if<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.650> pain<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
if there's pain when we do this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.039 
if there's pain when we do this
limitation<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.280> always<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.970> we

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
limitation and always when we do this we

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
limitation and always when we do this we
do<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.770> causing<00:01:47.100> them<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> most

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
do this with causing them the most

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
do this with causing them the most
minimal<00:01:48.420> amount<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> discomfort<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.890> I'm

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
minimal amount of discomfort so I'm

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.060 
minimal amount of discomfort so I'm
always<00:01:50.100> saying<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> patient<00:01:51.890> only<00:01:52.890> move

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
always saying to the patient only move

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.959 
always saying to the patient only move
until<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:54.000> hurts<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.820> just<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
until it just hurts just a little just a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
until it just hurts just a little just a
clue<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.930> interested<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.560> horrible<00:01:58.979> pain

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
clue I'm not interested in horrible pain

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520 
clue I'm not interested in horrible pain
and<00:01:59.460> that's<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.110> trying<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and that's not good so we're trying to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
and that's not good so we're trying to
minimize<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.880> discomfort<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> exam<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
minimize the discomfort in the exam the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280 
minimize the discomfort in the exam the
exam<00:02:04.680> takes<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> while<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.689> people<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.020> get

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
exam takes a while so people can get

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.790 
exam takes a while so people can get
sore<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.770> try<00:02:08.069> on

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
sore but we try on

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.080 
sore but we try on
make<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.610> less<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:11.460> then<00:02:12.460> after<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
make that less and then after the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.550 
make that less and then after the
accident<00:02:13.420> passively<00:02:13.960> winsome<00:02:14.320> doing

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
accident passively winsome doing

accident passively winsome doing
resistant<00:02:15.070> testing<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:16.090> testing<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
resistant testing like testing the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.110 
resistant testing like testing the
