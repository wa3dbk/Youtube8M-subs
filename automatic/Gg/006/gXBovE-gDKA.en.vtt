00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.639 
here with another redstone II thing I
built<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.000> Richard<00:00:06.330> server<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.500> my

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
built on Richard server and this is my

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
built on Richard server and this is my
human<00:00:07.970> sacrifice<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.300> sure<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.540> knew<00:00:09.690> who

human sacrifice for sure you knew who

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.900 
human sacrifice for sure you knew who
will<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:10.469> looking<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.519> basically<00:00:11.790> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
will just looking at it so basically I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.060 
will just looking at it so basically I

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
works as you jump down here and there's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
some gold which will spawn somewhere

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.950 
some gold which will spawn somewhere
around<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.500> area<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.580> did<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.180> once<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
around this area now I did that once I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.299 
around this area now I did that once I
have<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.519> huge<00:00:30.060> block<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.510> wood<00:00:31.309> known

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
have like a huge block of wood known

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
have like a huge block of wood known
Elton<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:35.930> under<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.500> some

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
Elton and under it I have some

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.610 
Elton and under it I have some
dispensers<00:00:38.550> that'll<00:00:38.940> shoot<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.620> will

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
dispensers that'll shoot it up and will

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.990 
dispensers that'll shoot it up and will
keep<00:00:40.649> trying<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> find<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.370> empty<00:00:41.460> space<00:00:41.760> which

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
keep trying to find an empty space which

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520 
keep trying to find an empty space which
happens<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.480> anywhere<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.170> area

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
happens to be anywhere in this area

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
happens to be anywhere in this area
right<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.420> let's<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.840> check

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
right here and let's go down here check

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.670 
right here and let's go down here check
this<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.360> cool<00:00:48.360> retro<00:00:48.600> redstone<00:00:49.410> trick

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this out I cool retro redstone trick

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.340 
this out I cool retro redstone trick
that<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> learned<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.250> while<00:00:50.399> ago<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> basically

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that I learned a while ago so basically

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.670 
that I learned a while ago so basically
underneath<00:00:52.770> olavo<00:00:53.070> there's<00:00:54.440> pressure<00:00:55.440> plates

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
underneath olavo there's pressure plates

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
underneath olavo there's pressure plates
and<00:00:56.309> those<00:00:56.579> pressure<00:00:56.850> plates<00:00:57.120> turn<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.899> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and those pressure plates turn off this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
and those pressure plates turn off this
would<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> activate<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.340> which<00:01:00.090> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
would you activate this thing which if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
would you activate this thing which if
you<00:01:00.359> didn't<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> could<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.680> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you didn't know you could do this with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.189 
you didn't know you could do this with
you<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.699> stack<00:01:02.969> bread<00:01:03.210> sewn<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you could just stack bread sewn up and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.190 
you could just stack bread sewn up and
up<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.129> open<00:01:05.489> slabs<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.900> works

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
up and up to an open slabs and it works

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.789 
up and up to an open slabs and it works
it's<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.430> much<00:01:08.670> faster<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:09.590> repeaters<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's so much faster than repeaters to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
it's so much faster than repeaters to
and<00:01:11.450> torch<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:12.960> each<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and torch thing because each one has a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
and torch thing because each one has a
one<00:01:13.799> big<00:01:13.979> lie<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> time<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.060> you're

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
one big lie so by the time it's you're

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
one big lie so by the time it's you're
done<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> seven<00:01:17.220> seven<00:01:17.939> second

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
done it's like a seven seven second

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.719 
done it's like a seven seven second
delay<00:01:18.689> before<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
delay before you actually get some so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
delay before you actually get some so
i've<00:01:21.060> only<00:01:21.270> i'm<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.350> 3<00:01:22.740> tape<00:01:22.950> delay

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
i've only i'm only using a 3 tape delay

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
i've only i'm only using a 3 tape delay
on<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.759> soon<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.509> there

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
on this so as soon as you go down there

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.929 
on this so as soon as you go down there
you<00:01:24.780> should<00:01:25.350> instantly<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.580> soon<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you should instantly like as soon as the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
you should instantly like as soon as the
guy<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.840> say<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.700> because<00:01:29.720> i<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
guy will say this because i think how it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
guy will say this because i think how it
works<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:34.320> step<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.130> i<00:01:35.360> might<00:01:36.360> change

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
works is they step on it i might change

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
works is they step on it i might change
this<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> it'll<00:01:37.619> only<00:01:37.829> give<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> stuff

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this so that it'll only give you stuff

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.080 
this so that it'll only give you stuff
when<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.640> die<00:01:42.740> which<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:43.890> could<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
when they die which i could do with a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.770 
when they die which i could do with a
redstone<00:01:48.090> torch<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:52.110> piece<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.740> redstone

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
redstone torch and a piece of redstone

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.350 
redstone torch and a piece of redstone
let's<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:58.159> now<00:01:59.360> when

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
let's just go do that right now now when

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.260 
let's just go do that right now now when
we<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:02.070> should<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.119> they

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we go down it should like if they

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.440 
we go down it should like if they
survive<00:02:03.689> somehow<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:05.009> act<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.240> try

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
survive somehow or don't act if they try

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
survive somehow or don't act if they try
to<00:02:06.479> resist<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.560> don't<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.890> no<00:02:08.069> shape

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to resist then they don't get no shape

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.910 
to resist then they don't get no shape
and<00:02:09.119> then

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.520
