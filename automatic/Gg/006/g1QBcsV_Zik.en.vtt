00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
gonna be showing you a design for a tree

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.950 
gonna be showing you a design for a tree
farm<00:00:12.469> this<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:13.889> my<00:00:14.040> design<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.839> gonna

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
farm this is not my design but I'm gonna

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.230 
farm this is not my design but I'm gonna
leave<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> link<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> original<00:00:17.279> creator<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700 
leave a link to the original creator I
just<00:00:18.539> felt<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.810> design<00:00:19.199> YouTube<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
just felt this design YouTube and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
just felt this design YouTube and
thought<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.160> cool<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.210> thought<00:00:21.480> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
thought was really cool and thought that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.779 
thought was really cool and thought that
his<00:00:22.050> design<00:00:22.439> deserved<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.160> more<00:00:23.310> attention

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
his design deserved a bit more attention

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
his design deserved a bit more attention
because<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.180> actually<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.500> cool

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
because it's actually really really cool

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.810 
because it's actually really really cool
so<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:25.949> leave<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> link<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> his<00:00:26.640> video

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
so I'm gonna leave a link to his video

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.800 
so I'm gonna leave a link to his video
in<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> description<00:00:28.490> under<00:00:29.490> yeah<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in the description under yeah so this is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
in the description under yeah so this is
a<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.080> awesome<00:00:31.579> basically<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a really awesome basically this is it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
a really awesome basically this is it
I'm<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.510> ahead<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> plant<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I'm just going to go ahead and plant it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:53.800 
I'm just going to go ahead and plant it
and<00:00:35.090> then<00:00:36.090> I'll<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.660> back

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.690 

okay<00:00:54.810> so<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.380> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:56.070> basic<00:00:56.340> design

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
okay so as you can see the basic design

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.320 
okay so as you can see the basic design
for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.240> farm<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.690> extremely<00:00:58.500> simple<00:00:59.330> so

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
for the farm is extremely simple so

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.120 
for the farm is extremely simple so
basically<00:01:00.600> we've<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:01.020> rings<00:01:01.320> here

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
basically we've got these rings here

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.920 
basically we've got these rings here
I<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.640> between<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.090> each<00:01:03.270> ring<00:01:03.570> we've<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:03.900> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I need between it each ring we've got a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.160 
I need between it each ring we've got a
gap<00:01:04.260> full<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.890> torches<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.730> we've<00:01:06.630> also<00:01:06.870> have

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
gap full of torches and we've also have

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.540 
gap full of torches and we've also have
a<00:01:07.200> roof<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:07.590> let<00:01:07.710> me<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.920> explain<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.310> few

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
a roof so let me just explain a few

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.340 
a roof so let me just explain a few
things<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:10.920> basically<00:01:11.550> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
things so the more on basically the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.280 
things so the more on basically the
larger<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.710> make<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:15.600> farm<00:01:15.930> basically

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
larger you make this this farm basically

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
larger you make this this farm basically
the<00:01:16.980> more<00:01:17.220> efficient<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.700> gonna<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the more efficient it's gonna be so it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.469 
the more efficient it's gonna be so it
seems<00:01:18.390> simple<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.760> one<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
seems simple but so it's just one by one

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.320 
seems simple but so it's just one by one
that<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.840> only<00:01:21.930> gonna<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.850> get<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.090> tree

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that it's only gonna make get one tree

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.540 
that it's only gonna make get one tree
but<00:01:24.510> if<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.110> four<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.040> four<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> you're

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
but if you get four by four and you're

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.950 
but if you get four by four and you're
gonna<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.850> considerably<00:01:27.450> more<00:01:27.660> than<00:01:27.869> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
gonna get considerably more than you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.490 
gonna get considerably more than you
would<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.800> just<00:01:29.100> having<00:01:29.750> four<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:31.320> by

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
would get of just having four one by

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
would get of just having four one by
ones<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> mean

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
ones if you it if you know what I mean

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.390 
ones if you it if you know what I mean
basically<00:01:34.250> yeah

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
basically yeah

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.359 
basically yeah
it's<00:01:35.580> basically<00:01:35.880> self-explanatory<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.869> yeah

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
it's basically self-explanatory but yeah

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.400 
it's basically self-explanatory but yeah
and<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.270> compact<00:01:39.660> farm<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
and this is a very compact farm so

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.350 
and this is a very compact farm so
instead<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> having<00:01:41.160> just<00:01:41.880> running<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
instead of having just running and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880 
instead of having just running and
placing<00:01:42.690> trees<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.259> basically<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> most

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
placing trees this is basically the most

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
placing trees this is basically the most
compact<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.580> make<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> tree<00:01:45.390> farm<00:01:45.630> while

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
compact you can make a tree farm while

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
compact you can make a tree farm while
still<00:01:46.950> retaining<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.550> efficiency<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:49.290> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
still retaining the efficiency and this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.420 
still retaining the efficiency and this
should<00:01:49.950> gain<00:01:50.310> new<00:01:50.640> trees<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.900> aren't

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
should gain new trees that aren't

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.530 
should gain new trees that aren't
oversized<00:01:53.430> basically<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.060> because<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
oversized basically that because of this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
oversized basically that because of this
roof<00:01:55.220> certain<00:01:56.220> trees<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:57.030> grow<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
roof certain trees you know they grow so

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.570 
roof certain trees you know they grow so
large<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.620> can't<00:01:58.890> get<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.400> wood

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
large they just you can't get the wood

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.010 
large they just you can't get the wood
out<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.790> them<00:02:00.030> because<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.540> leaves<00:02:00.750> are<00:02:00.960> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
out of them because the leaves are in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.960 
out of them because the leaves are in
the<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:02.040> should<00:02:02.310> prevent<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.760> so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the way this should prevent that so

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.640 
the way this should prevent that so
basically<00:02:03.120> if<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.870> some<00:02:04.229> blocks<00:02:04.409> I'll

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
basically if we get some blocks I'll

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.030 
basically if we get some blocks I'll
show<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.970> tall<00:02:06.300> this<00:02:06.450> roof<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.890> go

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
show you how tall this roof is so we go

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.490 
show you how tall this roof is so we go
out<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.479> basically<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.019> is<00:02:10.200> where

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
out one two so basically this is where

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.380 
out one two so basically this is where
this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.550> where<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.209> blocks<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.350> above

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
this is where the blocks are so above

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.120 
this is where the blocks are so above
above<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> block<00:02:16.500> above<00:02:16.890> these

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
above this is just the block above these

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.580 
above this is just the block above these
these<00:02:17.760> saplings<00:02:18.090> above<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:18.989> two

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
these saplings above that's one two

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.729 
these saplings above that's one two
three<00:02:20.190> four<00:02:20.549> five<00:02:21.090> wait<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.350> again

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
three four five wait what was it again

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.590 
three four five wait what was it again
one<00:02:23.700> two<00:02:24.090> three<00:02:24.660> four<00:02:25.080> five<00:02:25.530> six<00:02:26.100> six<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
one two three four five six six just a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.539 
one two three four five six six just a
six<00:02:27.840> box<00:02:28.110> above<00:02:28.440> because<00:02:29.010> you've<00:02:29.220> already<00:02:29.340> got

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
six box above because you've already got

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.160 
six box above because you've already got
one<00:02:29.580> tree<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.299> can<00:02:30.420> boat<00:02:30.660> bonemeal

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
one tree here you can boat bonemeal

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.190 
one tree here you can boat bonemeal
these<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.760> yet<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.720> don't<00:02:33.870> want<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.049> build

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
these and yet you don't want to build

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600 
these and yet you don't want to build
this<00:02:34.320> much<00:02:34.530> higher<00:02:34.769> than<00:02:34.920> six<00:02:35.190> blocks<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.489> can

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
this much higher than six blocks you can

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.520 
this much higher than six blocks you can
build<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:35.970> below<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.510> higher<00:02:36.750> but

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
build it just below or just higher but

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.690 
build it just below or just higher but
that's<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.830> get<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> optimum

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that's going to get you the optimum

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.740 
that's going to get you the optimum
amount<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.450> wood

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
amount of wood

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
amount of wood
so<00:02:41.380> yeah<00:02:41.440> these<00:02:41.620> should<00:02:41.950> all<00:02:42.100> grow<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.780> yeah

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
so yeah these should all grow and yeah

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.830 
so yeah these should all grow and yeah
basically<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.460> want<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.240> for<00:02:46.630> two

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
basically you want this here for two

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.890 
basically you want this here for two
reasons<00:02:47.350> I'm<00:02:47.710> not<00:02:47.820> sure<00:02:48.850> first<00:02:49.300> reason<00:02:49.630> I'm

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
reasons I'm not sure first reason I'm

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.390 
reasons I'm not sure first reason I'm
not<00:02:50.140> particularly<00:02:50.530> sure<00:02:50.770> about<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
not particularly sure about this but I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.060 
not particularly sure about this but I
think<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.060> helps<00:02:52.320> I'm<00:02:53.320> not<00:02:53.530> sure<00:02:53.710> about<00:02:53.770> light

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
think it helps I'm not sure about light

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.560 
think it helps I'm not sure about light
level<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.580> trees<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.910> don't<00:02:55.180> know<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:55.390> that's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
level for trees I don't know if that's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.860 
level for trees I don't know if that's
still<00:02:55.900> something<00:02:56.200> within<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.710> game<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.840> I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
still something within the game but I

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.480 
still something within the game but I
think<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.440> generally<00:02:59.800> it's<00:03:00.100> useful<00:03:00.459> to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
think it just generally it's useful to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.949 
think it just generally it's useful to
have<00:03:00.580> like<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:00.940> plus<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.480> don't<00:03:01.570> want<00:03:01.780> mob

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
have like that plus you don't want mob

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.290 
have like that plus you don't want mob
spawn<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.650> blowing<00:03:02.950> everything<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.490> and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
spawn in here blowing everything up and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.850 
spawn in here blowing everything up and
then<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.690> few<00:03:04.840> tips<00:03:05.080> for<00:03:05.350> actually

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
then just a few tips for actually

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.160 
then just a few tips for actually
growing<00:03:06.370> these<00:03:06.520> if<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.540> are<00:03:07.660> gonna<00:03:07.810> be<00:03:07.900> bone

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
growing these if you are gonna be bone

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.600 
growing these if you are gonna be bone
milling<00:03:08.560> them<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.830> want<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> boat<00:03:09.220> meal<00:03:09.400> from

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
milling them you want a boat meal from

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.310 
milling them you want a boat meal from
the<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.910> from<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> center<00:03:10.870> outwards

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
the in from the center outwards

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
the in from the center outwards
otherwise<00:03:11.680> you're<00:03:11.830> gonna<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.130> trapped<00:03:12.430> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
otherwise you're gonna get trapped and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.760 
otherwise you're gonna get trapped and
also<00:03:13.810> if<00:03:13.959> when<00:03:14.110> you're<00:03:14.230> planting<00:03:14.560> them<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
also if when you're planting them you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.900 
also if when you're planting them you
want<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.980> plant<00:03:15.130> them<00:03:15.190> from<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.489> inside

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
want to plant them from the inside

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390 
want to plant them from the inside
outwards<00:03:16.300> that's<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.690> another<00:03:16.870> tip<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.400> yeah

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
outwards that's just another tip so yeah

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.449 
outwards that's just another tip so yeah
that's<00:03:18.760> basically<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.739> all<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.220> need

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
that's basically it all you really need

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.570 
that's basically it all you really need
you<00:03:21.640> could<00:03:21.820> build<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.330> decent<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.770> video<00:03:24.040> you

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
you could build a decent this video you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.160 
you could build a decent this video you
could<00:03:24.700> build<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.000> decent-sized<00:03:25.630> one<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:26.020> these

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
could build a decent-sized one of these

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.290 
could build a decent-sized one of these
with<00:03:28.320> stack<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.470> saplings<00:03:29.709> stack<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.850> dirt<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
with stack of saplings stack of dirt and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.000 
with stack of saplings stack of dirt and
just<00:03:32.170> less<00:03:32.350> than<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.590> stack<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.860> less<00:03:35.980> than

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
just less than a stack of just less than

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.550 
just less than a stack of just less than
a<00:03:36.190> stack<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.640> torches<00:03:37.390> basically<00:03:37.900> now<00:03:38.320> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
a stack of torches basically now this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.720 
a stack of torches basically now this
can<00:03:38.770> be<00:03:38.800> paid<00:03:39.070> out<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.310> anything<00:03:39.580> I'm<00:03:39.700> just

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
can be paid out of anything I'm just

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.229 
can be paid out of anything I'm just
about<00:03:40.000> out<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.270> stone<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.650> show

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
about out of stone just it's just a show

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.520 
about out of stone just it's just a show
but<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.450> could<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.720> built<00:03:43.989> out<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.170> dirt

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
but this could be built out of dirt

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.830 
but this could be built out of dirt
honestly<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.130> mean<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.459> could<00:03:45.610> build

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
honestly I mean you could build

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.759 
honestly I mean you could build
perfectly<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:46.959> way<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.140> do<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
perfectly it's way to do this is to

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.289 
perfectly it's way to do this is to
build<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.340> ground<00:03:48.370> that's<00:03:48.970> basically

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
build it on the ground that's basically

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.030 
build it on the ground that's basically
what<00:03:49.570> I'm<00:03:49.720> gonna<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:50.019> using<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.950> my

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
what I'm gonna be using for in one of my

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.830 
what I'm gonna be using for in one of my
series<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.970> I'll<00:03:52.209> be<00:03:52.330> coming<00:03:52.540> up<00:03:52.630> soon

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
series is and I'll be coming up soon

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.860 
series is and I'll be coming up soon
guys<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.760> know<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.570> really<00:03:55.750> good

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870

guys but you know it's a really good
thing<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.170> borrow<00:03:56.410> underground<00:03:56.769> because<00:03:56.890> this

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
thing to borrow underground because this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.580 
thing to borrow underground because this
is<00:03:57.370> essentially<00:03:57.820> just<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:59.019> roof<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.410> don't

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
is essentially just a roof you don't

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.750 
is essentially just a roof you don't
even<00:03:59.709> need<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.340> doesn't<00:04:00.549> need<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.730> be

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
even need to it doesn't need to be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.310 
even need to it doesn't need to be
floating<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.360> can<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:01.630> be<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.870> roof<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
floating it can just be the roof of the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.410 
floating it can just be the roof of the
cave<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.519> then<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.820> could<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.180> built

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
cave and then this could just be built

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.660 
cave and then this could just be built
on<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> ground<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:04.959> really<00:04:05.200> efficient<00:04:05.670> farm

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
on the ground it's really efficient farm

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.949 
on the ground it's really efficient farm
for<00:04:06.850> underground<00:04:07.299> that's<00:04:07.540> basically<00:04:07.810> what

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
for underground that's basically what

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.509 
for underground that's basically what
this<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.320> be<00:04:08.410> be<00:04:08.860> used<00:04:09.100> for<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.400> will

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
this is going to be be used for you will

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.729 
this is going to be be used for you will
really<00:04:09.670> want<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.239> above<00:04:10.690> ground<00:04:10.930> it's

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
really want to do this above ground it's

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.229 
really want to do this above ground it's
a<00:04:11.769> really<00:04:12.010> good<00:04:12.160> underground<00:04:12.640> farm<00:04:12.910> obviously
