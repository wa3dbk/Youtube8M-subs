bush<00:03:26.650> no<00:03:26.829> ban<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> drop<00:03:27.850> reticle<00:03:28.620> but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
bush no ban with the drop reticle but

bush no ban with the drop reticle but
other<00:03:30.430> than<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.720> far<00:03:32.639> it's<00:03:33.639> turned<00:03:33.910> out

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
other than that so far it's turned out

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.440 
other than that so far it's turned out
really<00:03:34.180> well

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
really well

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.330 
really well
now<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.139> just<00:03:35.200> got<00:03:35.470> ahead<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.859> range<00:03:36.069> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
now I just got ahead to the range and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.210 
now I just got ahead to the range and
see<00:03:37.090> what<00:03:37.239> she<00:03:37.359> actually<00:03:37.660> groups<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.160> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
see what she actually groups do have a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.710 
see what she actually groups do have a
couple<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.519> different<00:03:39.790> loads<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.269> try<00:03:40.450> out<00:03:40.599> of

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
couple of different loads to try out of

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.090 
couple of different loads to try out of
it<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.430> got<00:03:42.870> some<00:03:43.870> v-max

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.410 

19.8<00:03:51.810> 20.8<00:03:54.150> 21.9<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.620> then<00:03:56.770> I<00:03:56.890> got<00:03:57.100> some<00:03:57.420> 75

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
19.8 20.8 21.9 and then I got some 75

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.740 
19.8 20.8 21.9 and then I got some 75
grain<00:03:58.780> or<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.920> match<00:04:00.190> also<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.180> try<00:04:01.480> out<00:04:01.660> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
grain or in a match also to try out of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.820 
grain or in a match also to try out of
it<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:04.660> some<00:04:04.860> 4064<00:04:05.860> some<00:04:06.250> 21<00:04:06.700> gram<00:04:06.970> 22<00:04:07.600> 23<00:04:08.290> 24

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
it with some 4064 some 21 gram 22 23 24

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.190 
it with some 4064 some 21 gram 22 23 24
8<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.200> all<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.440> doesn't<00:04:11.980> work<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:13.200> just

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
8 and if all that doesn't work I just

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.830 
8 and if all that doesn't work I just
use<00:04:14.350> my<00:04:14.380> standard<00:04:14.800> Full<00:04:15.760> Metal<00:04:15.910> Jacket<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:18.840> all

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
use my standard Full Metal Jacket so all

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.040 
use my standard Full Metal Jacket so all
right<00:04:20.019> we'll<00:04:20.590> see<00:04:20.829> how<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.010> goes
