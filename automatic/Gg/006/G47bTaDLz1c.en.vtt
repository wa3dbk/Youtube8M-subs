modern jazz quartet so just the prelude
I<00:01:28.900> think<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.620> beautiful<00:01:30.040> enough<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.790> warrant

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
I think is beautiful enough to warrant

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.950 
I think is beautiful enough to warrant
just<00:01:31.780> being<00:01:32.050> its<00:01:32.200> own<00:01:32.530> little<00:01:32.890> song<00:01:33.700> at<00:01:34.690> this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
just being its own little song at this

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.910 
just being its own little song at this
point<00:01:35.290> what<00:01:35.530> happens<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.220> they<00:01:36.400> break<00:01:36.700> into

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
point what happens is they break into

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940 
point what happens is they break into
some<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:40.360> know<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.780> much<00:01:41.140> faster<00:01:41.380> tempo

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
some you know and are much faster tempo

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.530 
some you know and are much faster tempo
if<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.580> listen<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> recording<00:01:43.420> they

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
if you listen to the recording they

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540 
if you listen to the recording they
break<00:01:43.780> into<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.110> call<00:01:44.410> set<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> completely

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
break into a call set a completely

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.140 
break into a call set a completely
different<00:01:45.700> changes<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.540> they<00:01:47.200> do<00:01:47.260> a<00:01:48.060> bunch<00:01:49.060> of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
different changes and they do a bunch of

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.280 
different changes and they do a bunch of
soloing<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.310> then<00:01:52.090> they<00:01:52.300> end<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.720> song<00:01:52.960> with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
soloing but then they end the song with

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.160 
soloing but then they end the song with
the<00:01:53.470> prelude<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.479> song<00:01:55.750> as<00:01:55.930> the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
the prelude so it's the song as the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.510 
the prelude so it's the song as the
actual<00:01:56.500> song<00:01:56.740> has<00:01:56.950> got<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> few<00:01:57.340> different

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
actual song has got a few different

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.700 
actual song has got a few different
sections<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:59.460> but<00:02:00.540> again<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.320> just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
sections in it but again this is just

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.830 
sections in it but again this is just
the<00:02:02.979> prelude<00:02:03.460> at<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.610> beginning<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the prelude at the beginning of it the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.000 
the prelude at the beginning of it the
bass<00:02:05.050> section<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:08.229> it's<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.500> pretty

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
bass section and I think it's a pretty

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.550 
bass section and I think it's a pretty
song<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.790> very<00:02:10.149> rich<00:02:10.540> melodically<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
song it's very rich melodically and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.000 
song it's very rich melodically and
harmonically<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.990> what<00:02:13.990> I've<00:02:14.290> tried<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.740> do

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
harmonically and what I've tried to do

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000 
harmonically and what I've tried to do
is<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.430> write<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.390> out<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> could<00:02:17.950> be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is just write it out so it could be

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.250 
is just write it out so it could be
played<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> group<00:02:19.150> even<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> boss<00:02:20.020> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
played with a group even as a boss and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
played with a group even as a boss and
over<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> good<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:32.519> think<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.790> pretty<00:02:34.030> enough

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
over you good I think it's pretty enough

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.949 
over you good I think it's pretty enough
to<00:02:34.570> do<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:37.120> what<00:02:37.780> we're<00:02:37.930> going

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
to do it like that but what we're going

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.870 
to do it like that but what we're going
to<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.590> lesson<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.459> we're<00:02:39.760> gonna

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
to do with this lesson is we're gonna

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020 
to do with this lesson is we're gonna
learn<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.510> prelude<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:41.470> sometime<00:02:42.040> in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
learn this prelude and then sometime in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.720 
learn this prelude and then sometime in
the<00:02:43.209> future<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:45.010> work<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the future we are going to work on the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
the future we are going to work on the
rest<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.239> maybe<00:02:46.480> work<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.900> Joe's<00:02:47.230> solo

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
rest of it maybe work on Joe's solo

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.810 
rest of it maybe work on Joe's solo
something<00:02:48.160> like<00:02:48.310> that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
something like that

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.050 
something like that
so<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.100> take<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.280> listen<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> song<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
so if you take a listen to the song and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.270 
so if you take a listen to the song and
list<00:02:52.390> make<00:02:52.600> sure<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.900> listen<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.590> Joe<00:02:54.070> pass
