00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and land on its little gear so made some

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
and land on its little gear so made some

best<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:32.310> cut<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> pieces<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.119> glue

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
best then cut out the pieces and glue

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
best then cut out the pieces and glue
them<00:01:33.570> together<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:34.079> normal<00:01:34.439> Elmer's<00:01:34.740> glue

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
them together with normal Elmer's glue

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
them together with normal Elmer's glue
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.210> tape<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> glue<00:01:36.869> them

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you can also use tape to glue them

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
you can also use tape to glue them
together<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.560> making<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> larger<00:01:38.250> or

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
together if you're making a larger or

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
together if you're making a larger or
thicker<00:01:38.640> version<00:01:38.880> large<00:01:39.540> black<00:01:39.810> squares

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
thicker version large black squares

Arno's<00:01:40.500> wait<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:41.040> act<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.520> engine<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
Arno's wait they act like the engine and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.460 
Arno's wait they act like the engine and
should<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> folded<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.750> underneath<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.290> red

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
should be folded up underneath the red

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
should be folded up underneath the red
engine<00:01:43.649> cowling<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.280> changing<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> amount

engine cowling and changing the amount

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
engine cowling and changing the amount
of<00:01:45.540> nose<00:01:45.689> weight<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.439> help<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> fly

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
of nose weight can actually help the fly

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
of nose weight can actually help the fly
better<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.430> experiment<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.600> fun

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
better so experiment with it have fun

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
better so experiment with it have fun
and<00:01:49.170> stay<00:01:49.619> tuned<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.250> aircraft<00:01:50.460> from
