00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 from Brittany we came al gore or 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 you see it rock is always 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.460
 trembling 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 on the other hand the leader the Austrian mourning 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.859
 from him he did not shake at all 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 today at the care at work there hard 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 hard also the circuit of this against the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 shows drawn in the forest of huelgoat 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 is hard to resist the Dutch 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.840
 dylan selling bar is needed at the wat to more 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 average 46 km hour 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 but the duel that interested the whole 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 world opposed the first two of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 general before departure only one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.480
 second separated the Austrian eisel from 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.820
 Dutch van der licha but ricardo 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 last seidl to rush did not fail 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.789
 from the first kilometers in the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 difficulty of the circuit 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.350
 the Austrian took time out of his 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 second party two minutes earlier even 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 if he does not win the stage he consolidates 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 his first place overall and counts 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.809
 now 42 seconds of advanced van 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 der licha the day of the coronation of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.589
 their new king the dutch ensures 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 that they will try everything tomorrow on the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.470
 last step all tempted to dethrone 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.030
 heusen today at huelgoat at 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.950
 the occasion of this time trial we 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 have also decided to follow one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 brave runners from the team of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.409
 brittany since the beginning of this round he 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.970
 shows every day the jersey while 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 repeating his scales before the clock 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.479
 fabrice day lord of the selection 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.799
 brittany already has in the head the good 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.799
 recipe to make a difference 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.070
 but here it is today is really the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.740
 pressure cut back in May that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.530
 will not be ready for any reason 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.180
 on the week the team showed the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.799
 jersey with an obvious desire to 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.170
 do well then today not 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.890
 question of derogating from the rule under consideration 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.420
 do not leave in the car 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.399
 frederic guesdon who is at the maneuver 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.560
 and in the difficult passages 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.310
 the former winner of paris roubaix 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.899
 charge to give the tempo and expensive 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.549
 but the course is demanding cut 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.069
 for specialists last 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.020
 kilometers are made to the fabrice mind is 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.060
 in the end a little disappointed with his time without 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.619
 to have yet unworthy but to make a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 little bit better still physically 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.929
 it's not very precise 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 I was a little behind the wheel 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.810
 today I think the week with 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.700
 duras to finish 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.769
 and yet Frederic Guesdon feeds 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.569
 willingly some ambitions for the 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.549
 last step of 2 me one has to believe 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.140
 that they go pretty fast in board bosses 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.890
 it's a bumpy finish so we 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.890
 hope to the end 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.600
 Austrian ricardo zoyd so she 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.890
 widened the gap with respect to 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.500
 pursuers overall rankings but 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.320
 attention tomorrow last step very 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.240
 special as is the case on the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.980
 famous too few nails 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.050
 trails will be on the riders' menu this 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.030
 wednesday in the black mountains between 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.590
 FinistÃ¨re and Morbihan 3 long way 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.660
 could allow attackers to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.860
 upset the hierarchy for the most 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.030
 great joy of the spectators and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.160
 riparian but one side has one more side 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.160
 far this taste change from here to live have 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.320
 gone there no it's fine here in front of 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.390
 we on the side of the organizers 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.740
 wanted to innovate surprise 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.690
 goal achieved it's going to be a first 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.810
 for us to borrow a pie 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.340
 a little bit special and unusual 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.470
 for a race and after I had the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.750
 otters it's going to be hard very hard 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.100
 but still I think it's up to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.010
 something else knows it's 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.220
 awesome yeah last step of the turn of 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.350
 Brittany Wednesday 141 km between a 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.470
 box and quimperlÃ© big show in 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.470
 perspective
