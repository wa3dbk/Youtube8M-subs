get<00:01:40.469> started<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.189> us<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
get started could you give us all the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
get started could you give us all the
history<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.909> word<00:01:42.210> sharp<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.689> started

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
history and word sharp can get started

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
history and word sharp can get started
oh<00:01:43.200> yeah<00:01:43.680> they'll<00:01:43.860> take<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.039> couple<00:01:44.219> minutes

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
oh yeah they'll take a couple minutes

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.520 
oh yeah they'll take a couple minutes
set<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.789> some<00:01:44.969> some<00:01:45.689> stuff<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.110> we'll<00:01:46.350> get

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
set up some some stuff and we'll get

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
set up some some stuff and we'll get
right<00:01:46.649> into<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> okay<00:01:47.399> okay<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.719> whole

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
right into it okay okay the the whole

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
right into it okay okay the the whole
history<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.439> knives<00:01:49.799> goes<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> long<00:01:50.759> way

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
history of knives goes back a long way

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.569 
history of knives goes back a long way
before<00:01:51.539> we<00:01:51.689> had<00:01:51.869> fire<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:53.159> were<00:01:53.310> cutting

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
before we had fire we were cutting

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
before we had fire we were cutting
things<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.719> a<00:01:54.750> knife<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.530> man's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
things so a knife is actually man's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.690 
things so a knife is actually man's
oldest<00:01:56.640> tool<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.719> started<00:01:58.469> back<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.609> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
oldest tool they started back in the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.929 
oldest tool they started back in the
Stone<00:01:59.969> Age<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.740> using<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:01.979> hard<00:02:02.310> rocks

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
Stone Age with using very hard rocks

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
Stone Age with using very hard rocks
essentially<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> piece<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> Flint<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
essentially this is a piece of Flint and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
essentially this is a piece of Flint and
the<00:02:05.579> way<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:05.880> created<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.479> edge<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:07.320> by

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the way they created the edge was by

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.650 
the way they created the edge was by
applying<00:02:07.890> pressure<00:02:08.070> with<00:02:08.550> another<00:02:08.970> rock<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
applying pressure with another rock and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
applying pressure with another rock and
actually<00:02:10.530> flaking<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.490> Beast<00:02:11.670> pieces<00:02:12.210> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
actually flaking off the Beast pieces of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960 
actually flaking off the Beast pieces of
Flint<00:02:12.770> what<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.920> end<00:02:14.100> up<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> sharp

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
Flint what you end up with is a sharp

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820 
Flint what you end up with is a sharp
edge<00:02:15.210> which<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:15.690> used<00:02:15.870> for<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.530> cutting

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
edge which they used for for cutting

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.310 
edge which they used for for cutting
things<00:02:17.070> however<00:02:17.730> once<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.360> edge<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:19.020> gone

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
things however once the edge was gone

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.620 
things however once the edge was gone
they<00:02:20.100> had<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.580> go<00:02:20.700> back<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.120> knife<00:02:21.300> maker

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
they had to go back to the knife maker

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.290 
they had to go back to the knife maker
and<00:02:21.990> recreate<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> edge<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.400> sharpen<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and recreate the edge or sharpen it and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
and recreate the edge or sharpen it and
the<00:02:24.750> way<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.050> sharpened<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> way

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the way they sharpened it was the way

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.559 
the way they sharpened it was the way
they<00:02:26.159> made<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.519> original<00:02:26.909> life<00:02:27.090> was<00:02:27.360> by

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
they made the original life was by

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.809 
they made the original life was by
flaking<00:02:28.050> off<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
flaking off the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.239 
flaking off the
drock's<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.319> sharpening<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.219> the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:31.249 
drock's but but the sharpening of the

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.309 
drock's but but the sharpening of the
knife<00:02:31.519> was<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.879> critical<00:02:32.359> part<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.780> even<00:02:33.049> having

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
knife was a critical part of even having

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.910 
knife was a critical part of even having
won<00:02:33.680> another<00:02:34.549> example<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.689> here<00:02:36.109> these<00:02:36.680> are

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
won another example is here these are

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.170 
won another example is here these are
from<00:02:37.730> Kodiak<00:02:38.120> Island<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:39.319> Alaska<00:02:39.439> their

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
from Kodiak Island in Alaska their

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
from Kodiak Island in Alaska their
predecessors<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.329> lose<00:02:41.719> this<00:02:42.409> is<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.769> cutting

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
predecessors to lose this is the cutting

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.979 
predecessors to lose this is the cutting
edge<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.969> is<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> way<00:02:44.389> they<00:02:44.540> were<00:02:44.599> held

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
edge and this is the way they were held

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.649 
edge and this is the way they were held
and<00:02:45.290> they<00:02:45.799> use<00:02:46.010> them<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.969> skinning<00:02:47.480> animals

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
and they use them for skinning animals

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.020 
and they use them for skinning animals
or<00:02:48.230> scraping<00:02:48.560> or<00:02:48.980> cutting<00:02:49.370> food

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
or scraping or cutting food

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.990 
or scraping or cutting food
however<00:02:50.450> again<00:02:50.659> once<00:02:51.139> the<00:02:51.319> edge<00:02:51.469> was<00:02:51.680> gone

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
however again once the edge was gone

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.550 
however again once the edge was gone
they<00:02:53.000> needed<00:02:53.359> a<00:02:53.450> sharpening<00:02:53.930> stone<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.439> it's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
they needed a sharpening stone and it's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.050 
they needed a sharpening stone and it's
funny<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.859> these<00:02:55.129> three<00:02:55.430> pieces<00:02:55.639> were<00:02:55.909> all

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
funny that these three pieces were all

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.509 
funny that these three pieces were all
dug<00:02:56.359> up<00:02:56.510> together<00:02:56.719> out<00:02:57.139> of<00:02:57.260> an<00:02:57.379> old<00:02:57.500> dig<00:02:57.859> and

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
dug up together out of an old dig and

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.750 
dug up together out of an old dig and
the<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.359> this<00:02:59.659> rather<00:03:00.019> than<00:03:00.260> flaking<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.950> what

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
the and this rather than flaking it what

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.580 
the and this rather than flaking it what
they<00:03:01.909> did<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.239> they<00:03:02.389> used<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:02.780> harder<00:03:03.200> stone

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
they did is they used the harder stone

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.390 
they did is they used the harder stone
to<00:03:04.400> actually<00:03:05.180> remove<00:03:05.629> part<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.650> slate<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
to actually remove part of the slate and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.849 
to actually remove part of the slate and
so<00:03:07.639> they<00:03:07.790> created<00:03:08.269> their<00:03:08.629> edge<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.319> way<00:03:09.590> and

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
so they created their edge this way and

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.740 
so they created their edge this way and
the<00:03:10.370> edge<00:03:10.519> could<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:10.909> created<00:03:11.419> up<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.719> a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the edge could be created up to a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.009 
the edge could be created up to a
certain<00:03:12.079> point<00:03:12.949> but<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.849> angle<00:03:14.329> which<00:03:14.840> was

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
certain point but the angle which was

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.500 
certain point but the angle which was
very<00:03:15.230> difficult<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.919> maintain<00:03:16.180> took<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.209> fair

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
very difficult to maintain took a fair

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
very difficult to maintain took a fair
amount<00:03:17.599> of<00:03:17.900> skill<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.590> even<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.430> modern<00:03:19.669> days

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
amount of skill and even in modern days

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.720 
amount of skill and even in modern days
we<00:03:20.419> use<00:03:20.919> natural<00:03:21.919> stones<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.519> an

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
we use natural stones this is an

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.720 
we use natural stones this is an
Arkansas<00:03:23.269> stone<00:03:23.629> it's<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.500> piece<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.040> Novak<00:03:25.549> you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
Arkansas stone it's a piece of Novak you

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.729 
Arkansas stone it's a piece of Novak you
light<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.780> quite<00:03:27.019> hard<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:27.500> harder

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
light and it's quite hard it's harder

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.530 
light and it's quite hard it's harder
than<00:03:27.769> any<00:03:28.010> metal<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:28.699> they<00:03:28.849> can<00:03:29.060> use<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.389> to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
than any metal and so they can use it to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.929 
than any metal and so they can use it to
remove<00:03:29.870> metal<00:03:30.169> but<00:03:30.889> again<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.310> still<00:03:31.609> had<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
remove metal but again you still had to

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.020 
remove metal but again you still had to
maintain<00:03:32.419> your<00:03:32.569> angle<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:34.009> if<00:03:34.609> you<00:03:34.879> were

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
maintain your angle so if you were

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.080 
maintain your angle so if you were
sharpening<00:03:35.629> this<00:03:36.109> way<00:03:36.409> if<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:37.430> change<00:03:37.849> your

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
sharpening this way if you change your

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.059 
sharpening this way if you change your
angle<00:03:38.419> even<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.780> little<00:03:38.930> bit<00:03:39.259> it<00:03:39.500> changed<00:03:39.919> the

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
angle even a little bit it changed the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.369 
angle even a little bit it changed the
the<00:03:40.400> edge<00:03:40.720> which<00:03:41.720> made<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.109> even<00:03:42.229> more

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
the edge which made it even more

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.809 
the edge which made it even more
difficult<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.129> try<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.340> maintain<00:03:43.579> a

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
difficult to try to maintain a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.869 
difficult to try to maintain a
consistent<00:03:44.239> angle<00:03:44.599> so<00:03:45.169> consistency<00:03:45.889> became

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
consistent angle so consistency became

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.759 
consistent angle so consistency became
the<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.419> goal<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:48.189> about<00:03:49.189> 150<00:03:49.849> years<00:03:50.000> ago

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
the the goal and about 150 years ago

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.409 
the the goal and about 150 years ago
people<00:03:51.769> discovered<00:03:51.919> that<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.609> inside<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.329> a

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
people discovered that the inside of a

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.069 
people discovered that the inside of a
crock<00:03:53.689> pot<00:03:54.970> if<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.150> set<00:03:56.359> your<00:03:56.540> knife<00:03:56.689> in<00:03:56.930> there

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
crock pot if you set your knife in there

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.610 
crock pot if you set your knife in there
this<00:03:57.319> way<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:58.400> can<00:03:58.609> see<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:58.879> that<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.019> curve

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
this way you can see that that the curve

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.770 
this way you can see that that the curve
of<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.009> pod<00:04:01.250> actually<00:04:01.909> creates<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.540> consistent

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
of the pod actually creates a consistent

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.979 
of the pod actually creates a consistent
angle<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.799> by<00:04:04.370> running<00:04:04.549> your<00:04:04.909> knife<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.389> the

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
angle and by running your knife on the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.189 
angle and by running your knife on the
inside<00:04:06.409> of<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.650> pot<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:08.840> could<00:04:09.019> actually

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
inside of the pot you could actually

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.309 
inside of the pot you could actually
sharpen<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.159> edge<00:04:10.689> consistently<00:04:11.689> because

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
sharpen the edge consistently because

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.009 
sharpen the edge consistently because
the<00:04:12.530> crock<00:04:12.889> was<00:04:13.129> harder<00:04:13.519> than<00:04:13.729> the<00:04:14.389> steel<00:04:14.689> and

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
the crock was harder than the steel and

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.709 
the crock was harder than the steel and
you<00:04:15.799> could<00:04:15.979> actually<00:04:16.159> create<00:04:16.639> an<00:04:16.909> edge<00:04:17.120> now

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:17.719 
you could actually create an edge now

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.099 
you could actually create an edge now
this<00:04:17.930> concept<00:04:18.469> went<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.829> little<00:04:18.949> bit<00:04:19.190> further<00:04:19.519> a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
this concept went a little bit further a

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.450 
this concept went a little bit further a
man<00:04:21.109> named<00:04:21.320> Louie<00:04:21.590> graves<00:04:23.620> created<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:25.009> piece

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
man named Louie graves created a piece

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.149 
man named Louie graves created a piece
of<00:04:25.669> porcelain<00:04:26.509> very<00:04:27.110> much<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.770> only<00:04:28.009> a

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
of porcelain very much like this only a

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.450 
of porcelain very much like this only a
more<00:04:28.460> modern<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.259> and<00:04:30.259> the<00:04:30.590> v-shape<00:04:31.190> is

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
more modern and and the v-shape is

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.580 
more modern and and the v-shape is
designed<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.300> maintain<00:04:32.509> consistent<00:04:33.469> angle

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.459 
designed to maintain consistent angle
control<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.060> way<00:04:35.180> that's<00:04:35.360> done<00:04:35.539> is<00:04:36.020> if

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
control and the way that's done is if

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.070 
control and the way that's done is if
you<00:04:36.590> were<00:04:36.680> sharpening<00:04:37.219> this<00:04:37.430> way<00:04:37.779> let's<00:04:38.779> turn

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
you were sharpening this way let's turn

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.689 
you were sharpening this way let's turn
that<00:04:39.260> stone<00:04:39.560> up<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.889> little<00:04:40.070> bit<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.550> now<00:04:40.669> we

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
that stone up a little bit and now we

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.700 
that stone up a little bit and now we
keep<00:04:41.029> the<00:04:41.090> blade<00:04:41.360> straight<00:04:41.870> up<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.229> down

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
keep the blade straight up and down

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
keep the blade straight up and down
and<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.280> straight<00:04:43.580> up<00:04:43.759> and<00:04:43.940> down<00:04:44.000> visual<00:04:44.690> is

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
and the straight up and down visual is

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320 
and the straight up and down visual is
the<00:04:44.990> way<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.289> maintain<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.889> control<00:04:46.100> now<00:04:47.090> from

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
the way we maintain the control now from

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.870 
the way we maintain the control now from
the<00:04:47.419> early<00:04:47.720> seventies<00:04:48.229> on<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.440> whole<00:04:48.850> slew<00:04:49.850> of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
various kinds of e sharpeners came into

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.430 
various kinds of e sharpeners came into
production<00:04:52.780> eventually<00:04:53.780> ending<00:04:54.080> up<00:04:54.229> with

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
production eventually ending up with

production eventually ending up with
this<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:55.009> is<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.310> triangle<00:04:55.850> Sharpe<00:04:56.090> maker

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
this this is the triangle Sharpe maker

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.480 
this this is the triangle Sharpe maker
the<00:04:56.539> one<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.870> we<00:04:56.960> produce<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.680> it's

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
the one that we produce and it's

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.760 
the one that we produce and it's
probably<00:04:58.759> the<00:04:59.030> most<00:04:59.150> sophisticated<00:04:59.600> and<00:05:00.289> the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
probably the most sophisticated and the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.439 
probably the most sophisticated and the
most<00:05:00.949> versatile<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.699> sharpeners<00:05:02.210> on<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
most versatile of the sharpeners on the

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.430 
most versatile of the sharpeners on the
market<00:05:02.810> today<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.380> again<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.580> technique<00:05:05.440> is

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
market today and again the technique is

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.990 
market today and again the technique is
keeping<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.039> blade<00:05:07.250> straight<00:05:07.550> up<00:05:07.759> and<00:05:07.940> down

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
keeping the blade straight up and down

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.090 
keeping the blade straight up and down
and<00:05:08.509> I'll<00:05:08.900> show<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.169> how<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.470> do<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.009> a

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
and I'll show you how to do that in a

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.980 
and I'll show you how to do that in a
few<00:05:10.310> minutes<00:05:10.639> but<00:05:11.090> it's<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.449> edge<00:05:11.600> that<00:05:11.870> we're

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
few minutes but it's the edge that we're

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.040 
few minutes but it's the edge that we're
concerned<00:05:12.380> with<00:05:12.620> with<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.860> knife<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:14.870> there's

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
concerned with with a knife now there's

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.230 
concerned with with a knife now there's
a<00:05:15.110> variety<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.650> different<00:05:16.099> kinds<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:16.639> grinds

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
a variety of different kinds of grinds

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.980 
a variety of different kinds of grinds
that<00:05:17.750> they'll<00:05:18.020> use<00:05:18.289> to<00:05:18.320> create<00:05:18.800> an<00:05:19.130> edge

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
that they'll use to create an edge

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.050 
that they'll use to create an edge
there's<00:05:20.990> four<00:05:21.349> basic<00:05:21.620> grinds<00:05:22.370> when<00:05:22.910> it's

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
there's four basic grinds when it's

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.029 
there's four basic grinds when it's
called<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.360> hollow<00:05:23.599> grind<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.320> that's<00:05:24.860> where

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
called a hollow grind and that's where

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.950 
called a hollow grind and that's where
they<00:05:25.160> take<00:05:25.370> your<00:05:25.580> basic<00:05:25.759> piece<00:05:26.150> of<00:05:26.330> steel<00:05:26.630> and

they take your basic piece of steel and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.140 
they take your basic piece of steel and
using<00:05:27.620> two<00:05:27.830> wheels<00:05:28.160> they<00:05:28.490> hollow<00:05:28.849> out<00:05:29.000> a

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
using two wheels they hollow out a

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.810 
using two wheels they hollow out a
portion<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> hollow<00:05:31.130> grind<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:31.729> you

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
portion this is a hollow grind and you

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.909 
portion this is a hollow grind and you
can<00:05:32.000> see<00:05:32.240> where<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:33.169> steel<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.740> actually

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
can see where the the steel is actually

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.420 
can see where the the steel is actually
hollowed<00:05:34.639> out<00:05:34.789> on<00:05:35.060> both<00:05:35.419> sides<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:37.130> that's

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
hollowed out on both sides and that's

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.969 
hollowed out on both sides and that's
how<00:05:37.699> you<00:05:37.759> end<00:05:37.880> up<00:05:38.180> with<00:05:38.389> an<00:05:38.539> edge<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:39.110> second

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
how you end up with an edge a second

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.469 
how you end up with an edge a second
type<00:05:40.160> of<00:05:40.370> edge<00:05:40.520> would<00:05:40.729> be<00:05:40.849> called<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.210> flat

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
type of edge would be called a flat

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.510 
type of edge would be called a flat
grind<00:05:41.840> and<00:05:42.139> that's<00:05:42.710> where<00:05:42.889> you<00:05:43.009> start<00:05:43.070> at<00:05:43.430> the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
grind and that's where you start at the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.550 
grind and that's where you start at the
top<00:05:43.729> and<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:44.240> go<00:05:44.720> straight<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.410> edge

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
top and you just go straight to the edge

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.000 
top and you just go straight to the edge
it's<00:05:46.370> easier<00:05:46.729> to<00:05:46.849> see<00:05:47.229> coming<00:05:48.229> down<00:05:48.500> one<00:05:48.770> side

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
it's easier to see coming down one side

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.490 
it's easier to see coming down one side
and<00:05:49.310> down<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.520> other<00:05:49.669> a<00:05:50.210> third<00:05:51.199> type<00:05:51.470> which

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
and down the other a third type which

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.250 
and down the other a third type which
isn't<00:05:51.860> use<00:05:52.099> much<00:05:52.340> anymore<00:05:52.580> it's<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.360> it's<00:05:54.050> a

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
isn't use much anymore it's a it's a

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.490 
isn't use much anymore it's a it's a
double<00:05:55.190> convex<00:05:55.880> grind<00:05:56.240> where<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.930> come

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
double convex grind where you come

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.070 
double convex grind where you come
around<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.070> way<00:05:58.510> sometimes<00:05:59.510> it's<00:05:59.720> called<00:05:59.930> an

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
around this way sometimes it's called an

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.140 
around this way sometimes it's called an
apple<00:06:00.440> seed<00:06:00.650> grind<00:06:01.010> because<00:06:01.220> of<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.669> actual

shape back in Japan they they used to

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.279 
shape back in Japan they they used to

call it Hama goodI BA 800 AD it's how

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.649 
call it Hama goodI BA 800 AD it's how
far<00:06:09.560> back<00:06:09.710> this<00:06:09.979> goes<00:06:10.039> but<00:06:10.789> in<00:06:10.909> all<00:06:11.060> cases<00:06:11.300> what

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
far back this goes but in all cases what

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.320 
far back this goes but in all cases what
you're<00:06:11.840> trying<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.259> do<00:06:12.409> is<00:06:12.560> get<00:06:12.680> to<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.979> edge

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
you're trying to do is get to the edge

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.089 
you're trying to do is get to the edge
there's<00:06:14.330> another<00:06:14.599> type<00:06:14.930> that's<00:06:15.680> been<00:06:15.919> used

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
there's another type that's been used

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.740 
there's another type that's been used
quite<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.400> bit<00:06:16.520> recently<00:06:16.880> they<00:06:17.300> call<00:06:17.539> it<00:06:17.690> a

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
quite a bit recently they call it a

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.839 
quite a bit recently they call it a
chisel<00:06:18.169> grind<00:06:18.199> but<00:06:18.680> this<00:06:19.190> is<00:06:19.370> again<00:06:19.610> been

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
chisel grind but this is again been

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.730 
chisel grind but this is again been
around<00:06:20.060> for<00:06:20.330> many<00:06:20.449> years<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:21.349> learners<00:06:21.710> that

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
around for many years the learners that

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.249 
around for many years the learners that
on<00:06:22.039> one<00:06:22.220> side<00:06:22.250> is<00:06:22.729> flat<00:06:23.000> or<00:06:23.389> sometimes<00:06:23.840> even<00:06:24.199> a

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
on one side is flat or sometimes even a

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.589 
on one side is flat or sometimes even a
little<00:06:24.289> Hollow<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:25.190> the<00:06:25.729> other<00:06:25.880> side<00:06:26.210> it's

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
little Hollow and the other side it's

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.379 
little Hollow and the other side it's
actually<00:06:27.020> comes<00:06:27.889> in<00:06:28.070> this<00:06:28.220> way<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:29.030> you<00:06:29.120> have

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
actually comes in this way so you have

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.290 
actually comes in this way so you have
the<00:06:29.690> grind<00:06:30.169> is<00:06:30.409> just<00:06:30.650> on<00:06:30.830> one<00:06:31.070> side<00:06:31.400> so<00:06:32.090> what's

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
the grind is just on one side so what's

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.550 
the grind is just on one side so what's
the<00:06:32.419> point<00:06:32.570> of<00:06:32.750> having<00:06:32.810> different<00:06:33.080> grinds

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
the point of having different grinds

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.990 
the point of having different grinds
they're<00:06:33.710> just<00:06:33.919> different<00:06:34.220> ways<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.669> getting

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
they're just different ways of getting

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.379 
they're just different ways of getting
to<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.300> edge<00:06:35.590> in<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:37.159> case<00:06:37.370> of<00:06:37.669> a<00:06:37.699> chopping

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
to the edge in the case of a chopping

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.540 
to the edge in the case of a chopping
tool<00:06:38.740> that's<00:06:39.740> where<00:06:39.979> you<00:06:40.099> would<00:06:40.250> want<00:06:40.430> that

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
tool that's where you would want that

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.490 
tool that's where you would want that
apple<00:06:41.030> seed<00:06:41.270> grind<00:06:41.539> like<00:06:41.810> on<00:06:41.990> a<00:06:42.020> hatchet

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
apple seed grind like on a hatchet

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.800 
apple seed grind like on a hatchet
you'll<00:06:42.800> find<00:06:43.039> most<00:06:43.220> hatchets<00:06:43.759> are<00:06:43.940> done<00:06:44.570> that

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
you'll find most hatchets are done that

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.749 
you'll find most hatchets are done that
way<00:06:44.960> so<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.259> can<00:06:45.500> have<00:06:45.680> a<00:06:45.710> lot<00:06:45.949> of<00:06:45.979> meat<00:06:46.310> behind

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
way so you can have a lot of meat behind

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.640 
way so you can have a lot of meat behind
the<00:06:46.880> cutting<00:06:47.150> edge<00:06:47.419> so<00:06:48.050> it<00:06:48.199> doesn't<00:06:48.530> break

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
the cutting edge so it doesn't break

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.890 
the cutting edge so it doesn't break
down<00:06:48.789> the<00:06:49.789> hollow<00:06:50.000> grind<00:06:50.389> and<00:06:50.599> the<00:06:50.690> flat

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
down the hollow grind and the flat

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.129 
down the hollow grind and the flat
grinds<00:06:51.229> are<00:06:51.409> the<00:06:51.469> most<00:06:51.650> common<00:06:52.190> used<00:06:52.669> today

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
grinds are the most common used today

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.689 
grinds are the most common used today
they're<00:06:54.139> just<00:06:54.409> too<00:06:54.620> different

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
they're just too different

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.580 
they're just too different
two<00:06:56.210> different<00:06:56.629> solutions<00:06:56.780> to<00:06:57.229> the<00:06:57.409> same

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
two different solutions to the same

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.770 
two different solutions to the same
problem<00:06:57.650> almost<00:06:58.249> like<00:06:58.610> forging<00:06:59.090> Chevy's<00:06:59.539> they

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
problem almost like forging Chevy's they

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.140 
problem almost like forging Chevy's they
have<00:06:59.960> two<00:07:00.409> different<00:07:00.590> advantages<00:07:01.099> and<00:07:01.550> the

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
have two different advantages and the

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.209 
have two different advantages and the
the<00:07:02.479> advantage<00:07:02.930> of<00:07:03.050> a<00:07:03.439> chisel<00:07:03.830> grinder<00:07:04.189> a

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
the advantage of a chisel grinder a

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.339 
the advantage of a chisel grinder a
Catawba<00:07:04.669> grind<00:07:04.999> is<00:07:05.210> that<00:07:05.990> when<00:07:06.229> you're

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.349 
Catawba grind is that when you're

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:09.159 
Catawba grind is that when you're
cutting<00:07:06.590> food<00:07:07.120> this<00:07:08.120> part<00:07:08.449> gets<00:07:08.659> right<00:07:08.900> up<00:07:09.050> to

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
cutting food this part gets right up to

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.170 
cutting food this part gets right up to
the<00:07:09.289> part<00:07:09.529> you're<00:07:09.740> cutting<00:07:10.129> and<00:07:10.310> this<00:07:10.849> part

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180
