now there are many ways to actually

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.570 
now there are many ways to actually
simplify<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> complex<00:00:03.990> rational<00:00:04.620> expression<00:00:04.950> I

think<00:00:06.029> most<00:00:06.180> people<00:00:06.450> get<00:00:06.600> scared<00:00:06.720> with<00:00:06.990> this

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
think most people get scared with this

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.629 
think most people get scared with this
problem<00:00:07.379> because<00:00:07.620> they<00:00:07.830> see<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.040> fraction

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
problem because they see a fraction

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.129

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.260 
and the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> multiply<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.060> the

third power and a to the third power
this<00:00:20.880> will<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.510> allow<00:00:21.689> me<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.050> multiply<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this will then allow me to multiply this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
this will then allow me to multiply this
by<00:00:22.800> 2<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.480> by<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> numerators<00:00:26.990> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and for a to the fourth power you can

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
and for a to the fourth power you can
come<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.520> denominators<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> do

the<00:00:36.600> same<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.680> multiply<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.160> by

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the same thing if i multiply this by

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
the same thing if i multiply this by
three<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.969> by<00:00:39.210> three<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.530> have

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
three in this by three I would now have

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.160 
three in this by three I would now have
21<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.219> squared<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.510> only<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> match<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
21 a squared the only way to match that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
21 a squared the only way to match that
is<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> multiply<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> multiply

with there are several ways to work with
it<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.130> could<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.430> rewrite<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.060> such<00:01:51.360> as

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
it one you could just rewrite it such as

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.450 
it one you could just rewrite it such as
it<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.780> say<00:01:51.960> 10<00:01:52.350> minus<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.430> third

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it would say 10 minus a to the third

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.209 
it would say 10 minus a to the third
power<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.149> top<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> fourth<00:01:55.890> and

power on top of for a to the fourth and
then<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> could<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> right

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
then what you could do is just right

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
then what you could do is just right
divide<00:01:59.899> 6<00:02:00.899> plus<00:02:01.170> 5a<00:02:01.710> over<00:02:02.250> 21<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.969> squared

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
divide 6 plus 5a over 21 a squared

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
divide 6 plus 5a over 21 a squared
because<00:02:04.200> fraction<00:02:04.590> bars<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> sense<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
because fraction bars are a sense of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.180 
because fraction bars are a sense of
division<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:07.380> okay<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> write<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
division so it's okay to write it this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.750 
division so it's okay to write it this
way<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:09.300> understand<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.319> 10<00:02:11.069> minus<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
way we understand this to be 10 minus a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.250 
way we understand this to be 10 minus a
to<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
to the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.500 
to the
power<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.950> top<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.330> fourth

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
power on top of for a to the fourth

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.740 
power on top of for a to the fourth
power<00:02:15.069> x<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.340> reciprocal<00:02:16.579> and<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.599> how

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
power x the reciprocal and this is how

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.809 
power x the reciprocal and this is how
we<00:02:17.829> divide<00:02:18.829> fractions<00:02:19.510> six<00:02:20.510> plus<00:02:20.810> five<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.819> what

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
we divide fractions six plus five a what

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.710 
we divide fractions six plus five a what
happens<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.939> these<00:02:25.939> get<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.599> be

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
happens now is that these get to be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.539 
happens now is that these get to be
simplified<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:30.260> can't<00:02:31.010> factor<00:02:31.280> up

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
simplified and so you can't factor up

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.000 
simplified and so you can't factor up
here<00:02:31.909> you<00:02:32.120> can't<00:02:32.360> factor<00:02:32.659> out<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:33.290> this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
here you can't factor out here this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
here you can't factor out here this
becomes<00:02:36.760> since<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:37.940> are<00:02:38.030> full<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.659> times<00:02:39.290> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
becomes since there are full a times a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.250 
becomes since there are full a times a
times<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.859> times<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.310> four<00:02:40.730> times<00:02:40.989> across<00:02:41.989> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
times a times a four times across this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.110 
times a times a four times across this
out<00:02:42.500> there'll<00:02:43.069> only<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.370> two<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.760> them<00:02:43.909> left

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
out there'll only be two of them left

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.910 
out there'll only be two of them left
over<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:44.959> will<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.170> completely<00:02:45.739> gone

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
over this one will be completely gone

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.660 
over this one will be completely gone
and<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.079> most<00:02:48.440> appropriate<00:02:48.709> answer<00:02:49.400> for

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
and so the most appropriate answer for

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
and so the most appropriate answer for
this<00:02:49.790> would<00:02:50.269> be<00:02:51.970> 21<00:02:53.829> times<00:02:54.829> 10<00:02:55.700> minus<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
this would be 21 times 10 minus a to the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.830 
this would be 21 times 10 minus a to the
third<00:02:56.720> power<00:02:57.459> sorry<00:02:58.599> all<00:02:59.599> on<00:03:00.290> top<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:01.840> 4a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
third power sorry all on top of 4a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.559 
third power sorry all on top of 4a
squared<00:03:03.790> times<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.030> quantity<00:03:05.379> 6<00:03:06.379> plus<00:03:06.709> 5a<00:03:07.569> now

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
squared times the quantity 6 plus 5a now

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.710 
squared times the quantity 6 plus 5a now
some<00:03:09.079> professors<00:03:09.500> actually<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.720> little

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
some professors actually get a little

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.360 
some professors actually get a little
picky<00:03:12.290> when<00:03:12.409> it<00:03:12.470> comes<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.889> problems<00:03:13.220> like

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
picky when it comes to problems like

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.990 
picky when it comes to problems like
this<00:03:13.629> so<00:03:14.629> my<00:03:14.810> advice<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.579> rewrite<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:16.790> in

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
this so my advice is rewrite this in

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.970 
this so my advice is rewrite this in
descending<00:03:17.329> order<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:17.900> factor<00:03:18.829> out<00:03:18.859> a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
descending order and factor out a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.180 
descending order and factor out a
negative<00:03:20.440> because<00:03:21.440> if<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.680> factor<00:03:21.889> out<00:03:22.069> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
negative because if you factor out a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.300 
negative because if you factor out a
negative<00:03:23.079> this<00:03:24.079> will<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:24.379> this<00:03:24.590> negative<00:03:25.099> 10

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
negative this will make this negative 10

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.189 
negative this will make this negative 10
this<00:03:25.609> will<00:03:25.760> make<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:26.030> positive<00:03:26.629> a<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
this will make this positive a to the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.220 
this will make this positive a to the
third<00:03:27.230> power<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.919> so<00:03:28.669> when<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:28.910> write<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.359> it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
third power and so when you write it it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.759 
third power and so when you write it it
just<00:03:30.530> looks<00:03:31.010> cleaner<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.669> way<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:33.530> doesn't

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
just looks cleaner this way this doesn't

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.140 
just looks cleaner this way this doesn't
have<00:03:33.919> to<00:03:34.040> have<00:03:34.250> anything<00:03:34.489> factored<00:03:35.030> out

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
have to have anything factored out

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.619 
have to have anything factored out
because<00:03:35.870> they're<00:03:36.739> both<00:03:36.919> positive<00:03:37.160> terms<00:03:37.699> so

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
because they're both positive terms so

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.539 
because they're both positive terms so
you<00:03:38.690> have<00:03:38.870> for<00:03:39.199> a<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.709> squared<00:03:40.010> power<00:03:40.220> and

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
you have for a to the squared power and

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.569 
you have for a to the squared power and
then<00:03:41.299> you'd<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.510> 5a<00:03:42.489> plus<00:03:43.489> 6<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:46.010> would<00:03:46.280> be

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
then you'd have 5a plus 6 this would be

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.169 
then you'd have 5a plus 6 this would be
the<00:03:47.329> simplified<00:03:47.930> answer
