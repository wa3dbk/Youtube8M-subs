00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510
 clans stevi 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.900
 in this first introductory video i am in short 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.510
 channel I will post their tutorials 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.330

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.580
 and of course explay is possible in 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.870
 the future I will take the voice acting 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.730
 English-language videos on clash of clans from 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 foreign letplayshchikov but that's all 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.040
 not at all in the near future so let's go 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 today i will show you a couple of replays 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.350
 I warn my yesterday's fights 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:04.860
 it was a farm and maybe you won't 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:08.020
 so interesting what are we watching so let's 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.390
 let's see this one yesterday 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:17.860
 In principle, any resources were needed and I 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:25.119
 not stingy yes so at first I will lure out to 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:30.280
 sakan gashu his archers that in principle 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.069
 understandable so let's accelerate a little bit 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.369
 because it is not really not us that way 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:39.579
 further I set the edges of the archers to 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:43.289
 they fill me with interest and here I am 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:49.390
 I begin to produce barbarians after him 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:52.810
 I understand the archers in the mines at all 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 some resources and so now i will give 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 Here I release the archers on the vault 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.530
 they put elixir chick well how 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.040
 endures I will say they are bent now 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:20.200
 barbarians inside can not stand so here I am 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:25.079
 but that's all here I ended the fight so nafarmil 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.760
 200 almost 280 thousand elixir and almost 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:38.620
 roughly 60 thousand gold look 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:41.290
 on next my fight was so here it is 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.600
 yes good fight on which I lightly 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.020
 stupid 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.640
 Now let's see it first, I think 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:56.600
 went out to gold so here I checked the end 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.080
 to it there was no sector very very 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:05.230
 bold then the bombers went blew 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.690
 the wall and here I will start now yes that's right 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.930
 releasing 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:18.560
 barbarians on the empty mines on the open 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.260
 mine they calmly endure and here I am 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.510
 endured almost all gold 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.680
 yes now almost everything and I turn yes 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.299
 as an elixir to check I release the first line 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.560
 barbarians and bows after him yes 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:44.819
 here elixir also went very well with 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.200
 decent so fast farm it 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:53.280
 then I decided to 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 beat interest up to 50 not to lose 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.159
 goblet released the remaining archers they 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.200
 smash fires but released them not quite 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:08.870
 well because they went ahead and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:13.859
 mortar them just simply interrupted everyone 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.680
 so 44 percent before and I'm here tupanul in 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:21.690
 plan that the edges were houses 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:25.139
 builders here they are Kosovo clan I 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.410
 let out was to them to fill 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.460
 these same percentages but as you can see i have them 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.220
 released in the thick of things and they 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.039
 passed away safely 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.270
 what did the battle end but the file was 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:46.750
 very very good and it is format 275 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:52.080
 thousand gold and 150,000 elixir lost 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.080
 25 dolls are not particularly critical 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.700
 Well, I think today will be 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.650
