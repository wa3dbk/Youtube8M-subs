growing<00:01:26.840> inside<00:01:27.469> them<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:28.130> won't<00:01:28.789> really<00:01:29.060> know

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
growing inside them I won't really know

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.819 
growing inside them I won't really know
until<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.719> little<00:01:30.049> hole<00:01:30.200> appears<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
until a little hole appears and the

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.460 
until a little hole appears and the
thing<00:01:31.009> turns<00:01:31.250> black<00:01:31.899> but<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.960> have<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.259> watch

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
thing turns black but I have to watch

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.919 
thing turns black but I have to watch
out<00:01:33.680> for<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:34.009> next<00:01:34.280> year<00:01:34.579> because<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.970> grubs

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
out for that next year because the grubs

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.929 
out for that next year because the grubs
hibernating<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.979> soil<00:01:37.250> under<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.670> pear<00:01:37.909> tree

so I'll have to spray the blossom next

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.720 
so I'll have to spray the blossom next
year<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.789> try<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.030> control<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.039> sad<00:01:43.039> face
