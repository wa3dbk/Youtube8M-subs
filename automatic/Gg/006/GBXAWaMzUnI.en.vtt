00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.700
 let's do the interview here with him 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.800
 good speed are making a 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 tv report what you have 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.660
 To talk about df scripts 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.600
 a group of young people who do not have to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.239
 spend the weekend and eventually 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:56.430
 nor to one side leaves any of 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:58.840
 Brasilia to get off it is not like a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.000
 barrel 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.210
 the slopes in a good car I do not have 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.610
 some people do not complain about the noise 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 so no dirt you houses to 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 sometimes even damaging the asphalt 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.410
 I can not do anything publicly. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.060
 it gives me the right to choose to do the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 wheels and until midnight after a 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.709
 car noise that got nothing 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.259

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:36.899
 make a stand of that investment 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.899
 very high millions 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.099
 in this model a and in the prototype with 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.099
 of 15 million dollars 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 we are waiting for the new technologies 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.970
 to be able to update the car's system 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.709
 you now have with the vans in 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.690
 average 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:04.270
 This is the first to make a mateus 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.580
 another fled from the other hood 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.970
 then the crazy troupe and you should 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.599
 really intend to get down there as it is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.599
 that I speak 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.030
