feels like it gives me an excuse to to
be<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> bit<00:02:54.500> angrier<00:02:54.920> than<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.250> think<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.550> am<00:02:55.580> in<00:02:55.730> my

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
be a bit angrier than I think I am in my

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.300 
be a bit angrier than I think I am in my
life<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.870> have<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> go<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.070> more

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
yeah than I would do I think probably

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.510 
yeah than I would do I think probably
most<00:03:03.830> people<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.340> think<00:03:06.100> because<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> time<00:03:07.400> to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
most people do think because the time to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.370 
most people do think because the time to
show<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:07.970> I'm<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.480> technical<00:03:08.930> people<00:03:09.080> who

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
show but I'm the technical people who

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.250 
show but I'm the technical people who
think<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.890> persona<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.690> real<00:03:12.020> and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
think that the persona is is is real and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.410 
think that the persona is is is real and
that<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.710> maybe<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.970> what<00:03:14.180> I'm<00:03:14.270> like

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
that that is maybe just what I'm like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.160 
that that is maybe just what I'm like
when<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.630> get<00:03:14.960> which<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.530> sort<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.040> true<00:03:16.340> but<00:03:16.640> but

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
when I get which is sort of true but but

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.320 
when I get which is sort of true but but
you<00:03:18.170> know<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.860> scripted<00:03:19.760> act<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.120> mean<00:03:20.240> it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
you know it's a scripted act I mean it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.440 
you know it's a scripted act I mean it
wants<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.690> feel<00:03:20.870> spontaneous<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.970> real<00:03:23.240> as

that's fine I mean they've all taken a

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.670 
that's fine I mean they've all taken a
shift<00:04:46.849> to<00:04:47.150> learn

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
shift to learn

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.990

show people come to see the show people
who<00:04:58.400> have<00:04:58.580> seen<00:04:58.819> it<00:04:58.849> will<00:04:59.120> know<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.360> it's

who have seen it will know that it's

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.839 
who have seen it will know that it's
kind<00:05:00.590> of<00:05:00.680> one<00:05:00.919> thing<00:05:01.159> after<00:05:01.430> another<00:05:01.460> after

just<00:06:23.879> cozier<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.509> I<00:06:24.569> think<00:06:24.810> um<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.289> know

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
just cozier and I think um you know

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.749 
just cozier and I think um you know
they've<00:06:25.800> got<00:06:25.979> they've<00:06:26.219> got<00:06:26.250> such<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> great

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
they've got they've got such a great

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.580 
they've got they've got such a great
kind<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.180> audience<00:06:27.509> space<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.900> know<00:06:28.050> yeah<00:06:28.379> and

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
kind of audience space you know yeah and

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.649 
kind of audience space you know yeah and
the<00:06:28.680> accident<00:06:29.099> they<00:06:29.219> kind<00:06:29.460> of<00:06:29.550> that<00:06:30.509> they

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
the accident they kind of that they

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.170 
the accident they kind of that they
promote<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:31.439> think<00:06:32.219> there<00:06:32.340> is<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.490> slight<00:06:32.669> I

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
promote I think there is a slight I

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.240 
promote I think there is a slight I
think<00:06:33.750> it's<00:06:33.870> like<00:06:34.020> so<00:06:34.169> similar<00:06:34.560> sensibility

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
think it's like so similar sensibility

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.770 
think it's like so similar sensibility
with<00:06:35.460> with<00:06:35.759> with<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.210> app<00:06:36.270> that<00:06:36.449> they<00:06:36.599> promote

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
with with with the app that they promote

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.670 
with with with the app that they promote
I<00:06:37.139> suppose<00:06:37.500> slightly<00:06:37.979> more<00:06:42.680> slightly

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
I suppose slightly more slightly

space<00:07:53.150> and<00:07:53.599> we<00:07:53.990> kind<00:07:54.199> of<00:07:54.259> involved<00:07:54.560> NASA<00:07:54.740> and

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:57.169 
it's transatlantic in the sense that I
