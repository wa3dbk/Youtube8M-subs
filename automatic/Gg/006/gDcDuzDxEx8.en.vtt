00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 title new skill to be able to have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.290
 three garages in big cars 5 online 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.109
 ok remember that when they took out the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.230
 dlc of high life update we could already 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.240
 have 3 then houses to say it of some 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 way but now with this new 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.910
 update since we can have up 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.359
 three departments that means 30 in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.550
 good face 30 vehicles and three garages 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 which is perfect and for the one who does not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 believe it, I'll prove it right now 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.399
 I'm going to buy a new house which 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 is perfect is that I had that dream 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.120
 and I said is that a real person with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.579
 a lot of money you can buy all the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 things that they want then I said another 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.360
 house would be pretty good ok then 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 we are simply going to buy one that does not 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 have to see is where it is not what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.079
 I know I like more the center 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 see is where it is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.320
 Well, I'm going to buy, never, what 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 had bought is this is going to be the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 good to see let's buy it ok and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 now as you can see we are going to the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 buy property and how they see it here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.930
 right to the top part I am 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.480
 doing 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.230
 but if as you can see , we already have 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.120
 three spaces in what you are doing then 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.800
 this part is not perfect 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.300
 look here the subscriber and it 's from your hey 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.950
 Christmas is going to come out right now 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.180
 the video is taking a picture now it's going 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 to get the photo taken but if 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.200
 as you can see it is perfect I 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.900
 I really did not believe it and I was told 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.970
 subscriber I did not believe him peruano I just 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.790
 to try it because we can have three 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 properties which is perfect in addition 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 it is very good news for people 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.160
 that he wanted more properties so 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.410
 we are going to buy it and now we 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.910
 I'm going to show the property and let's go 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 to see how decorated it is not already 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.630
 had taught that the sets were 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.520
 nothing else was the little tree and they expected more 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 little lights but it 's pretty good 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 we are not going to go here and I 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.540
 I really did not know this this 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 surprised I do not think it's not that I do not 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.110
 I was aware of that of the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 properties but well let's give it 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.490
 okay guys and here as you see it I already 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 I meet in my apartment and we go to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.250
 put this car in the garage to see 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.289
 where the cars talk about the garage 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 is that I tell them there are so many houses in 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.340
 that doing the big bout online and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 some houses that I never try to say it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.120
 in some way but good 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.950
 extreme that we will not be able to use them 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.290
 Well, what I'm going to do is just 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.570
 get me on any of these sides or 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 easier to see I think it is so that 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.850
 you know that I tell you that since it has not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.260
 used to this to see no good there 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.150
 I will see as the water later to be able 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.860
 put any car this garage but 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 good as you see it here is the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.850
 department of fair department 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.350
 here and I'm just going to show you 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.990
 not because as you just bought it you can 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.090
 have some nice interior or something 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.790
 decorated so we're just going to 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.370
 go right here and now how can they be 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.990
 appreciating we are going to appear right here 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.950
 inside as you can see I'm already 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.990
 getting into what you do 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.850
 department and how can you see also 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.860
 has its Christmas tree and its 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.570
 really decorated that is in mask and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.980
 I loved it I do not know is one of my most 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.630
 clear favorites right now I was 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.220
 playing all this but as they see it 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.620
 it's pretty good it 's decorated 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.390
 we can have 30 cars and something that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.650
 will be asking many people is that if 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.020
 this option is found for the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.000
 playstation 3 and the xbox 360 so 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.170
 now we see ourselves in that generation of 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.790
 consoles 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.590
 ok kids here we are in the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.750
 playstation 3 console and we're going to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.130
 check this of the properties you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
 find for the old generation 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.239
 I still do not know it is not checked 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.250
 leave me here I'll give you to see 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.959
 properties and we will try to buy 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.080
 any property that is found 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.060
 right here what we 're going to see see nothing 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.030
 more I have 205 thousand dollars 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.150
 it was a house that costs is to know 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.069
 to see here 200 200 ok look here there is a 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.239
 bush of 205,000 let's check 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.400

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.470
 we can have the three properties good 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.540
 it's pretty good we are forgetting to 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.580
 the old generation then klaus with 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.410
 they see it three properties something that which 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.959
 it's perfect more than anything for people 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.060
 I was tired of only having 20 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.769
 cars that look in real life with one 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.569
 you do it here I think with five is 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.739
 more than enough but good I more than 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.989
 nothing I have with a vehicle 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.580
 modified by each category for 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.709
 the races I with that I give for good 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.330
 served and may have it in different 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.130
 colors so much better so here 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.989
 we go as you see it we could have three 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.519
 I 'm not going to buy it 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.930
 simply because right now I do not want 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.639
 spend money I want to buy some 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.260
