00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 good we get out so we come from the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.190
 see the weather was unstable today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 in France with rain but also 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.120
 swimming and four departments remain 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.460
 placed on orange alert these four 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.559
 Pyrenean departments because of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.940
 risk of more severe floods but 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.680
 also now because of the risk 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.990
 of avalanches because it snowed well and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.789
 the snowpack is unstable and it's 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 this disruption the big responsible 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.029
 disturbances that came crashing 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 on the Pyrenees which brought 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 precipitation is boo chi vader 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 continue to bring rain and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.699
 snow 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.320
 so for now look on 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.790
 find our precipitation on our 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.079
 radar and snow the snow that is in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.120
 white we see that they concern 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.430
 now is the central massif and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 the pyrenees tonight it will be the case and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 of rain again that is going to get 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.020
 reactivate here on the southwest so 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 always continuous rains we note 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.469
 also instability along the coasts 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 of the sleeve this instability we're going to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.890
 find tomorrow morning in the form of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 sleet on this same area 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 we will have some snow from the northeast 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.079
 to the north of the Alps and the rain 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 from the central massif to the Pyrenees this 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.629
 zoned 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 it will be reduced in the afternoon but it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 will always rain on the departments 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.049
 concerned with orange vigilance 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
 on the other hand here instability will win 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 land between brittany and north 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.049
 no calais to the ardennes so the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.280
 sleet of the wind that will blow enough 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.650
 loud and why not a thunderclap 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.330
 on the northeast some flakes of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.470
 snow on the Alsace precisely then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.240
 tomorrow morning temperatures quite 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 low -1 degrees to lille 7 degrees to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.570
 biarritz and the afternoon the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.759
 temperatures according to the means of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 season or slightly below 2 Â° to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.409
 aurillac 13 degrees to nice go we're going 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 watch trends with sunday 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.320
 always this instability along the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.710
 ribs of the sleeve but she will win 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 to the northeast to the limousin 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 on the other hand here they are no longer 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 more regular but also 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.829
 the instability of ice pellets on the southwest 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
 from France and then elsewhere you rent 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.149
 the weather remains gloomy with showers 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.250
 Monday finally a lull but already a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.860
 new disturbance that will happen by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 west and Tuesday we will have again 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.979
 rains over the south west of France 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 rains continue so more to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.259
 monitor 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.649
 I'll find you in a moment for the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.869
 snow weather thank you so forecast 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.250
 is first state of the good evening tania 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.990
 young 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 four departments it was said in title 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.170
 are therefore kept alert orange 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 rain and flood and we just got it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.270
 see now on these same 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.840
 departments adds the risk 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.580
 avalanche 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 yes then here they are these four 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.120
 concerned departments and it is not 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.410
 a chance if it is on the chain 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.849
 pyrenees because it is partly 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.800
 responsible for the situation will see on 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.970
 the radar how are you going to see the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.370
 rain coming in a north stream 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.489
 north west and that comes hang on 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110
 the Pyrenean relief is called the effect 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.660
 orographic so a lot of rain from 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.879
 snow that just settles on on the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.950
 relief and on the piedmont also so 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.910
 since yesterday we have good amounts of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.040
 rain still on guard and get 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.769
 feel it's seventy starters at 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 80 mm of rain on the Basque heights 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.900
 that's a lot of it's the equivalent of a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.370
 month of precipitation 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.349
 so we have a good watch 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 of water including rose and adour and 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.470
 then there is the snow also the snow which 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.000
 has fallen in good quantity in few 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.610
 weather so an unstable snowpack 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.090
 an avalanche risk that is 4 out of 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.220
 5 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.989
 regarding the sequel now 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.579
 following events he is still going 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.319
 it's raining to watch some cumulations 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.870
 expected by Sunday 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.000
 so here we are on 48 hours so 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 over the duration even if the accumulations are 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.079
 important in addition the limit rain snow 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.760
 will go down 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.079
 so it will not rain anymore on the reliefs 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 since it will snow streams 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.049
 will be less fueled and their 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.730
 reactions will be easier to 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.590
 control their reactions will be more 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.750
 slow but we always watch these 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.100
 stream and in particular the nive near this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.600
 we could say tonight on the front 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.760
 bad weather thank you lair for these 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.870
 clarification finds you obviously 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.870
 just after this diary
