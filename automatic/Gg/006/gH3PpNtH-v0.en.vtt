two decks I'm talking about infernity

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740 
two decks I'm talking about infernity
and<00:00:12.039> X<00:00:12.519> sabers<00:00:13.030> this<00:00:13.180> is<00:00:13.269> going<00:00:13.389> to<00:00:13.450> be<00:00:13.539> kind<00:00:13.719> of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
and X sabers this is going to be kind of

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.659 
and X sabers this is going to be kind of
like<00:00:13.869> a<00:00:13.990> blast<00:00:14.290> in<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.530> past<00:00:14.740> video<00:00:15.099> when<00:00:15.639> I

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:15.669 
like a blast in the past video when I

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.280 
like a blast in the past video when I
think<00:00:15.759> of<00:00:15.969> these<00:00:16.119> two<00:00:16.330> decks<00:00:16.570> I<00:00:16.720> get<00:00:17.080> very

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
think of these two decks I get very

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.320 
think of these two decks I get very
nostalgic<00:00:17.740> despite<00:00:18.279> the<00:00:18.400> fact<00:00:18.610> that<00:00:18.759> there

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
nostalgic despite the fact that there

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.909 
nostalgic despite the fact that there
wasn't<00:00:19.509> too<00:00:19.840> long<00:00:20.020> ago<00:00:20.080> that<00:00:20.380> these<00:00:20.680> decks

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
wasn't too long ago that these decks

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.040 
wasn't too long ago that these decks
were<00:00:21.070> in<00:00:21.189> their<00:00:21.369> heyday<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:22.029> they<00:00:22.779> haven't

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
were in their heyday and they haven't

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.049 
were in their heyday and they haven't
really<00:00:23.169> done<00:00:23.439> anything<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:24.220> notes<00:00:24.700> and

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:25.059 
really done anything of notes and

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:26.639 
really done anything of notes and
probably<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.869> latter<00:00:26.050> part<00:00:26.169> of<00:00:26.410> two<00:00:26.619> years

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
probably the latter part of two years

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.830 
probably the latter part of two years
but<00:00:27.160> I<00:00:27.340> really<00:00:27.939> do<00:00:28.119> wish<00:00:28.329> that<00:00:28.360> there<00:00:28.660> was<00:00:28.779> more

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
but I really do wish that there was more

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.659 
but I really do wish that there was more
of<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.259> place<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.710> them<00:00:29.829> in<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.160> competitive

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
of a place of them in the competitive

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.609 
of a place of them in the competitive

you know despite the fact that both of
these<00:01:40.990> decks<00:01:41.289> get<00:01:41.499> absolutely<00:01:42.009> hammered<00:01:42.130> by

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
these decks get absolutely hammered by

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.340 
these decks get absolutely hammered by
macro<00:01:43.240> rabid<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:43.689> that's<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.929> whole<00:01:44.079> different

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
macro rabid and that's a whole different

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.679 
macro rabid and that's a whole different
topic<00:01:44.649> but<00:01:45.399> we'll<00:01:45.670> talk<00:01:45.850> about<00:01:46.029> the<00:01:46.270> matchups

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
topic but we'll talk about the matchups

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.510 
topic but we'll talk about the matchups
for<00:01:46.840> infernity<00:01:47.289> right<00:01:47.560> now<00:01:47.709> when<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.189> look<00:01:48.369> at

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
for infernity right now when I look at

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.429 
for infernity right now when I look at
the<00:01:48.609> top<00:01:48.819> four<00:01:49.119> decks<00:01:49.389> let's<00:01:49.569> say<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:49.959> no<00:01:50.139> order

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the top four decks let's say in no order

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.649 
the top four decks let's say in no order
agents<00:01:51.130> wind-ups<00:01:51.609> and<00:01:51.729> myrrh<00:01:52.179> meal<00:01:52.389> I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
agents wind-ups and myrrh meal I

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.019 
agents wind-ups and myrrh meal I
actually<00:01:53.139> think<00:01:53.499> that<00:01:53.679> I<00:01:54.219> actually<00:01:54.729> think

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
actually think that I actually think

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.669 
actually think that I actually think
that<00:01:55.119> infernity<00:01:55.630> has<00:01:55.840> pretty<00:01:56.109> decent

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
that infernity has pretty decent

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.830 
that infernity has pretty decent
matchups<00:01:57.189> against<00:01:57.819> those<00:01:57.999> decks<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.420> my<00:01:58.539> sole

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
matchups against those decks and my sole

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.019 
matchups against those decks and my sole
reason<00:01:59.109> for<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.679> is<00:01:59.889> none<00:02:00.429> of<00:02:00.579> those<00:02:00.700> decks

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:01.029 
reason for this is none of those decks

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.419 
reason for this is none of those decks
play<00:02:01.270> defense<00:02:01.779> particularly<00:02:02.259> well<00:02:02.859> why<00:02:03.399> not

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
play defense particularly well why not

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.309 
play defense particularly well why not
sway<00:02:03.849> pretty<00:02:04.149> decent<00:02:04.659> defense<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.169> these

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
sway pretty decent defense but these

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.649 
sway pretty decent defense but these
aren't<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:05.829> not<00:02:06.069> like<00:02:06.219> hero<00:02:06.549> or<00:02:06.849> rabbit<00:02:07.569> the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
aren't this not like hero or rabbit the

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.050 
aren't this not like hero or rabbit the
thing<00:02:07.840> about<00:02:08.080> infernity<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.099> infernity<00:02:09.670> would

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
thing about infernity is infernity would

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.580 
thing about infernity is infernity would
commonly<00:02:10.479> lose<00:02:10.720> two<00:02:10.929> decks<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.319> could<00:02:11.470> play

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
commonly lose two decks that could play

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.650 
commonly lose two decks that could play

never<00:04:52.060> really<00:04:52.419> used<00:04:52.629> saber<00:04:52.900> whole<00:04:53.139> like<00:04:53.319> I

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
never really used saber whole like I

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.959 
never really used saber whole like I
understand<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.099> it<00:04:54.219> didn't<00:04:54.460> work<00:04:54.610> when<00:04:54.879> you

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
understand that it didn't work when you

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.399 
understand that it didn't work when you
didn't<00:04:55.180> have<00:04:55.240> an<00:04:55.389> X<00:04:55.539> a<00:04:55.689> bow<00:04:55.749> on<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:55.960> field<00:04:56.229> but

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
didn't have an X a bow on the field but

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.929 
didn't have an X a bow on the field but
same<00:04:56.590> rules<00:04:56.830> always<00:04:57.039> been<00:04:57.279> a<00:04:57.310> ridiculously

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
same rules always been a ridiculously

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.360 
same rules always been a ridiculously
great<00:04:58.300> card<00:04:58.569> now<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.169> problem<00:04:59.620> with<00:04:59.830> Xavier's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
great card now the problem with Xavier's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.519 
great card now the problem with Xavier's
right<00:05:00.699> now<00:05:00.939> I<00:05:01.270> don't<00:05:01.750> even<00:05:01.870> think<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.289> it's

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:02.529 
right now I don't even think that it's

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.469 
right now I don't even think that it's
the<00:05:02.680> deck<00:05:02.889> itself<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.460> Dark<00:05:03.699> Soul<00:05:04.029> ruling

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
the deck itself the Dark Soul ruling

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.909 
the deck itself the Dark Soul ruling
where<00:05:04.659> they<00:05:04.750> don't<00:05:04.930> stack<00:05:05.259> multiple<00:05:05.529> times

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
where they don't stack multiple times

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.040 
where they don't stack multiple times
obviously<00:05:06.639> hurt<00:05:06.819> the<00:05:06.969> debt<00:05:07.180> but<00:05:07.599> i<00:05:07.629> think<00:05:07.870> it's

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
obviously hurt the debt but i think it's

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.249 
obviously hurt the debt but i think it's
the<00:05:08.139> problem<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:09.580> know<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:10.120> ixia<00:05:10.629> era<00:05:10.900> in

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
the problem of you know the ixia era in

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.260 
the problem of you know the ixia era in
exceeds<00:05:11.949> being<00:05:12.250> much<00:05:12.520> more<00:05:12.729> powerful<00:05:13.029> than

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
exceeds being much more powerful than

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.999 
exceeds being much more powerful than
synchros<00:05:13.719> right<00:05:13.900> now<00:05:14.080> because<00:05:14.409> you<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.949> you

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
synchros right now because you know you

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:15.959 
synchros right now because you know you
look<00:05:15.159> at<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.340> lot<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.699> most<00:05:15.849> powerful

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
look at a lot of the most powerful

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.689 
look at a lot of the most powerful
synchros<00:05:16.629> like<00:05:16.779> trishula<00:05:17.439> and<00:05:17.650> brio<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.550> go

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
synchros like trishula and brio and go

synchros like trishula and brio and go
yo<00:05:18.909> i<00:05:18.939> mean<00:05:19.210> they're<00:05:19.360> all<00:05:19.509> banned<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.259> Xavier's

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
yo i mean they're all banned in Xavier's

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
could make those cards very easily you

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.649 
could make those cards very easily you
know<00:05:23.259> III<00:05:24.219> think<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.879> the<00:05:25.000> power<00:05:25.180> creep<00:05:25.509> has

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
know III think that the power creep has

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.839 
know III think that the power creep has
just<00:05:25.870> been<00:05:26.050> very<00:05:26.080> very<00:05:26.529> bad<00:05:27.129> to<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.580> deck<00:05:27.819> like

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
just been very very bad to a deck like

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.149 
just been very very bad to a deck like
xox<00:05:28.599> savers<00:05:28.990> where<00:05:29.439> you<00:05:29.589> look<00:05:29.740> at<00:05:29.889> a<00:05:29.919> deck<00:05:30.129> like

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
xox savers where you look at a deck like

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.459 
xox savers where you look at a deck like
GBS<00:05:30.759> and<00:05:30.999> when<00:05:31.360> jeebies<00:05:31.689> get<00:05:31.930> rolling<00:05:32.379> they

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
GBS and when jeebies get rolling they

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.439 
GBS and when jeebies get rolling they
can<00:05:32.650> pick<00:05:32.800> apart<00:05:32.949> pretty<00:05:33.580> much<00:05:33.849> any<00:05:34.089> deck<00:05:34.330> of

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
can pick apart pretty much any deck of

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.300 
can pick apart pretty much any deck of
the<00:05:34.509> meta<00:05:34.750> x<00:05:35.289> labors<00:05:35.680> don't<00:05:35.889> really<00:05:36.069> have<00:05:36.279> that

the meta x labors don't really have that
power<00:05:36.699> anymore<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.569> know<00:05:37.689> its<00:05:37.930> power<00:05:38.139> plays

helps<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.460> deck<00:06:24.639> I<00:06:24.819> really<00:06:25.270> can't<00:06:25.300> think<00:06:25.689> of

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:25.899 
helps the deck I really can't think of

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:28.829 
helps the deck I really can't think of
me<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.289> that's<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:26.889> reason<00:06:27.099> why<00:06:27.569> despite<00:06:28.569> the

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:28.839 
me and that's the reason why despite the

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.990 
me and that's the reason why despite the
fact<00:06:28.990> that<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.199> don't<00:06:29.379> see<00:06:29.649> X<00:06:30.099> sabers<00:06:30.639> as<00:06:30.789> a

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
fact that I don't see X sabers as a

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.240 
fact that I don't see X sabers as a
particularly<00:06:31.719> weak<00:06:32.529> that<00:06:32.740> gets<00:06:32.919> not<00:06:33.099> gonna

come back or anything I just think it's

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.990 
come back or anything I just think it's
kind<00:06:35.319> of<00:06:35.379> a<00:06:35.500> shame<00:06:35.529> that<00:06:35.769> exceeds<00:06:36.519> didn't<00:06:36.819> help

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
at I look at the top four matchups and I

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.029 
at I look at the top four matchups and I
don't<00:06:53.660> really<00:06:53.810> see<00:06:54.110> any<00:06:54.380> of<00:06:54.650> them<00:06:54.800> being

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
don't really see any of them being

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.150 
don't really see any of them being
advantageous<00:06:55.669> I<00:06:56.090> look<00:06:56.840> at<00:06:57.080> Marvel<00:06:57.560> Atlanteans

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
advantageous I look at Marvel Atlanteans

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.610 
advantageous I look at Marvel Atlanteans
and<00:06:58.430> that's<00:06:58.820> one<00:06:59.000> of<00:06:59.120> those<00:06:59.210> decks<00:06:59.570> where<00:06:59.810> you

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
and that's one of those decks where you

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.469 
and that's one of those decks where you
don't<00:07:00.740> have<00:07:00.889> the<00:07:01.190> power<00:07:01.430> in<00:07:01.669> dec<00:07:01.940> sabers<00:07:02.330> or

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
don't have the power in dec sabers or

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.330 
don't have the power in dec sabers or
the<00:07:02.630> speed<00:07:02.930> to<00:07:03.169> knock<00:07:03.410> that<00:07:03.620> deck<00:07:03.889> out<00:07:04.070> when

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
the speed to knock that deck out when

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.070 
the speed to knock that deck out when
it's<00:07:04.490> you<00:07:04.759> know<00:07:04.880> maybe<00:07:05.300> it<00:07:05.479> just<00:07:05.509> starts<00:07:05.960> off

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
it's you know maybe it just starts off

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.200 
it's you know maybe it just starts off
with<00:07:06.229> undying<00:07:06.770> and<00:07:07.009> just<00:07:07.160> passes<00:07:07.610> like<00:07:08.000> you

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
with undying and just passes like you

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.760 
with undying and just passes like you
don't<00:07:08.389> have<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.720> power<00:07:08.930> to<00:07:09.080> knock<00:07:09.320> that<00:07:09.350> deck

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.159 
don't have the power to knock that deck
out<00:07:09.949> I<00:07:10.250> don't<00:07:10.669> think<00:07:10.789> your<00:07:11.060> is<00:07:11.180> explosive<00:07:11.810> his

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:12.169 
out I don't think your is explosive his

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.629 
out I don't think your is explosive his
wind-ups<00:07:12.590> i<00:07:12.680> think<00:07:12.860> in<00:07:12.949> wind-ups<00:07:13.280> is<00:07:13.400> just

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
wind-ups i think in wind-ups is just

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.610 
wind-ups i think in wind-ups is just
basically<00:07:14.030> a<00:07:14.150> newer<00:07:14.419> better<00:07:14.900> version<00:07:15.350> of<00:07:15.410> X

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
basically a newer better version of X

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.800 
basically a newer better version of X
sabers<00:07:16.039> and<00:07:16.070> maybe<00:07:16.760> you<00:07:16.940> can<00:07:17.090> catch<00:07:17.240> agents

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
sabers and maybe you can catch agents

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.510 
sabers and maybe you can catch agents
sleeping<00:07:18.110> a<00:07:18.169> couple<00:07:18.470> of<00:07:18.560> times<00:07:18.770> but<00:07:18.979> you<00:07:19.400> know

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 
sleeping a couple of times but you know

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.219 
sleeping a couple of times but you know
if<00:07:19.610> they<00:07:19.760> get<00:07:19.970> something<00:07:20.240> like<00:07:20.479> Hyperion<00:07:21.110> on

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229 
if they get something like Hyperion on

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.620 
if they get something like Hyperion on
the<00:07:21.350> field<00:07:21.620> it's<00:07:22.340> pretty<00:07:22.729> difficult<00:07:23.030> to<00:07:23.449> get

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
the field it's pretty difficult to get

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.939 
the field it's pretty difficult to get
it<00:07:23.750> off<00:07:23.840> the<00:07:23.990> board<00:07:24.260> you<00:07:24.470> know<00:07:24.590> I<00:07:24.620> mean<00:07:24.770> X

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
it off the board you know I mean X

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.129 
it off the board you know I mean X
Sabres<00:07:25.310> don't<00:07:25.580> really<00:07:25.820> have<00:07:25.970> big<00:07:26.630> beaters

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
Sabres don't really have big beaters

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.920 
Sabres don't really have big beaters
when<00:07:27.560> you<00:07:27.680> look<00:07:27.979> at<00:07:28.130> anything<00:07:28.340> above<00:07:28.789> 2500<00:07:29.750> so

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930 
when you look at anything above 2500 so

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.290 
when you look at anything above 2500 so
you<00:07:30.410> know<00:07:30.530> obvious<00:07:31.039> as<00:07:31.190> opposite<00:07:31.729> sounds<00:07:32.210> I

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
you know obvious as opposite sounds I

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.029 
you know obvious as opposite sounds I
think<00:07:32.360> that<00:07:32.690> infernity<00:07:33.289> is<00:07:33.440> the<00:07:33.590> better<00:07:33.800> deck

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 
think that infernity is the better deck

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.129 
think that infernity is the better deck
right<00:07:34.250> now<00:07:34.280> because<00:07:34.760> at<00:07:35.150> the<00:07:35.599> very<00:07:35.630> least

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:36.139 
right now because at the very least

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.290 
right now because at the very least
infernity<00:07:37.010> can<00:07:37.310> catch<00:07:37.490> these<00:07:37.789> decks<00:07:38.090> that

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
infernity can catch these decks that

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.170 
infernity can catch these decks that
play<00:07:38.630> really<00:07:38.900> bad<00:07:39.229> defense<00:07:39.800> and<00:07:40.009> say<00:07:40.639> oops<00:07:40.880> we

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.180 
play really bad defense and say oops we

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.820 
play really bad defense and say oops we

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.529 
top deck that our treat I win you know
what<00:07:42.949> I<00:07:42.979> mean<00:07:43.070> or<00:07:43.400> you<00:07:43.760> can<00:07:43.940> catch<00:07:44.150> people

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:44.539 
what I mean or you can catch people

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:45.879 
what I mean or you can catch people
sleeping<00:07:44.990> right<00:07:45.110> now<00:07:45.289> with<00:07:45.470> infernity

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889 
sleeping right now with infernity

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820 
think that in front of these probably

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.939
