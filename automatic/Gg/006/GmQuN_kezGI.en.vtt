00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
move out that may be because of the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.380 
move out that may be because of the
nylons<00:03:39.709> if<00:03:40.100> anyone<00:03:40.519> else<00:03:40.640> has<00:03:40.820> this<00:03:40.970> character

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
nylons if anyone else has this character

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.199 
nylons if anyone else has this character
let<00:03:41.600> me<00:03:41.720> know<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:42.080> yours<00:03:42.350> goes<00:03:43.100> side<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> side

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
let me know if yours goes side to side

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.259 
let me know if yours goes side to side
like<00:03:44.510> in<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.959> out<00:03:45.050> mine<00:03:45.920> goes<00:03:46.190> back<00:03:47.060> and

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
like in and out mine goes back and

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.420 
like in and out mine goes back and
forward<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.350> does<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:48.709> pull<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.010> I'm

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
forward but it does not pull out I'm

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.699 
forward but it does not pull out I'm
thinking<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.420> might<00:03:50.570> be<00:03:50.630> because<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.290> nylons

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
thinking it might be because the nylons

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.400 
thinking it might be because the nylons
they<00:03:52.010> went<00:03:52.340> up<00:03:52.459> inside<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.090> tied<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:53.630> they

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
they went up inside and tied it so they

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.310 
they went up inside and tied it so they
didn't<00:03:54.650> want<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.010> pull<00:03:55.220> out<00:03:55.989> but<00:03:56.989> if

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
didn't want it to pull out but if

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.050 
didn't want it to pull out but if
anybody<00:03:57.650> has<00:03:57.830> one<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.250> does<00:03:58.550> different<00:03:58.880> than

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
anybody has one it does different than

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.229 
anybody has one it does different than
that<00:03:59.180> let<00:03:59.390> me<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.920> then<00:04:01.100> she<00:04:02.000> has<00:04:02.209> a

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
that let me know but then she has a

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.170

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.900 
split in the leg right above her knee
which<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.080> kind<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.440> hard<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> move<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.280> turn

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
which is kind of hard to move and turn

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.430 
which is kind of hard to move and turn
the<00:04:08.030> leg<00:04:08.239> because<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.989> nylon<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.840> uh<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.410> a

even has a little side to side pivot
which<00:04:23.900> was<00:04:24.050> nice<00:04:24.229> really<00:04:25.190> like<00:04:25.460> that
