00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
more control over the drift which is you

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.040 
more control over the drift which is you
know<00:00:44.320> something<00:00:45.690> basically<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> heart<00:00:46.960> of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
know something basically the heart of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.620 
know something basically the heart of
ridge<00:00:47.230> racer<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.680> drifting<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:49.420> do

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
ridge racer is drifting and what you do

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.530 
ridge racer is drifting and what you do
is<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:51.070> basically<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.700> swivel<00:00:51.970> it<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.329> hold

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
is you basically you swivel it you hold

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.630 
is you basically you swivel it you hold
it<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.720> one<00:00:52.780> hand<00:00:52.950> see<00:00:53.950> if<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.070> can<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.310> this<00:00:54.430> in

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
it in one hand see if I can do this in

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.540 
it in one hand see if I can do this in
any<00:00:55.120> reasonable<00:00:55.510> means<00:00:55.750> no<00:00:56.230> as<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.340> can<00:00:57.430> see

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
any reasonable means no as you can see

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.040 
any reasonable means no as you can see
it<00:00:57.730> rotates<00:00:58.150> like<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:59.430> see<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.690> basically

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
it rotates like that see and basically

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.210 
it rotates like that see and basically
as<00:01:02.770> you<00:01:03.340> swivel<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.119> acts<00:01:04.299> as<00:01:04.509> an<00:01:04.629> analog

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
as you swivel it that acts as an analog

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.010 
as you swivel it that acts as an analog
which<00:01:06.220> controls<00:01:06.640> your<00:01:06.759> steering<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:07.360> really

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
which controls your steering it's really

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.010 
which controls your steering it's really
really<00:01:08.500> peculiar<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:10.509> can't<00:01:10.720> use<00:01:10.899> the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
really peculiar and you can't use the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.050 
really peculiar and you can't use the
d-pad<00:01:11.200> will<00:01:11.560> read<00:01:11.740> if<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.549> want<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.759> avoid<00:01:12.909> the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
d-pad will read if you want to avoid the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.880 
d-pad will read if you want to avoid the
point<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.390> pad<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.409> feels<00:01:14.710> really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
point of this pad and it feels really

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.319 
point of this pad and it feels really
weird<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.340> kind<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.549> a<00:01:15.640> cool<00:01:15.790> feature<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
weird it's kind of a cool feature the

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.419 
weird it's kind of a cool feature the
idea<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.780> give<00:01:16.899> you<00:01:16.990> more<00:01:17.140> control<00:01:17.429> with

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
idea is to give you more control with

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.330 
idea is to give you more control with
analog<00:01:18.759> steering<00:01:19.119> stead<00:01:19.329> of<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.479> d-pad<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
analog steering stead of a d-pad and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.499 
analog steering stead of a d-pad and
because<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.520> think<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:21.789> came<00:01:21.969> out<00:01:21.999> before<00:01:22.479> we

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
because I think this came out before we

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.749 
because I think this came out before we
sort<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.869> had<00:01:23.020> their<00:01:23.429> analogs<00:01:24.429> on<00:01:24.609> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
sort of had their analogs on the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.129 
sort of had their analogs on the
PlayStation<00:01:25.299> controllers<00:01:25.630> are<00:01:25.749> standard

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:26.139 
PlayStation controllers are standard

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:29.219 
PlayStation controllers are standard
it's<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.979> really<00:01:27.219> strange<00:01:28.229> really

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
it's just a really strange really

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.230 
it's just a really strange really
strange<00:01:29.350> controller<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.789> it's<00:01:30.909> got<00:01:31.030> such<00:01:31.209> a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
strange controller but it's got such a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.789 
strange controller but it's got such a
unique<00:01:31.569> look<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:32.229> what<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> wanted<00:01:32.679> for

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799

well<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:25.640> radio<00:02:26.030> dial<00:02:26.800> acts<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.100> same<00:02:28.370> as

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
well this radio dial acts the same as

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
well this radio dial acts the same as
the<00:02:28.880> axis<00:02:29.300> inside<00:02:29.780> there<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.740> basically<00:02:31.100> this

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the axis inside there so basically this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.850 
the axis inside there so basically this
controls<00:02:32.150> your<00:02:32.270> steering<00:02:32.570> as<00:02:33.410> weird<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
controls your steering as weird as that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.890 
controls your steering as weird as that
is<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.090> effectively<00:02:35.450> play<00:02:35.720> ridge

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
is so you can effectively play ridge

with<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:39.410> quite<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> few<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
with this I think it's quite a few and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
with this I think it's quite a few and
and<00:02:40.820> yet<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.330> drift<00:02:41.510> using<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.930> now<00:02:42.200> as

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
and yet you can drift using this now as

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.130 
and yet you can drift using this now as
you<00:02:42.500> hear<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.770> there<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:47.150> got<00:02:47.480> quite<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.930> lot

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
you hear it there it's got quite a lot

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.350 
you hear it there it's got quite a lot
of<00:02:48.230> feedback<00:02:48.520> when<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.610> pull<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.880> down<00:02:50.060> cual

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
of feedback when you pull it down cual

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.500 
of feedback when you pull it down cual
our<00:02:50.480> resistance<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.170> kind<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.380> cool<00:02:51.590> again

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
our resistance it's kind of cool again

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.670 
our resistance it's kind of cool again
nothing<00:02:53.510> more<00:02:53.780> than<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.930> novelty<00:02:54.230> item<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.650> I
