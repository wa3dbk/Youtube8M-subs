00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in that process um no I think it was all

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.249 
in that process um no I think it was all
very<00:01:13.159> straightforward<00:01:14.479> all<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> gm's<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
very straightforward all the gm's and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
very straightforward all the gm's and
all<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> scouts<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.610> wanted<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
all the scouts I just wanted to get a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.429 
all the scouts I just wanted to get a
better<00:01:18.540> understanding<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
better understanding of the kind of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.320 
better understanding of the kind of
person<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.060> another<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
person you are and another kind of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
difference so obviously it's it's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520
