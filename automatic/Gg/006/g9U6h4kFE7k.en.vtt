00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 if you get all of me I'm cords of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.480
 states and this is minecraft here 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.340
 we found another beautiful day in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.240
 minecraft we comment on Wednesday 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.820
 you will leave on Wednesdays 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.549
 motta saco and the world and the truth that is 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 an interesting thing and possibly it is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.779
 something that I could add in minecraft for 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
 the merit to see let's see if in this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 man of all the pressures that if in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.539
 vehicle that is new 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.619
 give a little more efficiency to the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 objects in a little more efficiency 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 certain things that is that are necessary 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 so when we go with the motorcycle 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.550
 very clear that what you are going to add is a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 arch scales different arcs according 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.360
 that are here the planteos but that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.280
 what you can do is that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 furthermore lances arrows as the current 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.199
 to the karkh or that we have here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 your spears arrows and then also 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.280
 it's also going to be like swords like 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 to mutate it is like putting it together 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 Character that makes sword and bow at the same time 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.230
 in that example a normal arc with two 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.969
 blocks of wood will give me this bow 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 it's worth as you see him he puts wood not and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.880
 puts bow sword that is a frame that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 the time to throw arrows and make the theme 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.039
 of the bow is worth the spears arrows 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.440
 It is also used as a sword that will help us 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.649
 save on sword characters or not 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.240
 it saves us but it will take away 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.880
 Space spaces less than we can 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.880
 make a use with the theme of having 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 to have here sword and the bow to the side 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 it is simply in approaching said is for 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.830
 that we do not launch dates that are 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.720
 close we beat to lose that being 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 changing is worth the change is a loss 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.860
 what can be done then wood is 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.050
 You can make kobe this is what you use 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.610
 you can not use this it is not leaving you 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.290
 it does not let you do the character if you want 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.710
 use stone and this process will remain 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 stone arch 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.420
 if we put iron ingots we 're going to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.550
 give this lovely boat with bullion 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.940
 gold gives us this other bow and with a 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.130
 diamond gives us this other boat worth 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.180
 let's try it 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 OK 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.039
 sitting to the fullest is very very very happy 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.690
 obviously the year that acs is seven 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.940
 years when he is here as a bow is worth 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.420
 say that the arch itself wins the damage 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.840
 that has the sword is worth now we see 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.340
 here a moment and that is a sword of 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.550
 wood has a counterattack a bow of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.440
 wood has 4 556 6 7 7 4 4 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.459
 while normal frame has no harm 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 so that's why they killed him 6 he killed them 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.280
 hit with the diamond but if I 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.280
 I take the wooden 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.359
 one 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.650
 damn more I was not helping two 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.560
 bars that is not the same year 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 but hey, look, it's very good, it's 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 important that we can happen these 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.890
 bows can be singing styles we can 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 try even more the answer is yes 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.040
 because it can just pass us 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.140
 but we can check this even more 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.010
 and enchantments are going to come out here is going to 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.290
 leave the enchantments of swords that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.659
 it's going to come out here clear because it's an arc 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.209
 sword well then let's see all the 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.870
 that are coming to us already if you see a 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.430
 little bit what is it that gives us a break 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.290
 pin to death and end is worth you call me neither 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.540
 nothing like that maybe if we thought 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.980
 that we'll talk about it for a moment 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.980
 It will remove the doubts 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.670
 to see if it takes away even the most 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.560
 we do in a moment is worth at level 30 to 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.700
 see what kind of enchantments we can 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.069
 give our bow sword worth 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.360
 a breaking 3 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.130
 man what interest 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.070
 man what interest 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.980
 more the same shit and it looks like it's a 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.650
 breaking 3 for life is worth so as 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.450
 You see, what is there is not going to give you 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 such ismos to power in plan to leave 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.260
 Perez or anything by style is worth the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.660
 perhaps the only downside that we could give 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.920
 to this beautiful mod and already this operation 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.270
 out is a mode does not have to be 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.130
 perfect if you liked drive 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.980

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.210
