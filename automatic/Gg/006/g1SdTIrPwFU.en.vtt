around with these bars cleans it up a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
around with these bars cleans it up a
little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:53.670> sort<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> nice<00:00:54.120> edge

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
little bit that's sort of nice edge

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.590 
little bit that's sort of nice edge
brightness<00:00:56.059> gives<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> sort<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> more

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

clarity to the photo and then edge width
I<00:01:01.680> might<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> knock<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> down<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I might want to knock that down a little

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.509 
I might want to knock that down a little
bit<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.930> give<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.979> technical

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
let's leave it a bit wider and I can hit

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.460 
let's leave it a bit wider and I can hit
OK<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.509> now<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> invert

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
OK and now I'm going to want to invert

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.190 
OK and now I'm going to want to invert
this<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> image

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
this so I'm going to go to image

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.039 
this so I'm going to go to image
adjustments<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.119> invert<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.420> command<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
adjustments and invert or command I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
adjustments and invert or command I
whatever<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.580> comfortable<00:01:23.759> with

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and that flips it to look like that and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
and that flips it to look like that and
you<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.390> nice<00:01:27.920> dirty<00:01:28.920> looking

that out you can use brightness and
contrast<00:01:39.750> maybe<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.040> kill<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

lingering<00:01:52.680> photographic<00:01:53.610> colors<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.360> going

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
lingering photographic colors I'm going

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
lingering photographic colors I'm going
to<00:01:54.659> open<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.250> hue/saturation<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.430> did<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to open up my hue/saturation I did that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899 
to open up my hue/saturation I did that
with<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> hot<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.560> sorry<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> shortcut<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
with a hot or sorry a shortcut but you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.950 
with a hot or sorry a shortcut but you
can<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> adjustments<00:02:01.079> hue/saturation

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
can go to adjustments hue/saturation

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
can go to adjustments hue/saturation
take<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> saturation<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.920> down

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
take the saturation right down

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.190 
take the saturation right down
now<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.510> looks<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.870> was<00:02:06.960> drawn<00:02:07.110> with

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
now it looks like it was drawn with

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.719 
now it looks like it was drawn with
pencil<00:02:07.260> now<00:02:07.800> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> make<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.580> look

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
pencil now if you want to make this look

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.160 
pencil now if you want to make this look
like<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:09.000> wasn't<00:02:09.330> drawn<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.600> pencil<00:02:09.750> maybe

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
like it wasn't drawn in pencil maybe

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.390 
like it wasn't drawn in pencil maybe
with<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:11.000> drafting<00:02:12.000> program<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:13.620> AutoCAD<00:02:14.370> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
with a drafting program like AutoCAD and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
with a drafting program like AutoCAD and
then<00:02:14.700> print<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.960> actually<00:02:16.230> go<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
then print it up you can actually go to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.570 
then print it up you can actually go to
your<00:02:17.570> effects<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.050> put<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:20.150> color<00:02:21.150> overlay<00:02:21.240> of

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
your effects and put a color overlay of

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.800 
your effects and put a color overlay of
something<00:02:23.580> dark<00:02:23.910> blue<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:26.550> screen<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
something dark blue and a screen on the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.620 
something dark blue and a screen on the
blend<00:02:28.110> mode<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.030> there<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.240> look<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.480> that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
blend mode and there you go look at that

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.990 
blend mode and there you go look at that
looks<00:02:31.110> very<00:02:31.350> architectural<00:02:31.950> hopefully<00:02:32.850> that

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
looks very architectural hopefully that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
looks very architectural hopefully that
