downloaded you need to go to AI file now

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
downloaded you need to go to AI file now
in<00:00:44.100> ifile<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.260> bar<00:00:46.969> then<00:00:47.969> mobile<00:00:48.590> now

in ifile you go to bar then mobile now
all<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.860> likely<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> already<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
all most likely this is already going to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
case mobile applications and then you're

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270
