00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.620
 what happened is good that the end of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.980
 world already transforms it is called the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.980
 land 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.630
 after as much as it works that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.630
 they came to a houses as they can 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.030
 if I know you did not expect to find you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.710
 with last problems doing 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.850
 shows on the street for money but 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.970
 you have to have that this situation is 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.970
 hard 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.960
 [Music] 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 even on the corner of vito street 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.469
 your power rangers again asked for money 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.789
 and the accustomed people go through the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.260
 audio or case makes you like who says 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.149
 look at the last plan there is again 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.210
 asking for money 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:00.399
 and that makes me do is put gasoline where 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.140
 would take the mechanic would have to have 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.180
 auto or life insurance and other things 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.610
 as they do not transform that is a man 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.759
 it's empty and the day it's like you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.120
 you realized my god for a genius and 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.950
 spoke just discovered another element 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.360
 I always wondered what was the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.630
 true process to train a 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.630
 animal 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.039
 i 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.870
 no no 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.560
 so I train the animals then I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000
 I had not the slightest idea that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.259
 animals train to have a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.820
 good figure I do not know that this becomes a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.820
 little very well training for a duel 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.509
 this pretty I started thinking about the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 men who spend all day in the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.990
 fitness center 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.979
 and the best thing is that you can do many more 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.420
 abdominals that you much more to master 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.349
 that I also but you do not fulfill my 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.640
 I really go to the gym I 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.110
 I distract easily I end up doing 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.110
 something else let's go 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.450
 and it's too late and I have to go and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.010
 more curious than while I was going 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.989
 to the gym watching all those women what 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.920
 only my body was growing but this 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.360
 boy that all children see 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.260
 also but I did not say anything bad what 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.780
 only that I was going to say what I 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.220
 third of Peru if I want you to look 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.940
 this group of a present the cndh already 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.940
 having a good time 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 I had the mind about people enjoying 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.480
 of life singing making a little picture 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.830
 dancing now the interesting thing is that the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.350
 I go here present is not simply 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:05.879
 having fun they are working 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.879
 [Music] 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.900
 a new method that goes against another 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.990
 people now to build the building 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.580
 dancing the song as they build 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.830
 buildings and then explode what are 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.750
 the qualities to look for people with 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.420
 eager to work and that is moving 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.770
 all right 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.970
 in it to plant a beam like you 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.970
 would do to mix mind then 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.060
 and here among us he would give me 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.830
 concentrated on buildings that have made 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.420
 to the rhythm of the metal but then 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.980
 it's an aerial demonstration of a 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.730
 mini-helicopter that can do it said 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.730
 I hope it's interesting 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.919
 [Music] 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.480
 [Applause] 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.480
 I hope all that 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.710
 and one of those who already forgets that but 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.710
 I was talking 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.810
 minimal now this situation 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.400
 [Applause] 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.410
 [Music] 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.820
 and today's question sponsored 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.490
 why do caves because the toilet 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.840
 it sounds ugly when it's downloaded they send that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.370
 it has been all better days today I hope
