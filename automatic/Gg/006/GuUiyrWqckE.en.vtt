think when you only have one there's so
much<00:01:25.910> going<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.270> especially<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:26.990> game

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
much going on especially in this game

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.680 
much going on especially in this game
behind<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.250> play<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:28.970> difficult<00:01:29.479> to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
behind the play and so difficult to

in<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.590> situations<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.220> think<00:01:34.399> he<00:01:34.460> could<00:01:34.580> have
