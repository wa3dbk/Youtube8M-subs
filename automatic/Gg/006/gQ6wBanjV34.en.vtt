see
at<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.690> stage<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.110> know<00:04:19.200> putting<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> kind

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
at this stage you know putting the kind

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.810 
at this stage you know putting the kind
of<00:04:19.620> consumer<00:04:19.860> demo<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.250> people's<00:04:20.490> hands<00:04:20.670> and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
of consumer demo in people's hands and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.950 
of consumer demo in people's hands and
seeing<00:04:21.030> how<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> respond<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:21.660> yeah<00:04:21.810> it's<00:04:21.930> a

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
seeing how to respond so yeah it's a

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.980 
seeing how to respond so yeah it's a
great<00:04:22.110> kind<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.770> end<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.120> project<00:04:24.510> almost

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
great kind of end to the project almost

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.340 
great kind of end to the project almost
end<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:26.420> think<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.630> thing<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:27.780> might<00:04:28.020> make<00:04:28.050> it

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
end I think the thing that might make it

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.510 
end I think the thing that might make it
stick<00:04:28.530> out<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.710> most<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:28.980> me<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.280> story

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
stick out the most of me is the story

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.060 
stick out the most of me is the story
like<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.600> film<00:04:31.200> there's<00:04:31.380> these<00:04:31.470> very<00:04:31.590> rare<00:04:31.860> that

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
like a film there's these very rare that

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.380 
like a film there's these very rare that
like<00:04:32.190> there's<00:04:32.370> been<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> lot<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.700> attempts<00:04:33.300> to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
like there's been a lot of attempts to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.240 
like there's been a lot of attempts to
kind<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.600> do<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.900> was<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.230> true<00:04:34.440> crime<00:04:34.830> story

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
kind of do this was the true crime story

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250 
kind of do this was the true crime story
but<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.730> think<00:04:35.910> they<00:04:36.150> might<00:04:36.330> have<00:04:36.540> like<00:04:36.840> kind<00:04:37.230> of

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
but I think they might have like kind of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.990 
but I think they might have like kind of
the<00:04:37.380> winning<00:04:37.650> formula<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:38.460> really<00:04:38.790> like<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
the winning formula I really like the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.610 
the winning formula I really like the
combat<00:04:39.360> system<00:04:39.510> it's<00:04:40.260> not<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:40.590> a

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
combat system it's not like a

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.800 
combat system it's not like a
traditional<00:04:41.060> shooter<00:04:42.060> as<00:04:42.300> you'd<00:04:42.480> expect<00:04:42.780> from

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
traditional shooter as you'd expect from

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.870 
traditional shooter as you'd expect from
an<00:04:42.960> open-world<00:04:43.230> game<00:04:43.470> they<00:04:43.920> kind<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.430> tend<00:04:44.670> to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
an open-world game they kind of tend to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.340 
an open-world game they kind of tend to
tend<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.420> together<00:04:45.660> but<00:04:45.780> it's<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.960> free<00:04:46.170> play

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
tend to be together but it's a free play

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.160 
tend to be together but it's a free play
system<00:04:46.560> similar<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.100> Batman<00:04:47.550> series<00:04:48.170> so

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
system similar to the Batman series so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.380 
system similar to the Batman series so
yeah<00:04:49.350> lots<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.860> contextual<00:04:50.790> moves<00:04:50.970> against

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
yeah lots of contextual moves against

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.930 
yeah lots of contextual moves against
environments<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.800> offers<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.550> lot<00:04:53.880> of

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
environments it offers a lot of

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.150 
environments it offers a lot of
different<00:04:54.240> kinds<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.660> combat<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.710> driving

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
different kinds of combat and driving

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.460 
different kinds of combat and driving
things<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.820> it's<00:04:56.940> got<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.360> really<00:04:58.020> great<00:04:58.290> world

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
things and it's got a really great world

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.600 
things and it's got a really great world
they've<00:04:58.650> built<00:04:58.890> up<00:04:59.010> it's<00:04:59.250> really<00:04:59.400> colorful

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
they've built up it's really colorful

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.480 
they've built up it's really colorful
which<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.120> cool<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:01.230> it's<00:05:01.590> just<00:05:01.890> yeah<00:05:02.340> it's

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
which is cool and it's just yeah it's

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.740 
which is cool and it's just yeah it's
got<00:05:02.670> it's<00:05:02.820> got<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.970> really<00:05:03.150> edge<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.600> which

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
got it's got a really edge to it which

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.540 
got it's got a really edge to it which
is<00:05:03.900> really<00:05:04.740> impressive<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.190> that's<00:05:05.370> what<00:05:05.490> you

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
is really impressive and that's what you

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.800 
is really impressive and that's what you
want<00:05:05.700> from<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.880> game<00:05:06.000> i<00:05:06.180> think<00:05:06.330> mostly<00:05:06.540> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
want from the game i think mostly the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.230 
want from the game i think mostly the
combat<00:05:07.230> seems<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.590> stuck<00:05:07.830> out<00:05:08.010> most<00:05:08.430> it's

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
combat seems to stuck out most it's

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.320 
combat seems to stuck out most it's
quite<00:05:09.420> free-flowing<00:05:09.900> like<00:05:10.310> Arkham<00:05:11.310> City<00:05:11.520> but

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
quite free-flowing like Arkham City but

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.420 
quite free-flowing like Arkham City but
it's<00:05:12.570> got<00:05:12.780> these<00:05:12.960> quite<00:05:13.350> little<00:05:13.680> finishing

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
it's got these quite little finishing

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.760 
it's got these quite little finishing
moves<00:05:14.730> which<00:05:15.120> kind<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.170> provide<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.620> nice

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
moves which kind of provide a nice

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.910 
moves which kind of provide a nice
closure<00:05:17.070> severe<00:05:17.880> fighting<00:05:18.390> I'd<00:05:19.350> like<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:19.830> have

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
closure severe fighting I'd like to have

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.140 
closure severe fighting I'd like to have
been<00:05:19.980> at<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.280> chance<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.610> play<00:05:20.880> with<00:05:21.030> the
