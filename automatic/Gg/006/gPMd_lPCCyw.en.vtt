00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
them off pretty quickly because the area

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.559 
them off pretty quickly because the area

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
of effect is very big so now a few ani

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.749

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
much harder they are to take down due to

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.190 
much harder they are to take down due to
their<00:01:14.860> high<00:01:14.890> hit<00:01:15.220> points<00:01:15.690> so<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.720> way<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:16.959> take

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
their high hit points so the way to take

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.260 
their high hit points so the way to take
