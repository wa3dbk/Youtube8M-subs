so<00:01:28.050> it's<00:01:28.140> geared<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.380> Texas<00:01:28.800> model<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
so it's geared for Texas model so it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.270 
so it's geared for Texas model so it
really<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> load<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.900> gear<00:01:31.280> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
really doesn't have a load of gear for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
really doesn't have a load of gear for
drag<00:01:32.610> type<00:01:32.910> stuff<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.330> mean<00:01:33.480> it's<00:01:33.600> really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
drag type stuff I mean it's really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
drag type stuff I mean it's really
geared<00:01:34.050> for<00:01:34.140> top<00:01:34.440> speed<00:01:34.770> model<00:01:35.130> runs<00:01:35.340> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
geared for top speed model runs right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
geared for top speed model runs right
so<00:01:36.240> you'll<00:01:36.510> notice<00:01:36.780> it'll<00:01:37.230> hit<00:01:37.440> pretty<00:01:38.400> good

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so you'll notice it'll hit pretty good

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
so you'll notice it'll hit pretty good
and<00:01:38.940> then<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.120> drill<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> hole<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.660> motor<00:01:39.930> block

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then you drill a hole a motor block

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
and then you drill a hole a motor block
ya<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.650> much<00:01:40.800> traction<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.450> then

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
ya got so much traction right and then

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.450 
ya got so much traction right and then
you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.260> hear<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> turbo<00:01:43.680> company<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.250> yeah
