to<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.420> I'm<00:02:26.420> sure<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.630> think<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
to do this is so I'm sure I think the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600 
to do this is so I'm sure I think the
