00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
under do the throws we're kind of
awkwardly<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.570> hand<00:00:36.809> undo

this choice backwards like this you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.660 
this choice backwards like this you
don't<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.309> able<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.550> this

messed<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.469> I'm<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.680> pointing<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.190> out<00:00:44.340> for

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
messed up I'm just pointing this out for

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
messed up I'm just pointing this out for
interestingness<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:47.219> real<00:00:47.370> wait<00:00:47.520> alarm<00:00:47.850> time

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

reverse<00:00:48.300> Mills<00:00:48.539> mess<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.710> probably<00:00:50.100> started

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
reverse Mills mess it's probably started

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
reverse Mills mess it's probably started
with<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:50.700> bulbs<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.570> assuming<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> guys<00:00:52.559> are

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
with two bulbs so assuming you guys are

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
with two bulbs so assuming you guys are
really<00:00:52.800> good<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.010> Mills<00:00:53.219> mess<00:00:53.399> already<00:00:53.610> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
really good at Mills mess already this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.220 
really good at Mills mess already this
is<00:00:54.239> probably<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> need<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
is probably all you need to know to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
is probably all you need to know to
master<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> verse<00:00:55.860> pattern<00:00:56.219> start<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.090> two

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
master the verse pattern start with two

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
master the verse pattern start with two
balls<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.350> regular<00:00:58.739> pattern<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.340> Mills

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
balls and the regular pattern of Mills

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.950 
balls and the regular pattern of Mills
mess<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.180> balls<00:01:00.390> looks<00:01:00.690> something<00:01:00.840> like

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
mess with two balls looks something like

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
mess with two balls looks something like
this<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.219> least<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> possible

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this or at least one of the possible

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
this or at least one of the possible
regular<00:01:03.359> patterns<00:01:04.580> right<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.030> one

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
regular patterns right so you have one

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
regular patterns right so you have one
ball<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.390> each<00:01:06.450> hand<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> throw

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
ball in each hand you're going to throw

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
ball in each hand you're going to throw
your<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:08.010> hand<00:01:08.220> ball<00:01:08.369> over<00:01:08.729> come<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.119> your

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
your right hand ball over come with your

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
your right hand ball over come with your
left<00:01:09.450> hand<00:01:09.630> underneath<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.350> follow<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
left hand underneath and follow it up

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.719 
left hand underneath and follow it up
like<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
like this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
like this
catch<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.510> back<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.409> hands<00:01:13.939> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
catch them back in different hands so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
catch them back in different hands so
this<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> following<00:01:15.810> ball<00:01:16.049> catch

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this would be the following ball catch

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.170 
this would be the following ball catch
both<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> other

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
both of them then you go back the other

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.469 
both of them then you go back the other
way<00:01:18.710> alright<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:20.009> simple<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
way alright pretty simple so what you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
way alright pretty simple so what you
want<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.170> stop<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.590> pattern<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> go

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
want to do is stop this pattern and go

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.210 
want to do is stop this pattern and go
backwards<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.049> instead<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
backwards so now instead of going and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.410 
backwards so now instead of going and
you're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.430> around<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:26.880> throwing

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're going around this way throwing

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
you're going around this way throwing
one<00:01:27.600> together<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> start

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
one together you're going to start

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590 
one together you're going to start
throwing<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.090> ball<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.540> I'm

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
throwing with the other ball so I'm

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.700 
throwing with the other ball so I'm
going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> start<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> right<00:01:31.200> hand<00:01:31.259> going

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to start with the right hand going

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
going to start with the right hand going
outwards<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.390> awkward

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
outwards this is kind of an awkward

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.760 
outwards this is kind of an awkward
throw<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> leading

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
throw but this is actually the leading

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.679 
throw but this is actually the leading
throw<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.400> reversals<00:01:35.970> mess<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
throw of reversals mess so you have to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.910 
throw of reversals mess so you have to
make<00:01:36.810> sure<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> throw<00:01:37.680> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
make sure you have this throw very

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
make sure you have this throw very
strongly<00:01:38.360> mastered<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.869> leave

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
strongly mastered so that you can leave

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.510 
strongly mastered so that you can leave
the<00:01:40.200> pattern<00:01:40.500> outwards<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.070> both<00:01:41.250> sides

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the pattern outwards on both sides

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
the pattern outwards on both sides
otherwise<00:01:41.909> we'll<00:01:42.060> end<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.360> crushed<00:01:42.600> up

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
otherwise we'll end up all crushed up

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.880 
otherwise we'll end up all crushed up
with<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> middle<00:01:43.110> I'll<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.560> back<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
with the middle I'll get back to this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
with the middle I'll get back to this
later<00:01:44.040> anyways<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.329> the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.330 
left hand out this way you're going to
know<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> pad<00:02:01.920> would<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.189> something

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
know that the pad would look something

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.330 
know that the pad would look something
like<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
like this

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.170 
like this
practice<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> while<00:02:05.790> until<00:02:05.939> you're

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
practice this for a while until you're

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.340 
practice this for a while until you're
really<00:02:06.270> comfortable<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.840> make<00:02:07.140> sure<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
really comfortable with it make sure the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.389 
really comfortable with it make sure the
balls<00:02:07.530> look<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.770> they're<00:02:08.009> following<00:02:08.310> each

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
balls look like they're following each

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.190 
balls look like they're following each
other<00:02:08.489> smoothly<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> forward

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
other smoothly as in the forward

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
other smoothly as in the forward
and<00:02:10.289> make<00:02:10.890> sure<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.400> outwards<00:02:11.730> throws

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and make sure that your outwards throws

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.789 
and make sure that your outwards throws
go<00:02:12.330> far<00:02:12.569> enough<00:02:12.840> out<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.260> side<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.739> it

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
go far enough out to the side so it

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.360 
go far enough out to the side so it
looks<00:02:13.950> nice

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
looks nice

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.860 
looks nice
okay<00:02:15.269> now<00:02:15.930> you'll<00:02:16.049> start<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.349> notice<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.920> as

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
okay now you'll start to notice that as

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.979 
okay now you'll start to notice that as
as<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.760> underhand<00:02:21.420> throw<00:02:21.510> that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
as you do the underhand throw that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.289 
as you do the underhand throw that
follows<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> first<00:02:22.650> ball<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:23.760> hand<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
follows the first ball your hand that

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.520 
follows the first ball your hand that
does<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> first<00:02:24.780> throw<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.440> move

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
does the first throw is going to move

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.080 
does the first throw is going to move
over<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.069> top<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> underhand<00:02:26.849> arm

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
over on top of the underhand arm

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.479 
over on top of the underhand arm
obviously<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:27.930> watch<00:02:28.079> my<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.349> hand<00:02:28.560> there

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
obviously so watch my right hand there

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.220 
obviously so watch my right hand there
that's<00:02:30.299> where<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> third<00:02:30.750> ball<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.049> going<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that's where the third ball is going to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.750 
that's where the third ball is going to
fit<00:02:31.409> now<00:02:31.530> you're<00:02:31.650> simply<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.459> throw<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
fit now you're simply going to throw it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.550 
fit now you're simply going to throw it
out<00:02:32.879> after<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.659> other<00:02:33.780> two<00:02:33.989> following<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
out after the other two following the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.740 
out after the other two following the
same<00:02:34.739> mark<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.459> it'll<00:02:35.579> be<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.819> two<00:02:35.849> three<00:02:36.030> one

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
same mark so it'll be one two three one

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.520 
same mark so it'll be one two three one
two<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:37.019> three<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:39.079> so<00:02:40.079> in<00:02:40.200> order<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.379> do

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
two or three like that so in order to do

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.640 
two or three like that so in order to do
the<00:02:40.620> full<00:02:40.890> reverse<00:02:41.730> move<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.060> that's<00:02:42.150> pattern

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
the full reverse move on that's pattern

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
the full reverse move on that's pattern
start<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.769> two<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.040> your<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.250> hand<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.609> on

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
start with two in your right hand one on

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.050 
start with two in your right hand one on
your<00:02:44.790> left

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
your left

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
your left
start<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.959> same<00:02:46.140> slantways<00:02:46.680> outwards

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
start with the same slantways outwards

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.650 
start with the same slantways outwards
throat<00:02:47.340> follow<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:47.910> left<00:02:48.120> underhand

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
throat follow it with the left underhand

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.849 
throat follow it with the left underhand
and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.019> your<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.290> hands<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> toss

and then your right hands going to toss

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:50.569 
and then your right hands going to toss
one<00:02:50.099> after<00:02:50.430> it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
one after it

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.930 
one after it
the<00:02:50.819> third<00:02:51.030> ball<00:02:51.239> from<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.019> top<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.250> so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the third ball from on top like that so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.539 
the third ball from on top like that so
one<00:02:54.329> two<00:02:54.780> three<00:02:54.859> then<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:56.010> course<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.340> end<00:02:56.370> up

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
one two three then of course you end up

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.589 
one two three then of course you end up
back<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.909> pattern<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.269> left<00:02:57.450> hand

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
back on this pattern the left hand

smooth I'm not even that close to smooth
I<00:03:09.120> still<00:03:09.329> think<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.569> looks<00:03:09.599> ugly<00:03:10.109> but<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:11.099> a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I still think it looks ugly but it's a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.860 
I still think it looks ugly but it's a
very<00:03:11.519> awkward<00:03:11.670> pattern<00:03:12.150> since<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.629> literally

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
very awkward pattern since you literally

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.569 
very awkward pattern since you literally
have<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> feeling<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.680> China<00:03:14.069> chasing<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
have the feeling of China chasing the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.650 
have the feeling of China chasing the
ball<00:03:14.700> around<00:03:14.910> such<00:03:15.180> you're<00:03:15.299> going<00:03:15.450> backwards

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
ball around such you're going backwards

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.879 
ball around such you're going backwards
it's<00:03:16.380> very<00:03:16.560> bizarre

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
it's very bizarre

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.379 
it's very bizarre
I<00:03:17.099> think<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.639> of<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.760> keys<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> getting<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
I think one of the keys to getting it

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.180 
I think one of the keys to getting it
right<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> make<00:03:19.109> sure<00:03:19.139> that<00:03:19.319> outwards<00:03:20.069> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
right is to make sure that outwards to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.379 
right is to make sure that outwards to
afar<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:20.970> don't<00:03:21.180> watch<00:03:21.359> what

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
afar because if you don't watch what

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.289 
afar because if you don't watch what
happens<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:23.579> end<00:03:23.609> up<00:03:23.849> in<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> kind<00:03:24.209> of

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
happens you end up in a kind of

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:24.949 
happens you end up in a kind of
weird-looking

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
weird-looking

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.229 
weird-looking
Boston<00:03:25.650> s<00:03:25.889> type<00:03:26.190> thing<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.879> really<00:03:27.090> doesn't

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
Boston s type thing it really doesn't

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.879 
Boston s type thing it really doesn't
look<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> flowing<00:03:27.840> Mills<00:03:28.049> mess<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.769> want

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
look like a flowing Mills mess so I want

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.289 
look like a flowing Mills mess so I want
to<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:29.040> sure<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.250> Fargo<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.700> horizontal

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
to make sure that Fargo is horizontal

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
to make sure that Fargo is horizontal
enough<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:31.139> lead<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> balls<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.220> each

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
enough to lead the balls out to each

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.509 
enough to lead the balls out to each
side<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> clear<00:03:34.079> figure<00:03:34.799> 8<00:03:34.980> type<00:03:35.280> thing

side and get a clear figure 8 type thing
going<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:38.359> after<00:03:39.359> that<00:03:39.480> as<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.660> said<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
going on after that as I said the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:40.970 
going on after that as I said the
sensation<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.410> really<00:03:40.560> I've<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.949> of

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
sensation is really I've just kind of

sensation is really I've just kind of
