00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.749 
interesting theory i'm gonna test you
guys<00:01:22.630> watch<00:01:22.869> this<00:01:23.079> full<00:01:23.439> theory<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.280> full<00:01:24.579> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
guys watch this full theory is full the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.740 
guys watch this full theory is full the
rest<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:24.969> the<00:01:25.030> video<00:01:25.270> because<00:01:25.540> there's<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.719> lot

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
going to want to miss about how there

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.810 
going to want to miss about how there
could<00:01:28.840> be<00:01:28.899> another<00:01:29.170> call<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.680> game<00:01:29.860> which

could be in the modern warfare series
coming<00:01:32.829> soon<00:01:32.979> I<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:34.360> guys<00:01:34.509> sledgehammer<00:01:35.229> this

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
coming soon I so guys sledgehammer this

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.990 
coming soon I so guys sledgehammer this
is<00:01:35.770> my<00:01:35.920> prediction<00:01:36.100> sledgehammer<00:01:36.880> is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
is my prediction sledgehammer is

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.370 
is my prediction sledgehammer is
possibly<00:01:37.420> going<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> be<00:01:37.750> making<00:01:37.899> em<00:01:38.229> two

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
possibly going to be making em two

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.730 
possibly going to be making em two
before<00:01:38.710> between<00:01:39.600> 2014<00:01:40.600> or<00:01:40.750> 2015<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.350> could<00:01:41.619> be

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
before between 2014 or 2015 I could be

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.020 
before between 2014 or 2015 I could be
dead<00:01:41.950> wrong<00:01:42.159> about<00:01:42.219> this<00:01:42.549> but<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.789> have<00:01:42.909> some

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
dead wrong about this but I have some

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.310 
dead wrong about this but I have some
interesting<00:01:43.299> proof<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.869> guys<00:01:44.020> are

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
interesting proof that you guys are

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.590 
interesting proof that you guys are

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
really don't wanna listen to so the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.050 
really don't wanna listen to so the
biggest<00:01:46.869> role<00:01:47.049> in<00:01:47.200> mw3<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.979> an<00:01:48.159> i<00:01:48.340> w-was<00:01:49.000> a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
biggest role in mw3 is an i w-was a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.849 
biggest role in mw3 is an i w-was a

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
falling apart was selection where they

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.560 
falling apart was selection where they
had<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> huge<00:01:51.100> part<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:52.030> think<00:01:52.240> they<00:01:52.329> came

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
had a huge part that I think they came

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.539 
had a huge part that I think they came
in<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:52.930> there<00:01:53.109> was<00:01:53.200> 20<00:01:53.500> months<00:01:53.740> left<00:01:53.950> for

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
release and that all this happened

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.649 
release and that all this happened
Infinity<00:01:57.670> Ward<00:01:57.909> was<00:01:58.060> falling<00:01:58.299> apart<00:01:58.390> because

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659

another you know four five and six and
that<00:05:11.259> was<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.530> first<00:05:11.560> step<00:05:11.889> but<00:05:12.520> due<00:05:12.759> to<00:05:12.789> a<00:05:12.909> lot

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
that was the first step but due to a lot

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.360 
that was the first step but due to a lot
of<00:05:13.690> changes<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.169> wanted<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.500> make<00:05:14.919> with<00:05:15.190> this

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.019 
I guess they were way back they they
didn't<00:05:50.889> have<00:05:51.009> a<00:05:51.039> lot<00:05:51.279> produced<00:05:51.610> because<00:05:51.789> the

didn't have a lot produced because the

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.580 
didn't have a lot produced because the
lawsuits<00:05:52.509> and<00:05:52.659> fights<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.080> stuff<00:05:53.259> and

bit<00:06:36.909> possible<00:06:37.839> that<00:06:38.370> modern<00:06:39.370> warfare<00:06:39.550> is<00:06:39.759> just

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
bit possible that modern warfare is just

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.790 
bit possible that modern warfare is just
going<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:40.120> end<00:06:40.389> it's<00:06:41.080> just<00:06:41.349> too<00:06:41.710> huge<00:06:42.310> n

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
going to end it's just too huge n

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.589 
going to end it's just too huge n
and<00:06:43.069> I<00:06:43.370> think<00:06:43.580> they<00:06:43.699> could<00:06:43.879> build<00:06:44.090> on<00:06:44.389> this

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
and I think they could build on this

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.629 
and I think they could build on this
story<00:06:44.900> you<00:06:45.470> know<00:06:45.620> there's<00:06:45.830> obviously<00:06:46.340> I've

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
story you know there's obviously I've

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.249 
story you know there's obviously I've
had<00:06:46.819> my<00:06:46.970> theories<00:06:47.330> in<00:06:47.479> the<00:06:47.569> past<00:06:47.780> that<00:06:47.990> ghosts

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
had my theories in the past that ghosts

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:49.869 
had my theories in the past that ghosts
could<00:06:48.560> come<00:06:48.710> back<00:06:48.860> to<00:06:49.009> life<00:06:49.159> there's<00:06:49.400> I'm<00:06:49.580> sure

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
could come back to life there's I'm sure

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.909 
could come back to life there's I'm sure
they<00:06:50.000> can<00:06:50.150> build<00:06:50.360> on<00:06:50.569> it<00:06:50.750> and<00:06:50.930> I<00:06:51.379> would<00:06:51.530> love<00:06:51.770> to
