is called the differential because it

complicated<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:13.320> once<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.799> understand<00:00:14.400> its

complicated but once we understand its

complicated but once we understand its
principle<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> amazingly<00:00:16.529> simple<00:00:17.060> these

let's fasten a spoke on the inner end of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.790 
let's fasten a spoke on the inner end of
each<00:00:32.610> axle<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.040> by<00:00:35.190> turning<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.700> spokes

each axle so that by turning the spokes

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.229 
each axle so that by turning the spokes
we<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:38.040> turn<00:00:38.309> each<00:00:38.670> wheel<00:00:38.969> separately<00:00:44.210> with<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we can turn each wheel separately with a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.950 
we can turn each wheel separately with a
bar<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:45.989> cross<00:00:46.440> piece<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.390> turn<00:00:48.629> both

wheels in the same direction at the same
rate<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.250> speed<00:00:54.140> let's<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
rate of speed let's get something to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490 
rate of speed let's get something to
hold<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> bar<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.760> place<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> will

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
hold this bar in place so that it will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.670 
hold this bar in place so that it will
press<00:00:58.829> against<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> spokes

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
press against the spokes

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
press against the spokes
notice<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.070> support<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:03.059> locked

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
notice that this support is not locked

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.270 
notice that this support is not locked
to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> axle<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.830> turns<00:01:05.220> freely<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:08.040> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to the axle it turns freely now we can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.230 
to the axle it turns freely now we can
spin<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> wheels<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.689> rotating<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> support

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
spin the wheels by rotating the support

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
spin the wheels by rotating the support
this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.479> fine<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.110> long<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.950> both<00:01:14.430> wheels<00:01:14.760> are

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this is fine as long as both wheels are

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.950 
this is fine as long as both wheels are
able<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> turn<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> same<00:01:16.110> speed<00:01:16.820> but<00:01:17.960> let's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
able to turn at the same speed but let's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
able to turn at the same speed but let's
see<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.350> happens<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.369> around<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
see what happens when we go around the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.289 
see what happens when we go around the
corner<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> arrangement<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.850> cannot

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
corner with this arrangement we cannot

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.190 
corner with this arrangement we cannot
drive<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.990> wheel<00:01:25.290> faster<00:01:26.220> than<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> other

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.840 

and<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> stop<00:01:32.580> one<00:01:33.119> wheel<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.460> wheel

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and if we stop one wheel the other wheel

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
and if we stop one wheel the other wheel
won't<00:01:36.180> budge<00:01:38.810> let's<00:01:39.810> put<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:40.229> bar<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
won't budge let's put this bar on a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.719 
won't budge let's put this bar on a
pivot<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.770> swing<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.460> either

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pivot so that it can swing in either

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:54.410 
pivot so that it can swing in either
direction<00:01:50.600> now<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:53.250> bar<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.759> still<00:01:54.090> turn

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
direction now the bar can still turn

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.060 
direction now the bar can still turn
both<00:01:54.720> wheels<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.979> same<00:01:56.250> speed<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
both wheels at the same speed and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.770 
both wheels at the same speed and
because<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.399> pivots<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:01.080> lets<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.680> wheel<00:02:01.979> turn

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
because it pivots it lets one wheel turn

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.669 
because it pivots it lets one wheel turn
even<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.289> other<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.679> stopped<00:02:05.810> but<00:02:06.810> if

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
even when the other is stopped but if

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.750 
even when the other is stopped but if
turned<00:02:08.100> too<00:02:08.369> far<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.630> bar<00:02:09.899> will<00:02:10.170> swing<00:02:10.470> around

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
turned too far the bar will swing around

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.250 
turned too far the bar will swing around
until<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> won't<00:02:12.150> drive<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.600> spokes<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
wide spaces between the spokes we will

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.290 
wide spaces between the spokes we will
put<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.359> more<00:03:00.750> spokes
