The 24rd magazine has full markings!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The gun is pretty light, and has good ergonomics

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It is compatible with Tokyo Marui magazines

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Rapid fire is pretty smooth, but the long trigger can make you trip up a bit

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It comes with unique 4 dot sights (3 in the back, 1 in front) that are unpainted

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.500
I find the trigger quite troublesome, as the safety extends too far, but the reset is pretty decent

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.000
~Squeaky safety! (can be easily fixed with a drop of silicone oil)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.960
Even though the gun cycles fine, the slide racking is not smooth

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
Maybe this will get better over time?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.000
Here's a closer view of the slide scratching against the outer barrel (rubs off the paint)
