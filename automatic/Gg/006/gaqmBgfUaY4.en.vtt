00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going for about 12 k at the moment but

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.810 
going for about 12 k at the moment but
anyway<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:46.379> came<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.039> pink<00:00:47.309> extra<00:00:47.760> on

is<00:02:30.630> cuz<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.870> actually<00:02:31.340> investing<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.490> about

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
is cuz I'm actually investing in about

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
is cuz I'm actually investing in about
four<00:02:32.910> or<00:02:32.940> five<00:02:33.060> BPL<00:02:33.810> players<00:02:34.050> hopefully<00:02:34.440> they

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
four or five BPL players hopefully they

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280 
four or five BPL players hopefully they
will<00:02:34.740> rise<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.570> early<00:02:36.570> access<00:02:36.750> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
will rise with the early access but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.510 
will rise with the early access but
anyways<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.870> centered<00:02:39.890> defensive<00:02:40.890> mid<00:02:41.070> 90

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.930 
chemical a comment and i believe that is
something<00:03:43.769> look<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:44.340> all<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.610> stats

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
something look you can see all the stats

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.020 
something look you can see all the stats
here<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:46.080> got<00:03:46.260> up<00:03:46.410> not<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.220> boil<00:03:47.400> stats<00:03:47.790> but

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
here it's got up not to boil stats but

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.470 
here it's got up not to boil stats but
93<00:03:48.870> stamina<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.470> 86<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.370> acceleration<00:03:51.239> with

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
93 stamina and 86 to acceleration with

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.960 
93 stamina and 86 to acceleration with
nice<00:03:51.690> x<00:03:51.959> print<00:03:52.350> speed<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.799> think<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.280> sums<00:03:53.790> up

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
nice x print speed I think that sums up

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.690 
nice x print speed I think that sums up
how<00:03:54.450> good<00:03:55.049> display<00:03:55.440> could<00:03:55.739> be<00:03:55.950> three<00:03:56.489> some

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
how good display could be three some

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.729 
how good display could be three some
sample<00:03:59.700> wherever<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.090> we're<00:04:00.209> gonna<00:04:00.330> call<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
sample wherever that we're gonna call it

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.680 
sample wherever that we're gonna call it
so<00:04:01.739> he's<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> sentiment<00:04:02.610> if<00:04:02.820> he<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.090> 200<00:04:03.540> coins

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
so he's a sentiment if he is 200 coins

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.750 
so he's a sentiment if he is 200 coins
and<00:04:03.959> i'll<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.320> making<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.040> much<00:04:05.250> money<00:04:05.310> off<00:04:05.580> his

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and i'll be making so much money off his

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.150 
and i'll be making so much money off his
player<00:04:06.170> but<00:04:07.170> now<00:04:07.440> he's<00:04:07.620> going<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.830> be<00:04:07.890> 200

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
player but now he's going to be 200

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.460 
player but now he's going to be 200
coins<00:04:08.250> maybe<00:04:08.580> our<00:04:08.820> k<00:04:09.120> maybe<00:04:09.840> even<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.170> bit<00:04:10.200> more

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
coins maybe our k maybe even a bit more

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.950 
coins maybe our k maybe even a bit more
and

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960

for<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.560> bit<00:05:21.680> more<00:05:21.920> but<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.340> would<00:05:22.490> be<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.670> risk

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
for a bit more but it would be a risk

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.480 
for a bit more but it would be a risk
someone's<00:05:24.140> gonna<00:05:24.260> hide<00:05:25.070> black<00:05:25.280> but

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
someone's gonna hide black but

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.280 
someone's gonna hide black but
it<00:05:26.000> would<00:05:26.180> be<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.360> risk<00:05:26.540> trying<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.960> price<00:05:27.140> for

would<00:05:29.540> recommend<00:05:30.020> price<00:05:30.170> fixing<00:05:30.500> people<00:05:30.800> were

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
would recommend price fixing people were

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.880 
would recommend price fixing people were
below<00:05:31.670> two<00:05:32.000> thousand<00:05:32.480> coins<00:05:32.630> but<00:05:33.260> this<00:05:33.620> guy<00:05:33.830> i
