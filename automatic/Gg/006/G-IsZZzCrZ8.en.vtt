Marquez kept landing himself open he
went<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.600> three<00:01:13.470> times<00:01:13.820> thing<00:01:14.820> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
went down I think three times thing was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
went down I think three times thing was
three<00:01:15.150> times<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.900> least<00:01:15.960> fight<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
three times at least fight was a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
WBA I think and her not Marquez it was a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.810 
WBA I think and her not Marquez it was a
WBO<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:25.100> something<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.700> yeah

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and final thoughts about because I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359 
and final thoughts about because I
thought<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.490> her<00:01:41.939> non<00:01:42.119> Marquez<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
thought that her non Marquez I know I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
thought that her non Marquez I know I
knew<00:01:44.549> both<00:01:44.850> guys<00:01:45.060> were<00:01:45.240> powerful<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
knew both guys were powerful but I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.249 
knew both guys were powerful but I
thought<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> marquez<00:01:47.490> youth<00:01:48.259> younger

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
thought the marquez youth younger

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.190 
thought the marquez youth younger
younger<00:01:49.649> age<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.310> give<00:01:50.700> him<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.119> power

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
younger age will give him more power

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
younger age will give him more power
puncher<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.100> him<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> stronger

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
puncher like will make him a stronger

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
puncher like will make him a stronger
puncher<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> can't<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.280> but

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
puncher then I can't think right now but

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.569 
puncher then I can't think right now but
yeah<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:58.100> he<00:01:59.100> he<00:02:00.090> did<00:02:00.270> hurt<00:02:00.420> Brian<00:02:00.659> Viloria

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
