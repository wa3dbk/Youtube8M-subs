 a horizon of a foamed natural maize 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.730
 we already hear many 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830
 industrial criticism has risen 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.759
 against this innovation so simple it 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.009

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.290
 but the mushroom shape is no longer 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 used by industrialists 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.500
 especially that we are still in the robert
