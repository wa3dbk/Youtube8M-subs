00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.850
 hello and welcome on the muppets 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.990
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.250
 my command 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.640
 my last order from home 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.430
 find cup is an organic brand with 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.320
 great bamboo academy and so that's 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.970
 a French brand in general is 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.610
 Made in Italy 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.410
 here I showed you my small purchases 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.449
 so I wear the lip polish all 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.289
 last who just got out so 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.079
 that they hear this reaches so 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.850
 it's lee-of-memory wine and so that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.340
 these 0.31 but there is only one for 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.160
 the moment and so it comes under 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.140
 ice form but it really does 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.640
 lip gloss is not sticky and 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.969
 so it lasts a long time on 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.360
 lips 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.680
 it makes a burgundy color got away 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.180
 to the violin it's absolutely 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.540
 beautiful and at the same time it does not 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.879
 red 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.700
 so I really love the colors I 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.059
 was wearing very second I think then 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.799
 I ordered a lipstick that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.609
 last collection there so it's the 468 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.499
 so here it is really a violin 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:14.079
 I spent my level 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:15.729
 this is the true color it is 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.039
 really beautiful on the lips he is 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.849
 not ready to do it is very 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.829
 pigmented but it is very smooth there 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.950
 really texture lip balm c1 it's 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.609
 a treat is a comfort really I 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.840
 love them lipsticks 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.749
 so that's for lipsticks 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.999
 then I offered myself the cup pallet 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.159
 who is really really super mali 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:44.560
 so who in bamboo too and so there is 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.259
 a mirror so very very low 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 see my installation so very beautiful 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.009
 mirror and so we can put so there 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.429
 it's a fan of michael punke i'm coming 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.169

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.749
 so I bought the refill 

00:01:53.169 --> 00:02:00.459
 so that's the meaning one way there and it's 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.219
 the one that I wear on the smell the 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:07.270
 chapel without having it's really a 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:10.810
 clear glass glass it is very very 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.640
 beautiful so to gray very very beautiful and there 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.290
 it's me faro nibi garden that make 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.990
 in which are the size of the lighthouses mac 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.420
 and some of the lighthouses but kobe 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.490
 so you can put in total I 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.880
 think you can weapons and 8 in the 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.370
 palette 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.470
 so it's really a super pretty 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.150
 pallet she is well magnetized is the same 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.400
 it's the same system as the others and 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.910
 there are magnets in fact there I the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 really looks great and I think 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.340
 I will buy some because I 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.950
 find very very beautiful and to offer 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.080
 it's nice too and she 's not very 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.320
 thick so that's cool that I like 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 many and fargues the state could 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.940
 darken on women me I believe that 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 it's my favorite lighthouse husband and 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.400
 then I have not tested yet but I 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.630
 bought three varnishes that's what they have 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.600
 out of varnish and not long 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.820
 so I bought a matte plum color 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.010
 so the 151 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.910
 that's how it looks like there's the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.710
 sublime dress 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.220
 I can not wait to try it and I watched 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.880
 a little brushes they look wide 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.790
 it really looks great to apply 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.360
 I can not wait to try then I bought 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.850
 a nude 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.680
 so that's called 655 which carries 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.320
 the number 655 it's really it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 is called better than I believe and that's 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.120
 finished I think it defines cream all 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 both and then I bought a top 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.410
 matte coat 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.120
 here to try and so it's 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.190
 conveniences of 8000 liters anyway 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.740
 so it's not bad so 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.630
 well I bought this brand on the same 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.230
 site that 1 times on my pure nature 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.640
 I took advantage of -15% 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.800
 I think it's an omega brand 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.720
 little extra so I can not wait to test the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.270
 varnish anyway I'll talk to you again 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.170
 all that really fast 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.360
 here 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.569
 I make you fat big kisses I you 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.569
