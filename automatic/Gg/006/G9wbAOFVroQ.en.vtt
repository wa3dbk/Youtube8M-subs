00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.289
 well also never with all the 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.700
 I have to give you a piece of 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.990
 carburetor so that they work the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.680
 pique bomb and to kill you without 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.950
 functioning 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.410
 as you will see here I have 3 pique bomb 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.920
 they have to notice the three with 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.920
 different 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.410
 Here is the thread what I told you 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.410
 some start from here 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.860
 I only know of a thread of thread 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.810
 all for the pump 500 outside his 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.690
 travel there we would be pulling to 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.740
 fuel from myself I see a 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 butterfly 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.820
 until the end a jet is even 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.100
 a good flow 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 here we would be with a high consumption and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.710
 maybe a rate or 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 some is important from the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 start of the march in addition to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.559
 vehicle 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.329
 if we adjust it a little bit 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.490
 but let's go taking what is going to 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 do is 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.920
 alarms in the fuel sector 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.310
 it is with just a little bit of we take out 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 with an open butterfly room starts 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.659
 to inject a uniform stream to the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 end of fuel 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.189
 that's where we have to be 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.750
 symptoms we spend a lot of thread what 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.750
 we adjust too much we are going to have one 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.940
 in the jet 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.550
 tiny 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.270
 and from the means to capture the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.630
 butterfly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.530
 here we would be very thin of fuel 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.540
 the car would be like a slug would not have 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.600
 the performance that we have to have 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.190
 you estimate an economic carburetor then 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.450
 a charger that the car is doing well but 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.830
 the naphtha adapts it once again said no 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.570
 I know where you put so tan until the close 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.810
 well this is coach what 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.619
 it's not to consume me it's a car 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.040
 I love car but 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.310
 and that to later in each one 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.360
 the issue is that we are going to develop it 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 and stop 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.310
 about three or four screaming screams 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.910
 is already showing a good jet 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.450
 to a quarter at the height of butterfly by 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.380
 we had to start there 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.380
 we should be fine 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.600
 with the theme of what carbides say 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.970
 you are all tricks to start for 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.770
 to locate to know where they are 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.290
 unemployed 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.950
 for example with the mixing screw 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.000
 they tell you adjusted everything and get it out of two 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.700
 and a half laps and then starts having 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 little more a little less for the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.580
 lens and lawton with this the same thing that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.890
 be at 90 degrees the lever with respect 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.310
 to the lever of the pique pump with 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.340
 Regarding the base of the carburetor or 180 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.680
 the lever with the cap understand that it is 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.070
 all in one line all in one 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.070
 same line but these are all 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 Terrorist deceptions tell you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 at school 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.900
 but then in practice you use it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.190
 little is to split it more to have a 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.910
 orientation of more or less where 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.910
 have to be 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.910
 so good up here this time
