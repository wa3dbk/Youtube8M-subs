00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.610 

I<00:00:36.380> figure<00:00:37.280> consistency<00:00:38.210> was<00:00:38.420> my<00:00:38.630> main<00:00:39.079> wood

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
I figure consistency was my main wood

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.830 
I figure consistency was my main wood
thing<00:00:39.980> with<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.550> recent<00:00:40.910> indirect<00:00:41.390> roster

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.380 
met consistently last place that is so
we<00:00:45.710> figured<00:00:46.040> we'd<00:00:46.280> build<00:00:46.520> our<00:00:46.670> own<00:00:46.790> little

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
we figured we'd build our own little

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.200 
we figured we'd build our own little
tracks<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:48.170> keep<00:00:48.559> our<00:00:48.770> humiliation<00:00:49.210> private

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
tracks and keep our humiliation private

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.750 
tracks and keep our humiliation private
instead<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.870> public

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.709 
seriously though it's good having a
little<00:00:59.980> track<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.399> practice<00:01:00.879> on<00:01:01.089> this<00:01:01.359> just<00:01:01.600> so

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
guy who's had fur pees a lot Pete said

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.780 
guy who's had fur pees a lot Pete said
yes<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.230> we've<00:01:29.440> got<00:01:29.650> our<00:01:29.800> herpetologists

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
yes so we've got our herpetologists

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.850 
yes so we've got our herpetologists
making<00:01:31.210> his<00:01:31.300> first<00:01:31.660> incision<00:01:32.050> like<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
making his first incision like the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.020 
making his first incision like the
things<00:01:33.070> tougher<00:01:33.400> than<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.610> thought

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
things tougher than I thought

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.780

mate<00:01:34.210> are<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.510> qualified<00:01:35.080> said<00:01:35.380> yes<00:01:35.790> there

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
mate are you a qualified said yes there

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.510 
mate are you a qualified said yes there
we<00:01:36.880> go<00:01:37.030> looks<00:01:37.690> like<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.869> time<00:01:38.100> cane<00:01:39.100> toads<00:01:39.400> are

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
we go looks like a time cane toads are

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.700 
we go looks like a time cane toads are
poisonous<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.240> that's<00:01:40.600> what<00:01:40.900> killed<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.470> poor

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
poisonous so that's what killed the poor

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.969 
poisonous so that's what killed the poor
old<00:01:41.890> bugger<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.140> say<00:01:44.350> they're<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> bigger

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979

wheel non-stop the way he was earlier
your<00:03:16.610> idea<00:03:16.970> was<00:03:17.150> just<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.480> drop<00:03:17.750> 2<00:03:18.020> psi<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:18.709> a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
your idea was just to drop 2 psi at a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.040 
your idea was just to drop 2 psi at a
time<00:03:19.190> but<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.000> really<00:03:20.180> hot<00:03:20.420> weather<00:03:20.720> and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
time but it was really hot weather and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.260 
time but it was really hot weather and
we're<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:21.410> feeling<00:03:21.830> pretty<00:03:21.860> tired<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.730> he

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
we're all feeling pretty tired so he

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.970 
we're all feeling pretty tired so he
just<00:03:23.510> went<00:03:23.630> back<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> his<00:03:24.290> usual<00:03:24.500> xi<00:03:25.130> or<00:03:25.459> psi

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
just went back to his usual xi or psi

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.699 
just went back to his usual xi or psi
he's<00:03:27.980> not<00:03:28.190> wheel<00:03:28.459> spinning<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.150> there<00:03:29.420> anymore

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
Pete main problem though it was being

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.140 
Pete main problem though it was being
shown<00:03:38.870> up<00:03:39.080> by<00:03:39.260> his<00:03:39.440> wife<00:03:39.739> she's<00:03:40.700> had<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.880> back

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
shown up by his wife she's had a back

shown up by his wife she's had a back
injury<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.630> hasn't<00:03:42.019> been<00:03:42.140> on<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.410> bike<00:03:42.590> for

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
injury and hasn't been on the bike for

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.190 
injury and hasn't been on the bike for
months<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.459> was<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> first<00:03:44.030> time<00:03:44.330> out<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.930> she

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
months this was a first time out and she

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.620 
months this was a first time out and she
was<00:03:45.350> cutting<00:03:45.650> laps<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.760> many<00:03:47.000> seconds

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
was cutting laps not that many seconds

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.740 
was cutting laps not that many seconds
longer<00:03:47.900> than<00:03:48.110> his<00:03:48.470> word

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.960 

this<00:03:56.620> whole<00:03:56.890> thing<00:03:57.070> about<00:03:57.250> setting<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.760> loop

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
this whole thing about setting a loop

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.240 
this whole thing about setting a loop
and<00:03:58.150> practicing<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.020> works<00:03:59.320> really<00:03:59.860> well

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
and practicing that works really well

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.520 
and practicing that works really well
and<00:04:01.240> we<00:04:01.420> figure<00:04:01.720> we're<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:01.960> to<00:04:02.050> start<00:04:02.290> doing

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
and we figure we're going to start doing

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.440 
and we figure we're going to start doing
this<00:04:02.800> more<00:04:03.070> off<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.490> it's<00:04:03.610> really<00:04:03.910> good<00:04:04.240> being

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
this more off and it's really good being

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.060 
this more off and it's really good being
out<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.570> measure<00:04:04.870> your<00:04:05.170> times<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.800> actually

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
out of measure your times and actually

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.700 
out of measure your times and actually
see<00:04:06.700> if<00:04:07.030> you're<00:04:07.240> doing<00:04:07.390> better<00:04:07.720> or<00:04:07.930> not<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
see if you're doing better or not and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.530 
see if you're doing better or not and
one<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.010> big<00:04:09.220> things<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:10.150> when<00:04:10.330> we

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
one of the big things was that when we

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.690 
one of the big things was that when we
actually<00:04:10.660> relaxed<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.740> backed<00:04:11.950> off<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.220> pace

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
actually relaxed and backed off the pace

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.810 
actually relaxed and backed off the pace
the<00:04:13.540> speed<00:04:13.840> didn't<00:04:14.230> drop<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.590> all<00:04:14.740> so<00:04:15.610> for

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
the speed didn't drop it all so for

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.120 
the speed didn't drop it all so for
starters<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.420> suggests<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.410> pacing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
starters that suggests that pacing

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.190 
starters that suggests that pacing
