00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.250 
hits on this thing alright so we're
going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.060> starting<00:00:24.390> off<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.869> 15

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to be starting off here the 15

going to be starting off here the 15
yard<00:00:25.500> line

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
yard line

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
yard line
already<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.750> 15<00:00:28.320> yards<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:31.679> keep

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
already so here we are 15 yards and keep

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.740 
already so here we are 15 yards and keep
in<00:00:32.009> mind<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> does<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.210> any<00:00:33.420> sort

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
in mind that this does not have any sort

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.420 
in mind that this does not have any sort
of<00:00:33.840> sight<00:00:34.110> system<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> I'm<00:00:34.920> simply<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of sight system on it I'm simply just

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
of sight system on it I'm simply just
looking<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> RHIB<00:00:42.320> yeah<00:00:43.320> both<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> those

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
looking down the RHIB yeah both of those

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
looking down the RHIB yeah both of those
hit<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> 25<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
hit here we are out to the 25 and the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
hit here we are out to the 25 and the
correction<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> last<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.480> second

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
correction on that last one that second

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.920 
correction on that last one that second
shot<00:00:48.899> did<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> left<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> target

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
shot did go to the left of the target

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
shot did go to the left of the target
honestly<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> me

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
honestly I think that was a kind of me

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
honestly I think that was a kind of me
anticipating<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> recoil<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.780> let's<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.050> if

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
anticipating the recoil so let's see if

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.549 
anticipating the recoil so let's see if
we<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.289> him<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.469> target<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.860> 25<00:00:57.170> all<00:00:58.170> righty

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
we get him on target here 25 all righty

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.940 
we get him on target here 25 all righty
here<00:00:58.800> she<00:00:58.859> goes<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.309> 25<00:00:59.699> yards

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.200

let's<00:01:23.109> write<00:01:23.319> with<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.500> left<00:01:23.709> I<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.319> see

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
let's write with the left I want to see

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.559 
let's write with the left I want to see
if<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.679> can<00:01:26.829> get<00:01:26.979> some<00:01:27.130> buckshot<00:01:27.849> on<00:01:28.209> this<00:01:28.359> thing

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
if I can get some buckshot on this thing

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.589 
if I can get some buckshot on this thing
with<00:01:28.780> both<00:01:28.990> barrels<00:01:29.459> I<00:01:30.459> know<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.359> about

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
with both barrels I know it can do about

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.510 
with both barrels I know it can do about
a<00:01:31.659> hand<00:01:32.109> size<00:01:32.319> pattern<00:01:32.770> with<00:01:33.069> low<00:01:33.280> recoil

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
a hand size pattern with low recoil

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.389 
a hand size pattern with low recoil
stuff<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.689> this<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.560> recoil<00:01:35.859> federal

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
stuff so this is for recoil federal

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.899 
stuff so this is for recoil federal
we're<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.179> to<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.569> patterns<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.140> well

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
we're going to see that patterns as well

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.429 
we're going to see that patterns as well
here's<00:01:40.950> left<00:01:41.950> barrel<00:01:42.429> or<00:01:42.579> right<00:01:42.789> barrel<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
here's left barrel or right barrel that

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
hit here's left packet too well let's

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.589 
hit here's left packet too well let's
