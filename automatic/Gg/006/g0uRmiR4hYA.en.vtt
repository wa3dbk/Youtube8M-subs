00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
we're gonna look at an app what's that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.760 
we're gonna look at an app what's that
called<00:00:13.370> in<00:00:14.370> his<00:00:15.179> little<00:00:15.809> digits<00:00:16.230> little

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
called in his little digits little

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.609 
called in his little digits little
digits<00:00:17.130> okay<00:00:17.460> let's<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.619> we

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
digits okay let's have a look at this we

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
digits okay let's have a look at this we
were<00:00:19.770> interested<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> different

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
were interested in the different

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.849 
were interested in the different
techniques<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.590> how<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.369> worked<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.859> now

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
techniques of how that worked so now

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.179 
techniques of how that worked so now

into<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.650> general<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:33.469> multi-touch

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
into to general and then multi-touch

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.910 
into to general and then multi-touch
touched<00:00:35.329> multitasking<00:00:36.329> gestures<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:37.710> turn
