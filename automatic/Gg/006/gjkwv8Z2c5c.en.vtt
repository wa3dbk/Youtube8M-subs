millimeters like they're like the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.710 
millimeters like they're like the
previous<00:01:45.650> models<00:01:46.180> what<00:01:47.180> else<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.510> got

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
their warrant well they've changed the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.850

end<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.640> one<00:01:49.790> with<00:01:50.030> from<00:01:50.330> 20<00:01:50.690> medals<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.290> 22

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
end of one with from 20 medals to 22

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.640 
end of one with from 20 medals to 22
mils<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.400> think<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.270> gives<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.350> bit<00:01:54.500> better

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
mils I think that gives a bit better

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.560 
mils I think that gives a bit better
presence<00:01:55.220> with<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:57.010> case<00:01:58.010> sighs<00:01:58.310> yeah<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.240> dial

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
presence with a case sighs yeah the dial

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.840 
presence with a case sighs yeah the dial
I<00:02:00.020> believe<00:02:00.650> has<00:02:00.860> taken<00:02:01.190> away<00:02:01.280> some<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I believe has taken away some of the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.410 
I believe has taken away some of the
detail<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.140> little<00:02:03.470> bit<00:02:03.740> flatter<00:02:04.700> yes

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
detail and it's a little bit flatter yes

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.810 
detail and it's a little bit flatter yes
there<00:02:05.720> really<00:02:05.750> are<00:02:06.110> no<00:02:06.320> differences<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.340> level

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
there really are no differences in level

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.600 
there really are no differences in level
to<00:02:08.149> give<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.420> any<00:02:08.869> great<00:02:09.250> visual<00:02:10.250> appeal

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
to give it any great visual appeal

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.420 
to give it any great visual appeal
although<00:02:11.769> particular<00:02:12.769> with<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> black<00:02:13.129> dial

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
although particular with the black dial

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.149 
although particular with the black dial
it<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.879> very<00:02:14.239> nice<00:02:14.420> inking<00:02:15.019> black<00:02:15.409> and<00:02:15.800> sort

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
it is a very nice inking black and sort

year I really liked it at Basel will is
the<00:03:11.140> BC<00:03:11.560> three<00:03:11.950> advanced<00:03:12.880> they've<00:03:13.329> taken<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
the BC three advanced they've taken that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.350 
the BC three advanced they've taken that
same<00:03:13.959> dlc<00:03:14.620> coating<00:03:14.860> which<00:03:15.190> they<00:03:15.370> use<00:03:15.670> on<00:03:16.000> the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
same dlc coating which they use on the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.210

BC<00:03:16.840> full<00:03:17.230> chronograph<00:03:18.720> DLC<00:03:19.860> super<00:03:20.860> resilient

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
BC full chronograph DLC super resilient

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.630 
BC full chronograph DLC super resilient
and<00:03:21.790> very<00:03:22.150> robust<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.680> think<00:03:24.129> it<00:03:24.220> adds<00:03:24.370> a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and very robust and I think it adds a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.600 
and very robust and I think it adds a
definite<00:03:25.269> level<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> BC<00:03:26.890> 3<00:03:27.129> it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
definite level to that to the BC 3 it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.729 
definite level to that to the BC 3 it
does<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:28.120> does<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.690> change<00:03:29.230> more<00:03:29.440> than<00:03:29.590> just

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
does it does and change more than just

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.009 
does it does and change more than just
the<00:03:29.860> color<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.250> course<00:03:30.519> they've<00:03:30.910> added<00:03:31.840> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
the color of course they've added a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.619 
the color of course they've added a
crown<00:03:32.650> protected<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.299> gives<00:03:34.329> the

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
crown protected to it so it gives the

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.020 
crown protected to it so it gives the
case<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.890> know<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> bit<00:03:36.310> more<00:03:36.340> presence<00:03:36.879> in

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and perhaps controversial they've made

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.020 
and perhaps controversial they've made
the<00:04:13.090> whole<00:04:13.299> dial<00:04:13.859> luminous<00:04:14.859> in<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.579> they

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
the whole dial luminous in it and they

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.110 
the whole dial luminous in it and they

thoughts shy I think you've got to see
it<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.419> flesh<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.770> photos<00:04:27.250> don't<00:04:28.169> perhaps

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
it in the flesh the photos don't perhaps

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.110 
it in the flesh the photos don't perhaps
time<00:04:29.349> to<00:04:29.500> adjust<00:04:29.800> it's<00:04:30.070> perhaps<00:04:30.340> not<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:31.000> know

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
time to adjust it's perhaps not you know

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.540 
time to adjust it's perhaps not you know
how<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.990> going<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.590> be<00:04:32.770> functioning<00:04:33.370> in

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
how is that going to be functioning in

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.520 
how is that going to be functioning in
say<00:04:33.880> 10<00:04:34.120> years<00:04:34.330> time<00:04:34.570> yeah<00:04:34.930> for<00:04:35.169> sure

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
say 10 years time yeah for sure

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.400 
say 10 years time yeah for sure
