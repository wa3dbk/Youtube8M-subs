00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
clay down this year so excited to see
next<00:01:17.009> season<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> bring

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
next season what that's going to bring

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
next season what that's going to bring
and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> racing<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and you know how the racing is going to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
and you know how the racing is going to
be<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> driver<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
be with that so I think the driver is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
be with that so I think the driver is
going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> lot<00:01:23.400> less<00:01:23.640> silk

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
going to like it has a lot less silk

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
going to like it has a lot less silk
content<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
content in it so I think it's going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
content in it so I think it's going to
be<00:01:25.830> better<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> fans<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> drivers

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
be better for the fans and the drivers

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
be better for the fans and the drivers

pieces<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.709> parts<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.040> he<00:03:23.129> has<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> team<00:03:23.729> of

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:23.759 
pieces and parts and he has a team of

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.030 
pieces and parts and he has a team of
engineers<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:25.049> word<00:03:25.199> were<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.439> vehicle<00:03:25.859> team

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
engineers the word were the vehicle team

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.129 
engineers the word were the vehicle team
to<00:03:26.250> create<00:03:26.579> these<00:03:26.759> amazing<00:03:27.139> high-performance

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
to create these amazing high-performance

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.469 
to create these amazing high-performance
variants<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> camaro<00:03:29.009> z/28<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.209> camaro

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
variants of the camaro z/28 the camaro

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.349 
variants of the camaro z/28 the camaro
zl1<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:31.169> camaro<00:03:31.439> SS<00:03:31.560> 1le<00:03:31.949> and<00:03:32.819> basically<00:03:33.180> what

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
zl1 the camaro SS 1le and basically what

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.199 
zl1 the camaro SS 1le and basically what
do<00:03:33.479> what<00:03:33.720> they<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.259> is<00:03:34.439> they<00:03:34.590> take<00:03:34.829> those

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
do what they do then is they take those

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.189 
do what they do then is they take those
parts<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.299> we've<00:03:36.389> designed<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:37.109> engineered

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
parts that we've designed and engineered

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.530 
parts that we've designed and engineered
and<00:03:37.590> tested<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.099> validated<00:03:38.159> we<00:03:39.150> pull<00:03:39.419> them

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
and tested and validated we pull them

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.089 
and tested and validated we pull them
down<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.750> make<00:03:40.169> them<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.650> they<00:03:40.829> fit

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
down and make them so that they fit

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.699 
down and make them so that they fit
properly<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> regular<00:03:42.449> camaro<00:03:42.870> SS<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.590> so

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
properly on a regular camaro SS and so

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.770 
properly on a regular camaro SS and so
you<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.919> basically<00:03:44.099> do<00:03:45.060> brake<00:03:45.299> system

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
you can basically do brake system

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170 
you can basically do brake system
suspensions<00:03:46.590> cooling<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.669> list<00:03:47.849> goes<00:03:48.000> on

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
suspensions cooling the list goes on

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.759 
suspensions cooling the list goes on
arrow<00:03:48.509> that<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.019> goes<00:03:49.169> on<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.680> on

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
arrow that this goes on and on and on

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.219 
arrow that this goes on and on and on
and<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.699> basically<00:03:51.209> bring<00:03:51.540> their<00:03:51.689> expertise

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
and they basically bring their expertise

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.199 
and they basically bring their expertise
to<00:03:52.979> the<00:03:53.009> high-performance<00:03:53.430> variant<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.939> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
to the high-performance variant and the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.759 
to the high-performance variant and the
parts<00:03:54.629> and<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:54.840> how<00:03:54.959> they<00:03:55.109> fit<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.590> then<00:03:55.680> we

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
parts and then how they fit and then we

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.890 
parts and then how they fit and then we
validate<00:03:56.219> against<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:57.180> know<00:03:57.269> regular<00:03:57.509> camaro

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
validate against you know regular camaro

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.449 
validate against you know regular camaro
SS<00:03:58.019> using<00:03:58.530> these<00:03:58.620> high-performance<00:03:58.859> parts

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
SS using these high-performance parts

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.640 
SS using these high-performance parts
and<00:03:59.790> as<00:04:00.659> a<00:04:00.750> result<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.139> can<00:04:01.349> if<00:04:01.530> they're

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and as a result we can if they're

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.780 
and as a result we can if they're
installed<00:04:01.919> by<00:04:02.040> dealer<00:04:02.219> well<00:04:02.370> back<00:04:02.549> with<00:04:02.759> a
