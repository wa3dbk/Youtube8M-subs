you'll<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.340> slow<00:02:12.610> us<00:02:12.640> down<00:02:12.790> with<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.300> leg

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you'll just slow us down with that leg

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.130 
you'll just slow us down with that leg
of<00:02:13.690> yours<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.820> war<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.570> here<00:02:16.989> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
of yours there's a war going on here I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.060
