00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:19.949
 I think that we should not handle 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.609
 I think a draw is already in bad 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:30.080
 condition is but at the same time 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:32.149
 can I say that the wings in 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 principle in a difficult situation 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 play stopped continued 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:47.910
 play quite aggressively basis 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.460
 character 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 felt special here and after the bar 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.930
 singing is celebrated more than but I think 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.570
 what 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:08.210
 you're right when talking about mistakes 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:10.400
 miscalculations and what is the result then the team 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.610
 ran off played it out for me 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:23.300
 it seems not only our merit but also 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:27.190
 merit knives which players have 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.190
 but no command today 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.030
 more interesting and the second point is that all the same 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 scrolling a new feeling less your own 1 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.470
 score 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.250
 boy but is he really playing 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.270
 through the disease because if you remember 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 last year 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.770
 then he last year already form and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:07.670
 platform and which usually scored 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 quite a lot but that was usually 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.900
 very dangerous due to the fact that well 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.209
 I took the ball well, played it back 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 partner 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.450
 here is a blow she has a good blow preserved 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.450
 him 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.910
 receiving the ball he is now somewhat 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.599
 He looks forward became bound 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:44.079
 cling to the ball and became somewhat worse 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:47.120
 due to the fact that he recently 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.049
 here putting yourself in order after injury 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.990
 lost somewhere a kilo of six or seven 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:59.440
 it will not just reset such 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.459
 weight is also 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.459
 it means to stand upright
