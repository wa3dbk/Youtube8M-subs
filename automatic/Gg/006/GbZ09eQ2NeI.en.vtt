00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
don't like the ends so if you keep down

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.570 
don't like the ends so if you keep down
to<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.570> little<00:00:40.750> secret<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:41.890> here<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.100> go<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.460> have

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
to a little secret so here we go we have

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.550 
to a little secret so here we go we have
our<00:00:42.700> food<00:00:42.880> here<00:00:43.150> I'm<00:00:43.780> going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.140> stick<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.470> the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
our food here I'm going to stick in the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.640 
our food here I'm going to stick in the
microwave<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:46.420> like<00:00:46.600> most<00:00:46.990> andre's<00:00:47.470> take

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
microwave it's like most andre's take

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.290 
microwave it's like most andre's take
about<00:00:47.920> six<00:00:48.250> minutes<00:00:48.490> so<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> little<00:00:48.940> bit<00:00:49.060> more

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
about six minutes so a little bit more

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.990 
about six minutes so a little bit more
so<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.630> little<00:00:49.810> bit<00:00:49.930> less<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.700> first<00:00:51.700> few

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
so a little bit less of first few

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.850 
so a little bit less of first few
minutes<00:00:52.240> and<00:00:52.510> then<00:00:52.990> we're<00:00:53.140> going<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.500> remove

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
minutes and then we're going to remove

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.920 
minutes and then we're going to remove
the<00:00:54.070> protein<00:00:54.430> two<00:00:55.150> more<00:00:55.360> minutes<00:00:55.570> add<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
the protein two more minutes add the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.840 
the protein two more minutes add the
protein<00:00:56.470> back<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.830> stirring<00:00:57.580> occasionally

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
protein back in stirring occasionally

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.229 
protein back in stirring occasionally
and<00:00:58.270> we'll<00:00:58.600> see<00:00:58.750> how<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.870> goes

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.359 

plus<00:01:05.239> our<00:01:05.659> sloppy<00:01:06.320> eggs<00:01:06.770> are<00:01:06.979> done<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:07.280> their

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
plus our sloppy eggs are done with their

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.850 
plus our sloppy eggs are done with their
first<00:01:07.520> cycle<00:01:07.900> will<00:01:08.900> take<00:01:09.110> them<00:01:09.290> out<00:01:09.440> I'm<00:01:09.680> going

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
first cycle will take them out I'm going

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.910 
first cycle will take them out I'm going
to<00:01:09.979> remove<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.460> protein<00:01:10.880> first<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.740> can<00:01:12.740> set

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
to remove the protein first I can set

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.980 
to remove the protein first I can set
them<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.250> lid<00:01:13.430> kind<00:01:13.940> of<00:01:14.030> keeps<00:01:14.180> my<00:01:14.330> area

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
them on the lid kind of keeps my area

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.710 
them on the lid kind of keeps my area
nice<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.500> even<00:01:15.920> clean<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.479> protein<00:01:17.479> keeps

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
nice and even clean the protein keeps

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.780 
nice and even clean the protein keeps
the<00:01:17.930> quickest<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.619> carbohydrates<00:01:19.250> into<00:01:19.520> heat

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
the quickest the carbohydrates into heat

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.480 
the quickest the carbohydrates into heat
slowest<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:21.500> has<00:01:21.740> an<00:01:21.920> apples<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.460> onions

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
slowest this has an apples and onions

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.620 
slowest this has an apples and onions
two<00:01:22.820> small<00:01:23.090> pieces<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:24.700> carbohydrate<00:01:25.700> unlike

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
two small pieces of carbohydrate unlike

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.810 
two small pieces of carbohydrate unlike
the<00:01:26.840> sweet<00:01:27.049> potato<00:01:27.350> peeler<00:01:27.890> kids<00:01:28.250> which<00:01:28.549> kind

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
the sweet potato peeler kids which kind

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.029 
the sweet potato peeler kids which kind
of<00:01:28.850> they<00:01:29.330> get<00:01:29.479> rolled<00:01:29.659> into<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.049> container<00:01:30.380> so

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
of they get rolled into the container so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.289 
of they get rolled into the container so
it's<00:01:31.220> not<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.520> important<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.000> stir<00:01:32.180> these

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
it's not so important to stir these

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.270 
it's not so important to stir these
right<00:01:32.539> away<00:01:32.570> but<00:01:33.289> we'll<00:01:33.440> still<00:01:33.530> still<00:01:34.009> do<00:01:34.130> that

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
right away but we'll still still do that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.560 
right away but we'll still still do that
we're<00:01:34.759> going<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.909> go<00:01:35.030> ahead<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.210> sing<00:01:35.390> them<00:01:35.479> in

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
we're going to go ahead and sing them in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.570 
we're going to go ahead and sing them in
for<00:01:35.720> another<00:01:35.840> two<00:01:41.229> awesome<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.800> our<00:01:43.069> second

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
for another two awesome so our second

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.430 
for another two awesome so our second
cycle<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:44.000> heating<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.360> done<00:01:44.569> I<00:01:44.810> always<00:01:45.229> like

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
cycle of heating is done I always like

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.559 
cycle of heating is done I always like
to<00:01:45.470> check<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.920> nice<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.119> buttons<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
to check in nice the buttons to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.450 
to check in nice the buttons to
lecoultre<00:01:48.380> know<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.920> probably<00:01:49.340> put

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
lecoultre know that we can probably put

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.859 
lecoultre know that we can probably put
them<00:01:49.550> in<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.819> little<00:01:49.880> bit<00:01:50.030> longer<00:01:50.149> now

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
them in for a little bit longer now

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.130 
them in for a little bit longer now
we'll<00:01:51.080> put<00:01:51.229> my<00:01:51.350> proteins<00:01:51.770> back<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:53.140> another

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
we'll put my proteins back in another

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.139 
we'll put my proteins back in another
two<00:01:54.440> minutes<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.979> will<00:01:55.460> check<00:01:55.700> minute<00:01:55.970> one

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
two minutes I will check minute one

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.230 
two minutes I will check minute one
minute<00:01:56.179> just<00:01:56.690> make<00:01:56.869> sure<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.289> they're<00:01:57.500> okay

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
minute just make sure that they're okay

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.389 
minute just make sure that they're okay
sometimes<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.390> some<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.800> denser<00:02:00.800> proteins

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
sometimes on some of the denser proteins

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.430 
sometimes on some of the denser proteins
it<00:02:01.670> helps<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.240> little<00:02:02.420> bit<00:02:02.600> especially<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
it helps a little bit especially the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
it helps a little bit especially the
couplets<00:02:03.799> if<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.399> kind<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.640> cut<00:02:04.880> them<00:02:05.060> that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
couplets if you kind of cut them that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.290 
couplets if you kind of cut them that
way<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.080> middle<00:02:06.679> gets<00:02:06.890> cooked<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.459> outside

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
way the middle gets cooked and outside

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.270 
way the middle gets cooked and outside
stow<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.619> probably<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.160> biggest

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
stow that is probably one of the biggest

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.880 
stow that is probably one of the biggest
secrets<00:02:10.840> all<00:02:11.840> right<00:02:12.080> we'll<00:02:12.379> go<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.680> one

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
secrets all right we'll go for one

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.860 
secrets all right we'll go for one
minute<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.310> see<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:13.940> need<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.270> rock<00:02:14.480> for<00:02:14.660> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.220 

all<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.140> third<00:02:18.680> cycle<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.370> complete<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
