00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.370
 so 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.720
 not so much more my tooth hurts a lot 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.140
 first we need to realize we see you 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.140
 opens your mouth very big 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.450
 santi you have a tooth that is already 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.210
 sick that happened to her because she got sick 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.140
 see santi how many times a day do you wash your 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.940
 shops since there is almost no next 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 tell me santi what do you like the most 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:56.440
 I like eating with the sweet cakes and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.489
 a glass of milk before I fall asleep 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.860
 probably because many meals 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 sweet and did not wash his teeth after 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.229
 of eating and especially before sleeping 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.360
 that food was left forgotten in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.430
 a corner of your tooth 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.659
 look up is lunch of the week 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 pass 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.210
 the pain is because he already lost the layer that 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.130
 covered it and that makes you stronger 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.290
 you remember what his name was 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.070
 enamel 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 very well 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.320
 that layer protects the tooth of all 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.690
 bugs or microorganisms that we have in 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.060
 the mouth and that in the presence of these 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.240
 remains of food produce substances 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.850
 that eat and sting that hard layer of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.660
 tooth and goes to the second layer or 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.830
 dentin or can reach the pulp 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.610
 and it comes with that signal to the pulp 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.600
 let's take a picture of your tooth 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.840
 if santi already arrived with dona pulpa if 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 you are in the treatment that requires 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.150
 flame octopus take this is done in 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.550
 the temporary teeth when you have 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.530
 that eliminate a part of the pulp the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.320
 that is in the crown because the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.020
 microorganisms have already reached it and the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.570
 dirty aaron then you have to place a 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.300
 medication to cover it and for 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.090
 last seal it so it does not come back to 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.120
 put another bug to the grindstone and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.700
 had reached the roots and in my 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.019
 hand I would have done 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.310
 well in that case it would have to be removed 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.310
 definitely to the pulp of your home 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.280
 both the crown and the root of 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.860
 tooth and fill the space that he left 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.840
 empty with another medicine that helps you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.120
 to keep the tooth until it comes out 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.540
 permanent and as with the pulp 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.690
 Take it to seal it so nobody gets in 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.069
 your wheel is already full of holes 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.680
 you would need a new crown so that 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.319
 you could chew watching your high more 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.319
 Well to remove suspicion of my tooth
