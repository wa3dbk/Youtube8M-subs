00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome to the eighth class of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 guitar guitar peace and point is in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 this class we will learn to harmonize two 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.039
 guitar lines well for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 start we'll take a simple melody 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.869
 to make him in this case we will make a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.570
 third to start then we're going to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 catch the n laterality of C major 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.810
 and it will be simply two reis me 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.070
 the three notes that this voice will have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.090
 tonic 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.220
 then the third voice would be the third 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.739
 notes of these notes that we just 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.930
 say of the pain and that in the case of two 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.930
 because the third of two would be a thousand 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.520
 in the case of networks he was a fan and in 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.520
 the case of me would be a sun 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 ah 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 all right 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.189
 well then this city about the tonic and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.470
 the third one now we see the tonic and the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.470
 fifth the tonic as a novelist before 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.979
 with the fifths of these notes would be 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.580
 I understand it would be just subtract and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.580
 misery yes 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.899
 s 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.899
 Well now we see the example of the fact 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 do not 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.369
 up to this source 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100
 m 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 m 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.970
 m 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.760
 the trick to harmonize a line of 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.829
 guitar only consists of doing the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 third with the fifth of the note that 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.609
 we want to harmonize if we are in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.370
 tonalities do major and we want 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.650
 harmonize two the third would be me and the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.959
 fifth would be sun but if we were in 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.930
 finger minor finger the third no longer 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.579
 it would be me and I would have started holding and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.709
 it would only be maintained because the fifths did not 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.989
 change whether the record is greater 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.849
 consumer or change and now I will put a 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.730
 example of this resource applying super 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.040
 vocation the song is the trooper of the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.870
 iron band maiden and here what is 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.150
 doing is a harmonization with a 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.970
 third is to say the main guitar 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.210
 would give on the tonic note of the melody and 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.530
 the second guitar would do the third voice 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.530
 so nothing inside video 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.400
 i 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.450
 and up to here the eighth guitar class 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.050
 of the point drama is this resource and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.050
 nothing else
