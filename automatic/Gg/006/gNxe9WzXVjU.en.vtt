00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
inverse piercing and this is how it

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.450 
inverse piercing and this is how it
looks<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:39.559> don't<00:00:40.559> pay<00:00:40.680> any<00:00:40.860> mind<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> top

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
looks and don't pay any mind to the top

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.119 
looks and don't pay any mind to the top
one<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.750> inverse<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.800> heard<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
one but the inverse actually heard a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
one but the inverse actually heard a
little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.730> i<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.420> high<00:00:45.719> pain

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
little bit and i have a really high pain

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.770 
little bit and i have a really high pain
tolerance<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
tolerance so and the only thing is that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
tolerance so and the only thing is that
because<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> inverse<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> lower<00:00:50.250> belly<00:00:50.520> one

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because the inverse the lower belly one

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.479 
because the inverse the lower belly one
has<00:00:50.969> thicker<00:00:51.420> skin<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> top<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.649> does<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
has thicker skin and the top one does so

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
has thicker skin and the top one does so
i<00:00:53.520> felt<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.210> pinch<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.809> didn't<00:00:55.079> hurt

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
i felt a little pinch but it didn't hurt

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.229 
i felt a little pinch but it didn't hurt
that<00:00:55.260> much<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.730> give<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that much so i will give it like on a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.369 
that much so i will give it like on a
scale<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.570> 23<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.090> um<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:00.989> healing

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
scale of 23 and um it's really healing

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
scale of 23 and um it's really healing
well<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.370> i'll<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:02.670> video<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
