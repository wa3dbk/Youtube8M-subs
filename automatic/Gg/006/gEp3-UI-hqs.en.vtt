00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 how I converted kilograms force over 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.120
 cubic meter to pounds on the foot 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.090
 cubic we say that one kilogram force 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 is equivalent to 2.20 pounds a pound 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.470
 is equivalent to 0.4 53 kilograms 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 force one cubic meter is equivalent to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.029
 3.28 foot our examples are the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.640
 following with other exercises 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 convert 1500 kilograms was about 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.420
 cubic meter to one pound on foot 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.630
 cubic and 1,800 kilograms forces on 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.530
 cubic meter to pounds on cubic foot 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.250
 now let's see the exercises the first 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.940
 exercise does not say 1500 kilograms force 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.810
 about cubic meter to pounds on the foot 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.010
 cubic 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:01.430
 then I have one thousand 500 kilograms force 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 about cubic meter to eliminate the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.100
 kilogram force multiplied it by one 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.030
 for a pound and its equivalent to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.030
 kilograms force 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.579
 0.45 3 kilograms force 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.950
 how this operation is dividing or 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.119
 be multiplying and then dividing 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 goes to kilograms force 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.380
 and then I multiply one more time for 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.420
 eliminate the cubic meter then just 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.170
 multiplied by one cubic meter and its 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.390
 equivalent 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.610
 its equivalent forgiveness in feet 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.710
 and then the third power to make it 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.100
 one cubic meter 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.650
 as here once again he is dividing 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.980
 goes to metro by metro meter with metro and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.560
 I would stay 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.159
 pound over about cubic foot 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 but 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:07.370
 the 3.28 raised to the third power and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:12.700
 the result would be 35.28 75 cubic feet 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:21.230
 Now what follows would be 1500 times 1 / 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 0.45 3 for 1 / 35.28 75 and the result 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.870
 end would be 90 and 3.83 pounds on foot 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 cubic our second exercise we 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.260
 He says 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.970
 1,800 kilograms force over a meter 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.830
 Cubic to eliminate kilograms force 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.930
 multiplied by one pound and its 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.090
 equivalent in kilograms force that 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.650
 it would be 0.45 3 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 and how are you dividing 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.739
 it is eliminated that we achieve strength I do what 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.780
 same to eliminate the cubic meter 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.280
 multiplied by one cubic meter and its 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.760
 equivalent standing and elevated it to the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.550
 third power this would be a meter 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.000
 cubic already 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.040
 and here it comes out would be removed then 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.490
 how is this tied to the third 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.030
 I'm looking for my result that would be 35 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.520
 28 75 32 5.28 75 cubic feet 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.410
 then my last step would be 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:37.420
 multiply 1800 by one between 0.45 three 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:40.660
 and then for one again between 35.28 75 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.350
 as a result we would have 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.950
 112 points 60 book on foot 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.470
 so it becomes 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.170
 from kilograms force on the meter 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.170
 cubic to pounds on the cubic foot
