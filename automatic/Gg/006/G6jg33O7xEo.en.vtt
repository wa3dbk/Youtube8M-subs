let's keep it away from it slides in and
get<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> bottom<00:01:04.290> half<00:01:04.580> that'd<00:01:06.439> be<00:01:07.439> nice<00:01:07.590> with

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.420 
the air cutouts for the buttons there
and<00:01:12.420> bottom<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:14.369> designs<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
and bottom of this designs basically so

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.300 
and bottom of this designs basically so
exactly<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> dock<00:01:18.409> like<00:01:19.409> say<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.979> not

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
exactly how the dock like say that's not

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.580

for<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.549> spoon<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.830> idea<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
for this spoon but the idea is you can

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.870 
for this spoon but the idea is you can
take<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> bottom<00:01:26.009> off<00:01:26.130> stock<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
take the bottom off stock it in and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
take the bottom off stock it in and
whether<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.329> my<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> don't

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
whether it's just my one or what I don't
know<00:01:31.619> when<00:01:31.860> I'll<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.159> take<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> bottom

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
know when I'll try and take the bottom

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.319 
know when I'll try and take the bottom
off<00:01:33.229> top<00:01:34.229> wants<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> come<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.829> instead<00:01:35.329> but
