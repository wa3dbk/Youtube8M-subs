00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
assuming a lot of people you slide a

assuming a lot of people you slide a
hand<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.799> seemed<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

hand it seemed like in the
million-dollar<00:01:47.939> tournament<00:01:48.509> most<00:01:48.689> people

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
million-dollar tournament most people

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that a lot of people will probably use

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
sure how that will work because it says

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
sure how that will work because it says
that<00:02:06.210> people<00:02:06.360> show<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> radar<00:02:07.140> with

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.580 
have them together I am super excited I
think<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.180> will<00:02:49.240> balance<00:02:49.480> out<00:02:49.840> quick<00:02:50.350> draw

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
think that will balance out quick draw

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.680 
think that will balance out quick draw
you<00:02:50.890> know<00:02:51.010> having<00:02:51.400> quick-draw<00:02:51.790> blast<00:02:52.330> shields

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
you know having quick-draw blast shields

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.360 
you know having quick-draw blast shields
and<00:02:52.870> assassin<00:02:53.380> pro<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.710> same<00:02:53.950> tier<00:02:54.220> will

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
and assassin pro in the same tier will

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550 
and assassin pro in the same tier will
actually<00:02:54.790> balance<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.270> out<00:02:55.390> because<00:02:55.960> assassin

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
actually balance it out because assassin

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.170 
actually balance it out because assassin
is<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.980> second<00:02:57.400> half<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.700> ghost<00:02:57.940> after

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
is like the second half a ghost after

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.330 
is like the second half a ghost after
they<00:02:58.420> split<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.810> up<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.110> kind<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.380> protects<00:03:00.190> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
they split it up it kind of protects you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.690 
they split it up it kind of protects you
from<00:03:00.400> UAVs<00:03:01.060> counter<00:03:01.450> UAVs<00:03:01.900> EMPs<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.980> mean<00:03:03.520> it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
from UAVs counter UAVs EMPs I mean it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.430 
from UAVs counter UAVs EMPs I mean it
does<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> lot<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.630> usually<00:03:04.840> where<00:03:05.200> cod

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
does a lot this is usually where cod

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.560 
does a lot this is usually where cod
games<00:03:05.740> get<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.040> trouble<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:07.060> where<00:03:07.360> they've

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
games get in trouble it's where they've

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.450 
games get in trouble it's where they've
historically<00:03:07.750> kept<00:03:08.470> stopping<00:03:08.770> power<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.190> kind

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
historically kept stopping power to kind

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.850 
historically kept stopping power to kind
of<00:03:09.520> keep<00:03:09.700> people<00:03:10.120> from<00:03:10.270> using<00:03:10.510> ghost<00:03:11.050> without

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
of keep people from using ghost without

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
of keep people from using ghost without
having<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.250> give<00:03:12.400> up<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.640> big<00:03:12.850> advantage<00:03:13.180> but<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
having to give up a big advantage but I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.040 
having to give up a big advantage but I
think<00:03:14.200> by<00:03:15.090> by<00:03:16.090> putting<00:03:16.360> blast<00:03:16.630> shield<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
think by by putting blast shield and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.390 
think by by putting blast shield and
clicked<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.440> there<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.710> actually<00:03:17.950> do<00:03:18.100> give<00:03:18.280> up

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
clicked on there you actually do give up

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.490 
clicked on there you actually do give up
a<00:03:18.550> substantial<00:03:18.760> amount<00:03:19.240> in<00:03:19.690> order<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.320> use

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
a substantial amount in order to use

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.290 
a substantial amount in order to use
this<00:03:20.710> perk<00:03:20.950> which<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.220> think<00:03:21.400> will<00:03:21.520> well<00:03:22.000> should

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
this perk which I think will well should

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.780 
this perk which I think will well should
help<00:03:22.710> who<00:03:23.710> knows<00:03:23.890> we'll<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.430> how<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.610> plays

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
help who knows we'll see how it plays

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.700 
help who knows we'll see how it plays
out<00:03:25.180> when<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> game<00:03:25.630> actually<00:03:25.810> comes<00:03:26.230> out<00:03:26.380> but

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
out when the game actually comes out but

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.860 
out when the game actually comes out but
I<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.550> SAS<00:03:27.760> approach<00:03:28.090> still<00:03:28.360> does<00:03:28.630> too

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I think a SAS approach still does too

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870 
I think a SAS approach still does too
much<00:03:29.110> but<00:03:29.560> we'll<00:03:29.830> see<00:03:30.010> how<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.160> plays<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.610> and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
much but we'll see how it plays out and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.610 
much but we'll see how it plays out and
then<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.480> third<00:03:31.660> tier<00:03:31.930> has<00:03:32.050> historically

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
then the third tier has historically

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.290 
then the third tier has historically
been<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.860> weakest<00:03:33.490> here<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.850> my<00:03:34.000> opinion

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
been the weakest here in my opinion

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.560 
been the weakest here in my opinion
because<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.650> cod<00:03:36.190> 4<00:03:36.490> modern<00:03:36.820> warfare<00:03:36.910> 2<00:03:37.360> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
because in a cod 4 modern warfare 2 and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.750 
because in a cod 4 modern warfare 2 and
black<00:03:38.020> ops<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.590> saw<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.980> perks<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.670> you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
black ops you saw the perks that you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.130 
black ops you saw the perks that you
were<00:03:39.820> usually<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.210> was<00:03:40.300> usually<00:03:40.570> dominated<00:03:41.050> by

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
were usually it was usually dominated by

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.070 
were usually it was usually dominated by
like<00:03:41.320> sitrep<00:03:41.860> or<00:03:42.160> ninja<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.910> think<00:03:43.510> cod4<00:03:43.900> was

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
like sitrep or ninja I think cod4 was

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.810 
like sitrep or ninja I think cod4 was
definitely<00:03:44.470> debt<00:03:44.650> dominated<00:03:45.340> by<00:03:45.490> dead

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
definitely debt dominated by dead

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.010 
definitely debt dominated by dead
silence<00:03:46.300> I<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.620> maybe<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:49.660> know<00:03:49.690> I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
silence I think that maybe you know I

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.480 
silence I think that maybe you know I
would<00:03:50.230> like<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.380> say<00:03:50.530> modern<00:03:50.800> warfare<00:03:50.950> 2<00:03:51.250> was

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
would like to say modern warfare 2 was

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.540 
would like to say modern warfare 2 was
either<00:03:51.640> sitrep<00:03:52.240> or<00:03:52.450> ninja<00:03:53.050> mostly<00:03:53.560> ninja<00:03:53.980> some

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
either sitrep or ninja mostly ninja some

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.490 
either sitrep or ninja mostly ninja some
people<00:03:54.820> did<00:03:55.030> run<00:03:55.210> steady<00:03:55.450> aim<00:03:55.660> but<00:03:55.960> it<00:03:56.170> wasn't

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
people did run steady aim but it wasn't

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.590 
people did run steady aim but it wasn't
really<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.400> sound<00:03:57.640> was<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:57.970> good<00:03:58.210> miss<00:03:58.390> game

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
really the sound was so good miss game

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.180 
really the sound was so good miss game
that<00:03:58.780> he<00:03:58.840> really<00:03:59.230> gave<00:03:59.470> up<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.710> lot<00:03:59.920> by<00:04:00.160> not

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
that he really gave up a lot by not

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.270 
that he really gave up a lot by not
using<00:04:00.370> ninja<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.210> I<00:04:02.110> personally<00:04:02.590> felt<00:04:03.040> like

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
using ninja so I personally felt like

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.070 
using ninja so I personally felt like
ninja<00:04:03.700> dominated<00:04:04.240> this<00:04:04.360> tier<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:04.810> hasn't

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
ninja dominated this tier there hasn't

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.480 
ninja dominated this tier there hasn't
really<00:04:05.140> been<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.410> whole<00:04:05.620> lot<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.860> cool<00:04:06.070> perks<00:04:06.310> in

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
really been a whole lot of cool perks in

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.070 
really been a whole lot of cool perks in
this<00:04:06.640> here<00:04:06.850> but<00:04:07.060> now<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.240> see<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.690> addition

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
this here but now you see the addition

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.140 
this here but now you see the addition
of<00:04:08.230> stalker<00:04:08.740> pro<00:04:09.130> which<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.490> lot<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.910> people

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
of stalker pro which a lot of the people

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.040 
of stalker pro which a lot of the people
were<00:04:10.270> using<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.780> million-dollar

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
were using in the million-dollar

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.290 
were using in the million-dollar
tournament<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:12.250> actually<00:04:12.430> walk<00:04:12.850> faster

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
tournament you actually walk faster

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.570 
tournament you actually walk faster
while<00:04:13.480> aiming<00:04:13.720> down<00:04:13.930> sights<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:15.040> think

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
while aiming down sights and I think

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.340 
while aiming down sights and I think
that<00:04:15.670> that's<00:04:15.700> kind<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.420> cool<00:04:16.720> perk<00:04:17.080> I

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
that that's kind of a cool perk I

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.199 
that that's kind of a cool perk I
curious<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.220> see<00:04:18.340> how<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.640> plays<00:04:18.790> out<00:04:19.030> then

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
curious to see how that plays out then

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.800 
curious to see how that plays out then
you<00:04:19.299> got<00:04:19.450> steady<00:04:19.720> aim<00:04:19.900> sitrep

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
you got steady aim sitrep

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.600 
you got steady aim sitrep
you<00:04:21.810> obviously<00:04:22.200> have<00:04:22.380> dead<00:04:22.590> silence<00:04:23.040> it's<00:04:23.460> not

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
you obviously have dead silence it's not

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.150 
you obviously have dead silence it's not
the<00:04:23.790> same<00:04:23.970> as<00:04:24.120> ninja<00:04:24.480> anymore<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:25.160> they've

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
the same as ninja anymore but they've

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.720 
the same as ninja anymore but they've
actually<00:04:26.430> combined<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.180> sitrep<00:04:27.630> pro<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:29.130> think

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
actually combined the sitrep pro I think

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.850 
actually combined the sitrep pro I think
that<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.120> dead<00:04:30.510> silence<00:04:30.870> now<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.110> hear

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
that that dead silence now you hear

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.160 
that that dead silence now you hear
enemies<00:04:32.310> better<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.120> don't<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.870> me<00:04:33.990> wrong

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
enemies better I don't get me wrong

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.690 
enemies better I don't get me wrong
don't<00:04:34.530> quote<00:04:35.040> me<00:04:35.160> on<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.280> I'm<00:04:35.430> not<00:04:35.520> really

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
don't quote me on that I'm not really

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.190 
don't quote me on that I'm not really
sure<00:04:35.820> how<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.300> works<00:04:36.420> out<00:04:36.690> but<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.930> think<00:04:37.080> this

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
sure how that works out but I think this

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.780 
sure how that works out but I think this
is<00:04:37.320> going<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.530> be<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.680> weakest<00:04:38.040> hear<00:04:38.280> things

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
is going to be the weakest hear things

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.790 
is going to be the weakest hear things
going<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> be<00:04:39.120> dominated<00:04:39.480> by<00:04:39.660> dead<00:04:40.350> silence

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
going to be dominated by dead silence

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.470 
going to be dominated by dead silence
