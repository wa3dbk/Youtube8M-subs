in this video we're going to show you
how<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.929> network<00:00:03.929> load<00:00:04.350> balance<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:05.390> to<00:00:06.390> web

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
how to network load balance on to web

okay<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.630> first<00:00:10.019> we're<00:00:10.260> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> go<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
okay so first we're going to go to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
okay so first we're going to go to
features<00:00:13.940> in<00:00:14.940> our<00:00:15.059> server<00:00:15.330> manager<00:00:15.809> we're

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
features in our server manager we're

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.609 
features in our server manager we're
going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> add<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> feature<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:18.690> we're<00:00:19.500> going

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
going to add a feature and we're going

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.380 
going to add a feature and we're going
to<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.130> Network<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> load<00:00:20.910> balancing

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390

to look for Network a load balancing
which<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.660> right<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.460> we'll<00:00:23.460> click

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
which is right there and we'll click

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.770 
which is right there and we'll click
Next<00:00:24.619> go<00:00:25.619> ahead<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.890> install<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.090 

okay<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.900> while<00:00:35.020> that's<00:00:35.230> working<00:00:35.500> I'll<00:00:35.950> go

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
okay and while that's working I'll go

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.520 
okay and while that's working I'll go
ahead<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.400> do<00:00:36.490> it<00:00:36.610> on<00:00:36.670> my<00:00:36.910> other<00:00:37.150> server<00:00:37.510> so<00:00:38.320> go

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
ahead and do it on my other server so go

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.430 
ahead and do it on my other server so go
to<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.710> features<00:00:40.470> add<00:00:41.470> features<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:43.440> work

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
to the features add features and work

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.150

we're going to add a host web to and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.880 
we're going to add a host web to and
want<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.009> interface<00:01:24.690> next<00:01:25.690> it's<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.830> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
want that interface next it's going to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.660 
want that interface next it's going to
be<00:01:26.979> first<00:01:27.220> priority<00:01:28.440> next<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:30.430> then<00:01:30.580> we're
