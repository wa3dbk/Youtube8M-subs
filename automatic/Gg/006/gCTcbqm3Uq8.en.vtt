as a kid we had we had spud guns we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
as a kid we had we had spud guns we
played<00:00:39.930> around<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.290> them<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.370> sorts

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
played around with them with all sorts

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.319 
played around with them with all sorts
of<00:00:41.910> fuels<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:43.440> sorts<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.040> projectiles<00:00:44.760> just

about<00:00:45.510> anything<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.050> imagine<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.620> tried

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
about anything you can imagine we tried

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
about anything you can imagine we tried
shooting<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.379> saw<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.770> similar

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
shooting out of it but I saw a similar

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.150 
shooting out of it but I saw a similar
video<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:51.600> YouTube<00:00:53.000> someone<00:00:54.000> had<00:00:54.149> built<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
video on YouTube someone had built a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.240 
video on YouTube someone had built a
projectile<00:00:56.930> launcher<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.620> powered<00:00:59.219> by

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
projectile launcher that was powered by

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
projectile launcher that was powered by
a<00:00:59.399> gasifier<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> after<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.609> 12<00:01:03.539> minutes<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a gasifier and after like 12 minutes of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
a gasifier and after like 12 minutes of
video<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> climax<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
video you get right to the climax and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
video you get right to the climax and
then<00:01:06.150> nothing<00:01:06.450> happens<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.470> never<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then nothing happens you never see a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.670 
then nothing happens you never see a
chew<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> major<00:01:09.510> let<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
chew that was a major let them so I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640 
chew that was a major let them so I
thought<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.130> know<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:12.290> I'm<00:01:13.290> gonna<00:01:13.409> try<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
thought you know what I'm gonna try to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.640 
thought you know what I'm gonna try to
build<00:01:13.950> hello<00:01:14.760> spud<00:01:15.450> guns<00:01:15.720> even<00:01:16.049> powered<00:01:16.470> off

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
build hello spud guns even powered off

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
build hello spud guns even powered off
the<00:01:16.799> gasifier<00:01:18.530> I've<00:01:19.530> made<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> few<00:01:19.860> few<00:01:20.549> test

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
the gasifier I've made a few few test
shots<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.080> there's<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
shots with it as you can see there's a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
shots with it as you can see there's a
potato<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> cut<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> chunks<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> potato<00:01:24.450> into

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
potato I cut the chunks of potato into

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.870 
potato I cut the chunks of potato into
like<00:01:24.840> three<00:01:24.960> quarter<00:01:25.350> inch<00:01:25.500> wide<00:01:26.220> slaps<00:01:27.740> does

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
like three quarter inch wide slaps does

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.520 
like three quarter inch wide slaps does
using<00:01:29.270> for<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.719> projectile<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:33.289> most

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
using for a projectile the most

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.100 
using for a projectile the most
difficult<00:01:34.039> part<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:35.000> getting<00:01:35.659> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
difficult part of this is getting the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.420 
difficult part of this is getting the
wood<00:01:36.649> gas<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.310> air<00:01:37.579> ratio<00:01:38.259> right<00:01:39.259> how<00:01:40.250> much

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
wood gas to air ratio right how much

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.219 
wood gas to air ratio right how much
wood<00:01:40.759> gas<00:01:40.970> how<00:01:41.210> long<00:01:41.390> do<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:41.600> leave<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.049> in

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
wood gas how long do I leave this in

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.050 
wood gas how long do I leave this in
front<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:42.890> my<00:01:43.539> flare<00:01:44.539> bite<00:01:45.700> how<00:01:46.700> long<00:01:46.880> does<00:01:47.000> it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
front of my flare bite how long does it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.120 
front of my flare bite how long does it
stay<00:01:47.179> on<00:01:47.329> how<00:01:47.689> long<00:01:47.869> do<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.079> pull<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.829> off<00:01:48.920> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
stay on how long do I pull it off and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.370 
stay on how long do I pull it off and
cap<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.970> get<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.329> right<00:01:50.509> air<00:01:50.780> mixture<00:01:51.110> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
cap it to get the right air mixture to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.679 
cap it to get the right air mixture to
make<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.740> explosive<00:01:52.670> enough<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.179> launch<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
make it explosive enough to launch a

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.039 
make it explosive enough to launch a
projectile<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.700> that's<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> tricky<00:01:56.119> part<00:01:56.329> it

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
projectile and that's the tricky part it

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.929 
projectile and that's the tricky part it
may<00:01:57.319> work<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.710> very<00:01:57.890> first<00:01:58.159> try<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.700> may<00:01:58.909> take

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
may work the very first try it may take

me 30 so bear with me and let's give her
a<00:02:02.209> shot<00:02:02.420> gasifier<00:02:03.229> same<00:02:04.159> old<00:02:04.340> field<00:02:04.670> 1.6<00:02:05.330> it's

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
a shot gasifier same old field 1.6 it's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.289 
a shot gasifier same old field 1.6 it's
up<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.840> temp<00:02:06.080> firing<00:02:06.619> off<00:02:06.740> blue<00:02:07.340> gasps<00:02:07.610> looks

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
up to temp firing off blue gasps looks

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.779 
up to temp firing off blue gasps looks
pretty<00:02:08.569> let's<00:02:09.440> give<00:02:09.590> her<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> shot<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.459> kill

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
pretty let's give her a shot and kill

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.550 
pretty let's give her a shot and kill
the<00:02:10.910> gas<00:02:14.170> almost<00:02:15.170> out<00:02:16.120> open<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.299> up<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the gas almost out open it back up so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.170 
the gas almost out open it back up so
now<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.769> just<00:02:18.799> have<00:02:19.180> wood<00:02:20.180> gas<00:02:20.420> that's<00:02:20.750> unlit

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
now we just have wood gas that's unlit

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.550 
now we just have wood gas that's unlit
will<00:02:23.180> take<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> potato

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.380 

shove<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> down<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.010> their<00:02:29.220> cuts<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> nice

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
shove it down on their cuts out a nice

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.950 
shove it down on their cuts out a nice
little<00:02:30.600> neat<00:02:30.810> circle<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.660> use<00:02:33.810> this

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
little neat circle and I just use this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.660 
little neat circle and I just use this
little<00:02:34.140> extendable<00:02:34.860> magnet<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.460> ramrod

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
little extendable magnet for a ramrod

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.250 
little extendable magnet for a ramrod
just<00:02:36.090> shove<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> barrel<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:40.140> we

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
just shove it down the barrel so here we

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.620 
just shove it down the barrel so here we
go<00:02:40.290> double-check<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.070> sparker

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
go double-check the sparker

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.980 
go double-check the sparker
double-checks<00:02:42.630> parker<00:02:43.020> works<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> now<00:02:45.510> here's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
double-checks parker works so now here's

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.860 
double-checks parker works so now here's
the<00:02:46.140> fun<00:02:46.170> part<00:02:46.320> how<00:02:47.010> long<00:02:47.280> does<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.490> take

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the fun part how long does it take

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.270 
the fun part how long does it take
holding<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> front<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:50.130> get

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
holding it in front of this thing to get

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.210 
holding it in front of this thing to get
the<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.580> wood<00:02:51.570> gas-air<00:02:52.080> mixture<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.980> never

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the right wood gas-air mixture you never

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:07.400 
the right wood gas-air mixture you never
know<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:01.590> was<00:03:01.770> not<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.180> probably<00:03:03.180> too<00:03:03.360> long

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.130 

so<00:03:08.010> check<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.370> again<00:03:08.700> make<00:03:09.450> sure<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:09.780> spark

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
so check it again make sure we get spark

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.340 
so check it again make sure we get spark
fold<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.190> run<00:03:11.430> again

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.630 

that<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.100> little<00:03:15.250> bit<00:03:15.460> longer<00:03:15.700> we'll<00:03:16.180> see

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that was a little bit longer we'll see

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.170 
that was a little bit longer we'll see
ha<00:03:19.110> second<00:03:20.110> try<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.380> don't<00:03:20.800> believe<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.610> now

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
ha second try I don't believe it and now

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940 
ha second try I don't believe it and now
I<00:03:22.210> got<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> potato<00:03:22.900> splattered<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.590> my<00:03:23.740> wall

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
I got a potato splattered on my wall

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.620 
I got a potato splattered on my wall
over<00:03:24.310> there<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.850> works<00:03:28.180> proof<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.900> concept<00:03:30.630> now

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
over there it works proof of concept now

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.330 
over there it works proof of concept now
it<00:03:31.960> is<00:03:31.990> not<00:03:32.380> near<00:03:32.830> as<00:03:34.380> powerful<00:03:35.380> as<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it is not near as powerful as if you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.180 
it is not near as powerful as if you
were<00:03:36.460> running<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.960> know<00:03:38.080> like<00:03:38.290> ether<00:03:39.160> or

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
were running you know like ether or

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.680 
were running you know like ether or
starting<00:03:39.760> fluid<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.180> know<00:03:40.270> when<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> kid

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
starting fluid you know when I was a kid

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.770 
starting fluid you know when I was a kid
we<00:03:41.560> didn't<00:03:41.740> have<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> lot<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.070> money<00:03:42.190> but<00:03:43.150> I'm

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
we didn't have a lot of money but I'm

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.480 
we didn't have a lot of money but I'm
gonna<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.200> blaring<00:03:44.800> off<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> steam

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
gonna get this blaring off so the steam

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.000 
gonna get this blaring off so the steam
goes<00:03:45.730> away<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.360> we<00:03:46.450> go<00:03:46.710> anyway<00:03:47.710> we<00:03:47.860> didn't

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
goes away there we go anyway we didn't

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.890 
goes away there we go anyway we didn't
have<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> lot<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.370> money<00:03:48.490> so<00:03:49.300> we<00:03:49.630> couldn't

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
have a lot of money so we couldn't

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.840 
have a lot of money so we couldn't
afford<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:50.800> i<00:03:50.830> can't<00:03:51.160> eat<00:03:51.520> her<00:03:51.700> and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
afford you know i can't eat her and

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.190 
afford you know i can't eat her and
things<00:03:52.030> like<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.240> but<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:52.960> could

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
things like that but what we could

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.130 
things like that but what we could
afford<00:03:53.970> was<00:03:54.970> Aqua<00:03:55.870> Net<00:03:56.050> hairspray<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:57.490> our

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
afford was Aqua Net hairspray for our

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.190 
afford was Aqua Net hairspray for our
gas<00:03:59.140> or<00:03:59.790> propellant<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.970> i'll<00:04:01.690> tell<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.930> what

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
gas or propellant and i'll tell you what

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.140 
gas or propellant and i'll tell you what
I've<00:04:02.650> tried<00:04:02.890> everything<00:04:03.130> out<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.550> in<00:04:03.820> spud

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
I've tried everything out there in spud

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.200 
I've tried everything out there in spud
guns<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.690> there<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.800> no<00:04:06.100> more<00:04:06.430> volatile

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
guns and there is no more volatile

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
guns and there is no more volatile
substance<00:04:07.840> on<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.080> planet<00:04:08.580> than<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> cheap

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
substance on the planet than a cheap

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.770 
substance on the planet than a cheap
99-cent<00:04:11.230> can<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.740> aquanet<00:04:12.160> hairspray<00:04:12.790> so

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
99-cent can of aquanet hairspray so

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.540 
99-cent can of aquanet hairspray so
anyhow<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.740> think<00:04:14.950> we're<00:04:15.040> going<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.280> look<00:04:15.430> this

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
anyhow I think we're going to look this

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.490 
anyhow I think we're going to look this
up<00:04:15.610> one<00:04:16.150> more<00:04:16.360> time<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:18.160> fire<00:04:18.520> it<00:04:18.760> again<00:04:19.540> it's

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
up one more time and fire it again it's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.210 
up one more time and fire it again it's
not<00:04:20.770> as<00:04:21.040> powerful<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:21.880> as<00:04:22.360> an<00:04:22.900> aerosol<00:04:23.740> would

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
not as powerful as as an aerosol would

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.860 
not as powerful as as an aerosol would
be<00:04:24.400> for<00:04:24.820> propelling<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.890> know<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
be for propelling you know the the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.000 
be for propelling you know the the
numbers<00:04:29.170> I've<00:04:29.320> heard<00:04:29.560> is<00:04:29.710> when<00:04:29.890> you're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
numbers I've heard is when you're

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.460 
numbers I've heard is when you're
running<00:04:30.280> wood<00:04:30.550> gas<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:31.060> an<00:04:31.240> engine<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:32.110> about

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
running wood gas in an engine it's about

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.550 
running wood gas in an engine it's about
a<00:04:32.500> thirty<00:04:33.040> percent<00:04:33.460> power<00:04:33.700> loss<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.440> know

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
a thirty percent power loss so you know

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.490 
a thirty percent power loss so you know
I<00:04:35.770> would<00:04:36.040> assume<00:04:36.760> what<00:04:37.360> gas<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:38.080> thirty

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
I would assume what gas is about thirty

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.810 
I would assume what gas is about thirty
percent<00:04:38.860> loss<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.220> all<00:04:39.340> what's<00:04:39.550> will<00:04:39.670> then

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
percent loss of all what's will then

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.350 
percent loss of all what's will then
gasoline<00:04:40.860> which<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.070> about<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> same

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
gasoline which is about the same

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.460 
gasoline which is about the same
volatility

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
volatility

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.970 
volatility
volatility<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:45.040> most<00:04:45.370> aerosol<00:04:46.150> propellants

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
volatility is most aerosol propellants

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.270 
volatility is most aerosol propellants
so<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.310> not<00:04:48.460> as<00:04:48.730> powerful<00:04:49.830> there's<00:04:50.830> probably

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
so it's not as powerful there's probably

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.000 
so it's not as powerful there's probably
no<00:04:51.520> real<00:04:51.790> practical<00:04:52.360> use<00:04:52.750> for<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.260> but<00:04:53.980> it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
no real practical use for it but it

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.100 
no real practical use for it but it
certainly<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.640> a<00:04:54.760> whole<00:04:55.060> bunch<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.420> fun<00:04:55.630> so

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
certainly is a whole bunch of fun so

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.770 
certainly is a whole bunch of fun so
we'll<00:04:56.290> try<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.500> one<00:04:56.680> more<00:04:56.740> time<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:58.660> get
