00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hi everyone, I'm here today with these 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 two mugs of beer filled with water 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.189
 fruit because I want to talk about water 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.019
 detox 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 I'm sure most of you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.330
 he already knows what I'm talking about, but in short 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 for those unfamiliar with detox waters 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 they are waters that were born into 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.269
 parallel to the detox diet practically 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.300
 even if you don't follow this diet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.310
 by drinking these waters we can purify ourselves 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 so purify us are waters from 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.290
 drink when we want to do some time 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.510
 of diet some day in which we want 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 stay a little lighter and eat 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 we match these waters we can really 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 have we can really have gods 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 very very good effects indeed 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.300
 there are for all tastes today 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 I'll show who is how to make water 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 energizing and fat burning though 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 on my blog that you can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 find lots of recipes there is water 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.000
 of software that stimulates tanning 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 water that rocked cellulite 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.790
 purifying water detox in short there are 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 so many recipes therefore also based 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.119
 to the ingredients you like best 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.860
 but also above all to the effect that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.460
 you want to get can you really do it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.990
 so many and how they make you then has 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.580
 said I show you how I did these 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.579
 however, few words put fruit 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.619
 to vegetables than we want and about 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 200 grams for a liter of water 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.579
 me when it cuts a little more but 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.590
 okay it doesn't matter let's say it's one 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 indicative quality that's why then I go 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.090
 in infusion and therefore it is not that a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 problem that you have to leave an infusion 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.119
 one night in fusion reads in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.479
 infusion one night or at least four hours 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.040
 then the next day you drink this water e 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 possibly combining it with 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.009
 proper nutrition 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.680
 maybe by day we drink water 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.580
 detox we avoid going to the mcdonald 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.530
 because if not, then 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.650
 my name is a little ours 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.390
 intentions and therefore I for example already has 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.460
 made a liter of this 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.950
 fat burner energizing liter I will try 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.080
 to drink both so he had two 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.290
 liters and will have been good because of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.060
 I usually never drink so much and nothing 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.150
 then I'll show you how it was done 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.950

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.020

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.630
 Hello 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.709
 here is how you have seen it is very much 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.560
 simple to make 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:27.290
 now then this makes its own 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.780
 grapefruit with a lemon aftertaste 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.970
 ginger I almost don't feel I have to say ea 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.890
 I like grapefruit I like this 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.260
 a lot then I also eat lemons 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.120
 just bitten so here I like it 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.860
 the harsh if you do not like pro 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.490

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.850
 liking 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:52.070
 this instead good these goals a 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.150
 much more delicate taste just a 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:00.680
 aftertaste of strawberry kiwi fiscamente 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.750
 but for the moment I don't feel it very much 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.950
 so this is very delicate a lot 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.290
 hurry perhaps as a more delicate flavor e 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.330
