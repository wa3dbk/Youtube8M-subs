00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
another video from pure GPU today we'll

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.390 
another video from pure GPU today we'll
be<00:00:06.330> unboxing<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.319> taking<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.740> first<00:00:08.040> look<00:00:08.340> at

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
be unboxing and taking a first look at

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
now but the nice thing about this one is

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.560 
now but the nice thing about this one is
that<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.170> one's<00:00:22.439> packed<00:00:22.769> full<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.570> exclusive

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
gamers and of course it does feature

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
gamers and of course it does feature
twice<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.789> much<00:00:29.939> memory<00:00:30.210> than<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> reference

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
twice as much memory than the reference

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.520

card<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> unboxing<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
card so start off of the unboxing the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
card so start off of the unboxing the
front<00:00:34.980> panel<00:00:35.219> comes<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.809> lay<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:36.989> down

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
front panel comes up if you lay it down

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.549 
front panel comes up if you lay it down
and<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> basically<00:00:38.219> gives<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> quick<00:00:40.050> set

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and it basically gives you a quick set

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
and it basically gives you a quick set
of<00:00:40.710> specifications<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> card<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
of specifications for the card and it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
of specifications for the card and it
also<00:00:42.989> goes<00:00:43.350> over<00:00:43.739> five<00:00:44.190> key<00:00:44.489> features<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
also goes over five key features that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.260 
also goes over five key features that

way of the mirror the very top right
hand<00:01:08.070> side<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> believe<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.450> rug<00:01:09.840> color<00:01:10.470> coded

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
hand side I believe the rug color coded

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.149 
hand side I believe the rug color coded
load<00:01:11.280> indicator<00:01:11.780> which<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:13.229> change<00:01:13.950> color

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
load indicator which will change color

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
load indicator which will change color
depending<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> gret<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.990> much<00:01:16.140> load

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
depending on how a gret how much load

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
depending on how a gret how much load
your<00:01:16.590> GPU<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> underneath<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
your GPU has on it underneath that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
your GPU has on it underneath that
you've<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.020> rug<00:01:19.409> edition<00:01:19.950> GPU<00:01:20.430> tweak<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you've got your rug edition GPU tweak so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.130 
you've got your rug edition GPU tweak so
hopefully<00:01:21.479> there'll<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> few<00:01:22.020> more

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
hopefully there'll be a few more

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
hopefully there'll be a few more
features<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
features on that that you don't get in a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.230 
features on that that you don't get in a
normal<00:01:24.450> GPU<00:01:25.290> tweak<00:01:25.439> software<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> finally

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
normal GPU tweak software and finally

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
normal GPU tweak software and finally
right<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> bottom<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.680> GPU

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
right at the bottom you get your GPU

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.210 
right at the bottom you get your GPU

box over to the back nothing really on

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.090 
box over to the back nothing really on
the<00:01:43.020> sides<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.530> need<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> worry<00:01:43.979> about

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the sides that you need to worry about

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
the sides that you need to worry about
but<00:01:44.880> i'll<00:01:45.180> bring<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.600> closer<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.649> can

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
but i'll bring it bit closer as you can

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.030 
but i'll bring it bit closer as you can
see<00:01:47.009> you've<00:01:47.310> got<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.799> cooler<00:01:49.799> that's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
see you've got the the cooler that's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.530 
see you've got the the cooler that's
been<00:01:50.310> took<00:01:50.880> apart<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
been took apart you can see the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
been took apart you can see the
backplate<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> directcu<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
backplate you can see the directcu to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700 
backplate you can see the directcu to
call<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> new<00:01:54.780> cool<00:01:55.049> tech<00:01:55.350> fan

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
call it there and the new cool tech fan

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950
