00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
give us more control so what I'm going

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.130 
give us more control so what I'm going
to<00:02:40.239> do<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.900> put<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.860> my<00:02:42.280> little<00:02:42.840> my<00:02:43.840> shape

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
to do is put in my little my shape

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.020 
to do is put in my little my shape
pasting<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:47.109> then<00:02:47.950> basically<00:02:48.280> flat<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.880> my

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
pasting and then basically flat in my

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.860 
pasting and then basically flat in my
hair<00:02:49.299> I<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.280> lot<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.670> hair<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.690> think

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
hair I have a lot of hair so I think

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.300 
hair I have a lot of hair so I think
that's<00:02:52.989> why<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.410> really<00:02:53.470> hard<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:53.920> me<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.069> do

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that's why it's really hard for me to do

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.819 
that's why it's really hard for me to do
this<00:02:54.459> without<00:02:54.730> shaping<00:02:55.510> products<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:58.829> forgot
