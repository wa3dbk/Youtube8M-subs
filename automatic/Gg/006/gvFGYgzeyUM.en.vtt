my imitation system I got a black ps3 a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.430 
my imitation system I got a black ps3 a
black<00:03:45.750> xbox<00:03:46.139> 360<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:50.120> there<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.209> go<00:03:51.380> can<00:03:52.380> you

guys<00:03:52.590> see<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.720> now<00:03:54.720> touch-sensitive<00:03:55.410> keys<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
guys see it now touch-sensitive keys you

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.240 
guys see it now touch-sensitive keys you
can<00:03:56.910> see<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.480> design<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.260> kind<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.010> like

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
can see that the design is kind of like

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.259 
can see that the design is kind of like
in<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.420> an<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:02.030> don't<00:04:03.030> know<00:04:03.090> how<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
in and an out really I don't know how to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.770 
in and an out really I don't know how to
describe<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.810> compressed<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:06.239> got<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.420> bunch

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
describe that compressed you got a bunch

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.500 
describe that compressed you got a bunch
of<00:04:06.930> ports<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.590> back<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.670> I'm<00:04:09.000> hoping<00:04:09.329> that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
of ports on the back and I'm hoping that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
of ports on the back and I'm hoping that
this<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> right<00:04:09.900> way<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.440> should<00:04:10.620> be<00:04:10.650> I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
this is the right way it should be I

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.879 
this is the right way it should be I
think<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.400> yeah<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.170> here<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.410> got<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> power

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
think so yeah so here you got the power

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.500 
think so yeah so here you got the power
jack<00:04:14.639> um<00:04:17.539> AV<00:04:18.539> goes<00:04:18.900> here<00:04:19.169> hdmi<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.340> then<00:04:21.269> there

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
jack um AV goes here hdmi and then there

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.149 
jack um AV goes here hdmi and then there
is<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.289> they're<00:04:22.440> supposed<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.860> five

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
is I think they're supposed to be five

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.190 
is I think they're supposed to be five
there's<00:04:23.460> three<00:04:23.729> USB<00:04:24.030> ports<00:04:24.240> at<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.690> back<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
there's three USB ports at the back and

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.750 
there's three USB ports at the back and
there's<00:04:25.740> two<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.190> front

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
there's two in the front

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.270 
there's two in the front
someone<00:04:27.420> here<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:27.990> little<00:04:28.200> play<00:04:29.010> here

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
someone here in this little play here

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.920 
someone here in this little play here
opens<00:04:29.910> up<00:04:30.090> let's<00:04:31.020> see<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:31.140> I<00:04:31.230> can<00:04:31.260> see<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.740> I

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
opens up let's see if I can see the I

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.660 
opens up let's see if I can see the I
don't<00:04:33.930> know<00:04:33.990> if<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.650> writing<00:04:35.280> on<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
don't know if this is writing on it I

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.820 
don't know if this is writing on it I
don't<00:04:35.820> know<00:04:35.910> why<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.690> don't<00:04:37.500> really<00:04:37.620> like

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
don't know why I but I don't really like

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.420 
don't know why I but I don't really like
that<00:04:38.190> but<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.370> don't<00:04:38.580> think<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.880> remove<00:04:39.180> it

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
that but I don't think you can remove it

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.670 
that but I don't think you can remove it
so<00:04:41.430> there<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.700> closer<00:04:41.970> view<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:43.230> the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
so there is a closer view you see the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.580 
so there is a closer view you see the
fan<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.820> top<00:04:45.090> there's<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.080> big<00:04:46.350> fan

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
fan and the on the top there's a big fan

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.980 
fan and the on the top there's a big fan
here<00:04:46.920> in<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> back<00:04:47.390> this<00:04:48.390> adds<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.840> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
here in the back this adds to the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.200 
here in the back this adds to the
cooling<00:04:49.350> element<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:50.010> all<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.970> there's<00:04:51.180> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
cooling element of it all and there's a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.570 
cooling element of it all and there's a
huge<00:04:51.630> fan<00:04:52.020> at<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.260> bottom<00:04:52.620> which<00:04:53.100> doesn't

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
huge fan at the bottom which doesn't

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580 
huge fan at the bottom which doesn't
really<00:04:53.700> well<00:04:54.150> opening<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:55.080> doesn't<00:04:55.410> really

thing<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.040> can<00:04:59.160> say<00:04:59.310> about<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.610> xbox<00:04:59.820> 360

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
thing you can say about the xbox 360

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.230 
thing you can say about the xbox 360
slim<00:05:01.080> 250<00:05:01.920> is<00:05:02.070> not<00:05:02.310> only<00:05:02.460> does<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.730> look<00:05:02.850> nice

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
slim 250 is not only does it look nice

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.860 
slim 250 is not only does it look nice
but<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.710> main<00:05:04.950> concern<00:05:05.460> has<00:05:05.640> been<00:05:05.670> that<00:05:06.120> if

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
but the main concern has been that if

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.200 
but the main concern has been that if
you<00:05:07.410> move<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:08.070> thing<00:05:08.370> while<00:05:08.850> you're<00:05:08.880> playing

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
you move this thing while you're playing

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.670 
you move this thing while you're playing
on<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.600> game<00:05:09.870> when<00:05:10.140> we<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.560> CD<00:05:10.890> inside<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.430> DVD

on a game when we have a CD inside a DVD

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.960 
on a game when we have a CD inside a DVD
it's<00:05:13.680> going<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.950> scratch<00:05:14.370> up<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.790> mess<00:05:14.940> up

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
it's going to scratch up and mess up

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.910 
it's going to scratch up and mess up
your<00:05:15.240> disc<00:05:15.450> but<00:05:16.050> why<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.590> first<00:05:16.830> place

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
your disc but why in the first place

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.470 
your disc but why in the first place
would<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.250> be<00:05:17.370> moving<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:17.910> while<00:05:18.270> there's

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
would you be moving this while there's

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.840 
would you be moving this while there's
disc<00:05:18.810> inside<00:05:19.230> it<00:05:19.470> doesn't<00:05:19.710> make<00:05:19.800> sense<00:05:19.860> so

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
disc inside it doesn't make sense so

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.210 
disc inside it doesn't make sense so
aside<00:05:21.450> from<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.780> don't<00:05:22.290> move<00:05:22.440> your<00:05:22.680> new<00:05:22.800> xbox
