in<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> plug<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.190> into<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:27.580> network

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
in there you plug it into your network

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.330 
in there you plug it into your network
and<00:02:28.150> off<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> goes<00:02:28.660> yes<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.680> course<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.100> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
and off it goes yes of course then the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.390 
and off it goes yes of course then the
all<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.630> put<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.290> DS<00:02:32.440> function<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
all the that put in the DS function the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.900 
all the that put in the DS function the
video<00:02:33.700> press<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.350> 999<00:02:35.350> userís<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.760> so

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
video press is 999 userís that's it so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.280 
video press is 999 userís that's it so
all<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.300> package<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.840> get<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.080> you're<00:02:38.230> off

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
all one package you get it you're off

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.000 
all one package you get it you're off
and<00:02:38.380> running<00:02:38.440> now<00:02:38.680> what<00:02:38.830> are<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> other

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
and running now what are the other

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
and running now what are the other
problems<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.490> happens<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.120> when<00:02:40.660> you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
problems that happens is that when you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.120 
problems that happens is that when you
plug<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.110> your<00:02:41.200> camera<00:02:41.410> sometimes<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
plug in your camera sometimes you have

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.100 
plug in your camera sometimes you have
audio<00:02:42.790> delay<00:02:43.239> do<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> way<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> address

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
audio delay do you have a way to address

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.630 
audio delay do you have a way to address
the<00:02:44.320> audio<00:02:44.590> delay<00:02:44.860> yeah<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.280> course<00:02:45.489> no

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the audio delay yeah of course no

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.420 
the audio delay yeah of course no
problem<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:46.120> ones<00:02:46.360> has<00:02:47.080> audio<00:02:47.380> mixer<00:02:47.860> so

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
problem this ones has audio mixer so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.570 
problem this ones has audio mixer so
right<00:02:48.730> which<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.270> input<00:02:49.989> 4<00:02:50.380> HDMI<00:02:51.070> embedded

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
right which can input 4 HDMI embedded

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.440 
right which can input 4 HDMI embedded
video<00:02:51.790> audio<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.130> actually<00:02:54.130> audio<00:02:54.760> then

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
video audio and actually audio then

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.080 
video audio and actually audio then
every<00:02:56.230> time<00:02:56.410> actually<00:02:56.709> audio<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.820> little

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
every time actually audio is a little

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.990 
every time actually audio is a little
bit<00:02:58.180> faster<00:02:58.989> than<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.530> HDMI<00:03:00.040> video<00:03:00.190> no

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
bit faster than the HDMI video no

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.540 
bit faster than the HDMI video no
problem<00:03:01.600> here<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.170> an<00:03:02.410> audio<00:03:02.680> delay<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.489> can

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
problem here it's an audio delay you can

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
problem here it's an audio delay you can
tweak<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:03.880> until<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.239> get<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.660> course<00:03:04.989> very

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
tweak it until you get it of course very

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.570 
tweak it until you get it of course very
cool<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.739> then<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.010> want<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.190> record

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
cool and then if you want to record

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.340 
cool and then if you want to record
something<00:03:07.330> off<00:03:07.570> of<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> would<00:03:08.020> guess<00:03:08.170> just

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
something off of here I would guess just

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.080 
something off of here I would guess just
run<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> program<00:03:08.890> out<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.220> something<00:03:09.400> an<00:03:09.640> HDMI

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
run the program out to something an HDMI

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.880 
run the program out to something an HDMI
input<00:03:10.120> device<00:03:10.630> or<00:03:10.870> something<00:03:10.989> like<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.290> no

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
input device or something like that no

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.380 
input device or something like that no
problem<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.790> rig<00:03:12.940> doesn't<00:03:13.120> record

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
problem this rig doesn't record

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.199 
problem this rig doesn't record
internally<00:03:13.900> though<00:03:14.049> right<00:03:14.230> yes<00:03:14.670> yeah<00:03:15.670> all

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
internally though right yes yeah all

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.150 
internally though right yes yeah all
right<00:03:16.450> which<00:03:16.600> has<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> SD<00:03:17.320> memory<00:03:17.440> card<00:03:17.920> slot

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
right which has a SD memory card slot

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.030 
right which has a SD memory card slot
back<00:03:18.340> side<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.269> can<00:03:19.420> leak<00:03:19.630> out<00:03:20.040> recall

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
back side so you can leak out recall

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.970 
back side so you can leak out recall
then<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.400> live<00:03:21.580> live<00:03:22.390> streaming<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.799> can

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
then the live live streaming is you can

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.449 
then the live live streaming is you can
you<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.430> choose<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.680> hard<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.739> say<00:03:26.890> that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
you can choose it's a hard to say that

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.990 
you can choose it's a hard to say that
one<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.910> other<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.950> what<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> record

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
one of the other what what is a record

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.890 
one of the other what what is a record
at<00:03:31.090> 1080p<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:32.260> call<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.560> uh<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.030> tuning

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
at 1080p they call it uh just the tuning

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.470 
at 1080p they call it uh just the tuning
the<00:03:35.140> software<00:03:35.530> right<00:03:35.709> now<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.100> Leacock<00:03:37.120> just

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the software right now but Leacock just

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.750 
the software right now but Leacock just
