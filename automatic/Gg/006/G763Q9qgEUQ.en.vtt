that in quite a bit of detail in a short
one<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:28.039> before<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> start<00:00:29.429> let<00:00:30.300> me<00:00:30.330> just

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
one now before I start let me just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.080 
one now before I start let me just
explain<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.590> post<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.340> way<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
explain a bit about the post so way the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.979 
explain a bit about the post so way the
post<00:00:33.360> works<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.489> liner<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.210> steel

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
post works is we have a liner a steel

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
post works is we have a liner a steel
and<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.760> stop<00:00:39.480> ends<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.090> stop

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and to stop ends now you place one stop

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
and to stop ends now you place one stop
head<00:00:42.800> into<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:45.570> liner<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.579> my<00:00:47.579> colleague

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
head into the liner like so my colleague

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.229 
head into the liner like so my colleague
puts<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.230> side<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.879> gets

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
puts in on the other side it then gets

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.720 
puts in on the other side it then gets
locked<00:00:51.980> into<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.270> steel<00:00:54.539> post<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
locked into the steel post and that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.229 
locked into the steel post and that
creates<00:00:57.149> them<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.690> barrier<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.620> each<00:00:58.859> end<00:00:59.239> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
creates them a barrier at each end of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.439 
creates them a barrier at each end of
the<00:01:00.449> post<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:01.350> each<00:01:01.680> stop<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.370> stop<00:01:03.180> ends

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the post now each stop these stop ends

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.050 
the post now each stop these stop ends
can<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.660> moved<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.760> create<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
can be moved up or down to create a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.500 
can be moved up or down to create a
bigger<00:01:06.390> smaller<00:01:06.990> post<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.740> per<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.820> ask<00:01:09.180> how

about nine foot and that the smallest

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
about nine foot and that the smallest
well<00:01:18.659> produces<00:01:19.350> big<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.890> small<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:21.740> two

well produces big or small as one two
bit<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.159> boom<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.700> 4x4<00:01:24.180> post<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.080> our

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bit let's boom this 4x4 post and our

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
bit let's boom this 4x4 post and our
standard<00:01:25.710> post<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.250> most<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> us<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.360> were

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
standard post is most of us that were

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
standard post is most of us that were
posted<00:01:27.750> five<00:01:28.110> before<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> means

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
posted five before now what that means

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.200 
posted five before now what that means
is<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> poor<00:01:31.200> before<00:01:31.560> meaning<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.880> side

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is with a poor before meaning this side

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.800 
is with a poor before meaning this side
is<00:01:33.450> four<00:01:33.900> inches<00:01:34.350> by<00:01:34.829> four<00:01:35.189> inches<00:01:35.509> you'll<00:01:36.509> get

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
is four inches by four inches you'll get

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
is four inches by four inches you'll get
a<00:01:37.020> lighter<00:01:37.350> products<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:38.400> less<00:01:38.610> concrete

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
a lighter products using less concrete

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.350 
a lighter products using less concrete
but<00:01:39.479> producing<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> stronger<00:01:40.799> product

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
but producing just a stronger product

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.870 
but producing just a stronger product
that<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.500> sell<00:01:42.770> for<00:01:42.800> roughly<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.700> same

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
that you can sell for roughly the same

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.950 
that you can sell for roughly the same
moment<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.290> now<00:01:46.120> I'm<00:01:47.120> going<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> go<00:01:47.450> into<00:01:47.600> why

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
moment so now I'm going to go into why

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.710 
moment so now I'm going to go into why
is<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.470> -<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:48.890> before<00:01:49.220> more<00:01:49.700> special<00:01:50.240> than<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
is this - for before more special than a

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.070 
is this - for before more special than a
five<00:01:50.930> well<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.550> more<00:01:52.760> special<00:01:53.000> because<00:01:53.600> we

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
five well it's more special because we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.700 
five well it's more special because we
have<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.560> brand<00:01:55.010> new<00:01:55.150> as<00:01:56.150> slop<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:56.930> basically<00:01:57.350> I

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
have a brand new as slop so basically I

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.910 
have a brand new as slop so basically I
take<00:01:58.010> this<00:01:58.190> out<00:01:59.530> the<00:02:00.530> slop<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:01.610> or<00:02:02.920> Lisa

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
take this out the slop here or Lisa

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.680 
take this out the slop here or Lisa
shown<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.640> slope<00:02:04.940> here<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:06.490> 55<00:02:07.690> millimeters

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
shown the slope here is 55 millimeters

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.860 
shown the slope here is 55 millimeters
or<00:02:09.020> roughly<00:02:09.560> about<00:02:09.679> two<00:02:10.100> inches<00:02:10.520> wide

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
or roughly about two inches wide

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.990 
or roughly about two inches wide
now<00:02:12.020> that's<00:02:12.200> wider<00:02:12.500> than<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.890> standard<00:02:13.370> and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
now that's wider than the standard and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240 
now that's wider than the standard and
that<00:02:14.030> means<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.750> your<00:02:15.380> wooden<00:02:15.680> panels<00:02:16.160> it

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that means that your wooden panels it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.850 
that means that your wooden panels it
might<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.550> slightly<00:02:16.850> wider<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:18.050> concrete

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
might be slightly wider your concrete

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.800 
might be slightly wider your concrete
panels<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.310> might<00:02:19.489> be<00:02:19.640> specialized<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.570> may

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
panels that might be specialized and may

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.870 
panels that might be specialized and may
be<00:02:20.870> slightly<00:02:21.290> wide<00:02:21.530> again<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.400> fit<00:02:22.670> into

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
be slightly wide again will fit into

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.350 
be slightly wide again will fit into
your<00:02:23.120> concrete<00:02:23.690> fence<00:02:23.930> much<00:02:24.650> easier<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.300> less

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
your concrete fence much easier and less

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.110 
your concrete fence much easier and less
hassle<00:02:26.810> meaning<00:02:27.620> much<00:02:28.370> easier<00:02:28.730> product<00:02:29.030> to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
hassle meaning much easier product to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.570 
hassle meaning much easier product to
use<00:02:29.270> overall<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.350> four<00:02:30.560> before<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
use overall the four before is like that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.940 
use overall the four before is like that
so<00:02:31.850> it's<00:02:31.970> easy<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.360> transport<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.410> easier<00:02:33.709> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so it's easy to transport it's easier to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.630 
so it's easy to transport it's easier to
place<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:35.360> also<00:02:36.260> take<00:02:36.770> up<00:02:36.920> less<00:02:37.160> room<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.550> your

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.050 
place and also take up less room in your
yard

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
yard

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.060

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
putting it to create the barrier in the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.509 
putting it to create the barrier in the
middle<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:51.260> both<00:02:51.530> fill<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.980> pocket<00:02:52.370> we

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
middle it both fill in the pocket we

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.380 
middle it both fill in the pocket we
would<00:02:52.700> put<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.630> steel<00:02:54.350> cage<00:02:54.709> inside<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.880> well<00:02:56.180> as
