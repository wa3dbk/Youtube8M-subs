00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the top three things we did to make it a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.110 
the top three things we did to make it a
natural<00:01:01.109> organic<00:01:01.530> bookcase<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> use<00:01:02.879> books

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
natural organic bookcase is to use books

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530 
natural organic bookcase is to use books
that<00:01:03.270> were<00:01:03.359> neutral<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.379> add<00:01:04.970> warm<00:01:05.970> elements

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that were neutral to add warm elements

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
that were neutral to add warm elements
in<00:01:06.750> metals<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.590> brass<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.520> bit<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in metals and brass and a little bit of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
in metals and brass and a little bit of
natural<00:01:09.450> feeling<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.900> mats<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.590> neat

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
natural feeling and mats are really neat

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
natural feeling and mats are really neat
so<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.250> reims<00:01:11.490> those<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.090> innately<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so in reims those are innately and I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
so in reims those are innately and I
think<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.710> last<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> makes<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> feel

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
think the last thing that makes it feel

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.600 
think the last thing that makes it feel
a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.479> mortal<00:01:15.869> organic<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.369> put

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a little mortal organic is that we put

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
a little mortal organic is that we put
the<00:01:17.700> books<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.119> horizontally<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> think

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the books all horizontally which I think

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
the books all horizontally which I think
softens<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> bookcase<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.729> doesn't<00:01:21.000> make

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
softens the bookcase and it doesn't make

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.710 
softens the bookcase and it doesn't make
it<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.299> structure<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:23.090> think<00:01:24.090> color<00:01:24.270> blocking

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
it a structure I think color blocking

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
it a structure I think color blocking
was<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.170> fun<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> easy<00:01:25.950> way<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> make

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
was a really fun and easy way to make

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.920 
was a really fun and easy way to make
your<00:01:27.000> bookshelves<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.780> good

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
your bookshelves look really good

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
your bookshelves look really good
because<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.040> sort<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because all you have to do is sort your

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.749 
because all you have to do is sort your
books<00:01:29.700> by<00:01:29.909> color<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.049> gives<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> visual

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
books by color and it gives you a visual

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
books by color and it gives you a visual
organisation<00:01:32.759> opposed<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.750> something<00:01:34.380> that's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
organisation opposed to something that's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
organisation opposed to something that's
chronological<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.759> alphabetical<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.630> love

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
chronological or alphabetical I love

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
chronological or alphabetical I love
putting<00:01:37.229> storage<00:01:37.590> boxes<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.250> book<00:01:38.430> cases

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
putting storage boxes in my book cases

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
putting storage boxes in my book cases
because<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.540> gives<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> quick<00:01:40.350> place<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
because it gives you a quick place to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
because it gives you a quick place to
throw<00:01:41.009> photos<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.299> extra<00:01:42.930> keys<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
throw photos or extra keys you can just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
throw photos or extra keys you can just
dash<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.310> away<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.700> those<00:01:44.820> boxes<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> keep

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
dash them away in those boxes and keep

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
dash them away in those boxes and keep
them<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.140> sight<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> nice

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
them in sight and I think it's a nice

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
them in sight and I think it's a nice
break<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.149> sorts<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> books<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> have

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649

thing<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.730> thought<00:02:14.090> would<00:02:14.240> be<00:02:14.300> good<00:02:14.630> was<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
thing I thought would be good was the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.760 
thing I thought would be good was the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
on them hmm and I thought it was pretty

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.450 
on them hmm and I thought it was pretty
cool<00:02:23.120> because<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.510> lean<00:02:23.810> them<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.890> pretty

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
cool because I lean them up but pretty

to<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> black<00:02:25.970> background<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.990> even<00:02:27.770> though

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to a black background and even though

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.800 
to a black background and even though
it's<00:02:28.040> small<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.910> nice<00:02:29.090> little<00:02:29.300> easier<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it's small it's a nice little easier I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.740 
it's small it's a nice little easier I
didn't<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.170> I'd<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.100> did<00:02:31.400> I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
didn't think I'd like it but I did I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.000 
didn't think I'd like it but I did I
don't<00:02:32.750> think<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:33.110> stress<00:02:33.440> enough<00:02:33.710> how<00:02:33.770> much

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
don't think I can stress enough how much

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.220 
don't think I can stress enough how much
I<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.760> add<00:02:34.880> accessories<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> bookshelf

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
I think that adds your layers that you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.290 
I think that adds your layers that you
need<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> bookshelf<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.940> we<00:02:40.940> had<00:02:41.090> some

really cute clocks and just these little
moments<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.740> add<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.190> each<00:02:46.310> shelf

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
moments and that you add to each shelf

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.170 
moments and that you add to each shelf
really<00:02:47.330> really<00:02:47.480> set<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.900> apart<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:49.090> had<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> lot

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180

of<00:02:50.330> fun<00:02:50.600> with<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.780> vocation<00:02:51.290> challenge<00:02:51.950> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
of fun with this vocation challenge I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.360 
of fun with this vocation challenge I
thought<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:52.820> really<00:02:53.030> cool<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.890> give<00:02:54.890> three

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
thought it was really cool to give three

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.840 
thought it was really cool to give three
looks<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.600> one<00:02:56.840> bookcase<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.550> fast

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
looks to one bookcase and it's so fast

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.790 
looks to one bookcase and it's so fast
and<00:02:59.180> quick<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.540> do<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.690> think<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.170> forget<00:03:00.470> when

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
and quick to do I think you forget when

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.110 
and quick to do I think you forget when
you're<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:01.040> own<00:03:01.220> house<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.850> you're<00:03:02.000> like

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you're in your own house and you're like

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.760 
you're in your own house and you're like
I<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.720> time<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.560> really

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
I don't have time for this but it really

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.740 
I don't have time for this but it really
doesn't<00:03:04.010> take<00:03:04.160> very<00:03:04.430> long<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.940> change<00:03:05.540> that

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
doesn't take very long to change that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.690 
doesn't take very long to change that
and<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.230> think<00:03:06.410> what<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.400> take

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
and I think what you have to do is take

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.120 
and I think what you have to do is take
everything<00:03:08.480> off<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.810> bookshelf<00:03:09.230> right<00:03:09.770> yeah

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
everything off the bookshelf right yeah

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.280 
everything off the bookshelf right yeah
start<00:03:10.520> fresh<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.270> put<00:03:11.450> everything<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:12.140> on

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
start fresh so put everything that's on

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.140 
start fresh so put everything that's on
your<00:03:12.500> bookshelf<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.459> floor<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:13.910> then

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
your bookshelf on the floor and then

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
your bookshelf on the floor and then
start<00:03:14.540> adding<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.110> because<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.620> gives

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
start adding to that because that gives

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.710 
start adding to that because that gives
you<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> real<00:03:16.550> clean<00:03:17.330> slate

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780 

you
