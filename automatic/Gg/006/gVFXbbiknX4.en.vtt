00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
seems to be a really recurring theme

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.630 
seems to be a really recurring theme
with<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.170> redstone<00:00:25.350> videos<00:00:25.890> involve<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.609> use

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with my redstone videos involve the use

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720 
with my redstone videos involve the use
of<00:00:27.000> yes<00:00:27.570> again<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.260> redstone<00:00:28.680> comparator<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of yes again the redstone comparator the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
of yes again the redstone comparator the
main<00:00:29.910> reason<00:00:30.630> why<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.990> using<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> redstone

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
main reason why I'm using the redstone

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.290 
main reason why I'm using the redstone
comparator<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> most

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
comparator is that this is the most

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920 
comparator is that this is the most
compact<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.950> making<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.790> redstone<00:00:36.420> clock

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
compact way of making a redstone clock

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
compact way of making a redstone clock
with<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.590> Minecraft<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> mean<00:00:39.390> by

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with in Minecraft now what I mean by

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.910 
with in Minecraft now what I mean by
redstone<00:00:39.840> clock<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:40.739> mean<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
redstone clock because I don't mean a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.270 
redstone clock because I don't mean a
clock<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.510> actual<00:00:43.050> daytime<00:00:43.920> or

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
clock as in an actual daytime or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
clock as in an actual daytime or
nighttime<00:00:44.640> clock<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
nighttime clock what I mean is it's a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
nighttime clock what I mean is it's a
clock<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.010> repeats<00:00:47.579> every<00:00:48.059> couple<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> ticks

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
clock that repeats every couple of ticks

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.010 
clock that repeats every couple of ticks
and<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:49.950> configurable<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.390> now

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and it's very configurable as well now

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.119 
and it's very configurable as well now
i'm<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> show<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.469> guys<00:00:52.590> how<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> build

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
i'm going to show you guys how you build

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.049 
i'm going to show you guys how you build
it<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:53.820> simple<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.899> need<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
it is very very simple all you need is a

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
it is very very simple all you need is a
redstone<00:00:57.059> torch<00:00:57.180> won't<00:00:57.809> comparator<00:00:58.379> 2

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
redstone torch won't comparator 2

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
redstone torch won't comparator 2
repeaters<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.570> also<00:01:00.719> need<00:01:01.079> free<00:01:01.379> bits<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
repeaters and you also need free bits of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
repeaters and you also need free bits of
wire<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> have

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
wire so you want to make sure you have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
wire so you want to make sure you have
your<00:01:03.719> redstone<00:01:04.080> torch<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
your redstone torch down like this and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420 
your redstone torch down like this and
then<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.880> place<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.810> comparator<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
then you place your comparator right in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
then you place your comparator right in
front<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> important<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
front now the important thing about this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.070 
front now the important thing about this
is<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.570> subtraction<00:01:12.570> mode

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is that it has to be in subtraction mode

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
is that it has to be in subtraction mode
which<00:01:13.439> means<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.280> right-click

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
which means that you have to right-click

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
which means that you have to right-click
the<00:01:15.030> comparator<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the comparator to make sure that this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.060 
the comparator to make sure that this
redstone<00:01:17.490> torch<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
redstone torch bit is on so you need to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.530 
redstone torch bit is on so you need to
make<00:01:20.189> sure<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> subtraction<00:01:21.090> mode

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
make sure it's in subtraction mode

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
make sure it's in subtraction mode
you'll<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.650> make<00:01:22.799> sure<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.159> place

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you'll then want to make sure you place

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
you'll then want to make sure you place
a<00:01:23.520> repeater<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> redstone<00:01:25.680> dust

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a repeater there a bit of redstone dust

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
a repeater there a bit of redstone dust
there<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> basically

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
there and there and then you basically

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.830 
there and there and then you basically
place<00:01:28.259> another<00:01:28.680> repeater<00:01:29.540> pointing<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
place another repeater pointing in the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
place another repeater pointing in the
opposite<00:01:31.170> direction<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> place

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
opposite direction and then you place

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
opposite direction and then you place
another<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> rust<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> then

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
another bit of rust on there and then

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.580 
another bit of rust on there and then
bingo<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.420> compact<00:01:36.930> redstone

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
bingo you have a very compact redstone

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
bingo you have a very compact redstone
clock<00:01:37.799> which<00:01:38.220> ticks<00:01:38.579> away<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.930> could

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
clock which ticks away and you could

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
clock which ticks away and you could
literally<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:40.860> say<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.790> piston<00:01:42.270> right

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
literally let's say I get a piston right

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
literally let's say I get a piston right
here<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.530> attach<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> piston<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
here I can attach this piston to here

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
here I can attach this piston to here
and<00:01:44.939> let<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> guys<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and let the guys can see right there it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.090 
and let the guys can see right there it
will<00:01:46.710> act<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.460> rare<00:01:47.820> stone<00:01:48.090> Fox<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.040> how<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
will act as a rare stone Fox so how you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
will act as a rare stone Fox so how you
actually<00:01:50.340> increase<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.939> length<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
actually increase the length of this is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
actually increase the length of this is
that<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:53.280> increase<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> delay

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that you actually can increase the delay

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
that you actually can increase the delay
within<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> redstone<00:01:55.560> repeaters<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.280> here

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
within the redstone repeaters right here

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
within the redstone repeaters right here
you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> make<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.140> completely

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you can make it so that it is completely

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.550 
you can make it so that it is completely
full<00:01:59.189> delay<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.149> slows<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.320> tick

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
full delay and this slows down the tick

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
full delay and this slows down the tick
quite<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.579> another<00:02:03.570> thing<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.020> do

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
quite a lot another thing you could do

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.889 
quite a lot another thing you could do
as<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.579> could<00:02:05.759> literally<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
as well is that you could literally if I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
as well is that you could literally if I
need<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.110> show<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.409> guys<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.520> go<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
need to show you guys if we go back to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140 
need to show you guys if we go back to
this<00:02:10.020> level<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this level right here where we have the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.590 
this level right here where we have the
compare

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
compare

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.790 
compare
so<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.350> place<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:15.240> can<00:02:15.480> replace<00:02:15.810> two<00:02:16.380> we

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so we can place a we can replace two we

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.190 
so we can place a we can replace two we
can<00:02:16.950> put<00:02:17.160> two<00:02:17.340> repeaters<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.990> we

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
can put two repeaters like that then we

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800 
can put two repeaters like that then we
loop<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.740> back<00:02:19.770> round<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:21.030> another<00:02:21.390> repeater

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
loop it back round get another repeater

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380 
loop it back round get another repeater
bring<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.530> back<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.520> put<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> back<00:02:24.060> into

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
bring it back and then put it back into

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420 
bring it back and then put it back into
the<00:02:24.480> comparator<00:02:25.050> again<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.250> make

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the comparator again and this would make

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.020 
the comparator again and this would make
a<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.410> if<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.590> set<00:02:28.830> all<00:02:29.040> these<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.490> very<00:02:29.820> low

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
a a if we set all these to a very low

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
a a if we set all these to a very low
setting<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.960> can<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.650> actually

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
setting you can see that we can actually

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.920 
setting you can see that we can actually
slow<00:02:32.370> down<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.760> clock<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.540> really

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
slow down the clock really really

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.560 
slow down the clock really really
significantly<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.090> video

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
significantly so this was just a video

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.360 
significantly so this was just a video
which<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.110> thought<00:02:37.320> would<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.530> useful<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:38.130> some

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
which I thought would be useful to some

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.340 
which I thought would be useful to some
people<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.820> may<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.120> new<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.450> Minecraft<00:02:39.780> or

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
people that may be new to Minecraft or

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.860 
people that may be new to Minecraft or
did<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:41.100> about<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
did not know about this this use of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.290 
did not know about this this use of
comparators<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.920> hope<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.460> guys<00:02:44.700> learned

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
comparators so hope you guys learned

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.060 
comparators so hope you guys learned
something<00:02:45.390> new<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.140> video<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> guys
