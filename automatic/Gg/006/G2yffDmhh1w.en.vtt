 So this one here, and she's like that. 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.500
 her magnetic clasp then she closes 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.950
 so it does not have a peak lock 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 there you open it and she is so she has a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 mega mirror you will see type or 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.430
 My referral glove but it's okay, my 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 super big and their colors are this 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 hence 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.369
 She has ten colors of pigments and she comes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.460
 with one who thought the sky and is legal 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.310

 I did this makeup with her I already 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.940

 using this palette this law that I am 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.879
 using and people are very cool, I'm going 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.140
 get some shade to do 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:31.439
 demonstration for you but we were there 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.959
 I'm going to pick up this yellow one that is 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:39.269
 well I got this pique because pink fluorine 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.489
 never pepper 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:50.730
 This one is very strange รณ a purple one that if I 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:56.939
 I think it's beautiful anp and what's a blue 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 Take this one then you have these super colors. 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:05.040
 I arrived and people her pigmentation is 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.230
 very good there is however when you use in 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.200
 I look for it to be a long time invented and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.200
 is a loose pigment is you use a 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.780
 white base with these two things here and 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.569
 It's orange too, these two things here. 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.389
 what are the things they are good as well flur 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:27.060
 you use with a shadow base 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.760
 that gives a legal background and is 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.479
 better and people 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.549
 the duration is good is a palette of urban 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:40.560
 decay has nothing to wish on the other 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.359
 shadows super beautiful and super mara and so 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.290
 people love 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:51.109
 except for these colors here and the green one 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.419
 green color that has these 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.909
 different so it has a pigmentation 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.959
 more different a reflection glare 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 different you can do with 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.500
 makeup using from 120 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.569
 china colors 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.720
 You get the same result as that. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.530
 You know then she's really cool if you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.979
 want to say so 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.409
 Good palette that has super bafonic colors 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.719
 c you're going to use she does not know is 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.750
 definitely does not look like a palette 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.400
 to be used on a daily basis then why 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.860
 People look at this as it does. 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.169
 day to day colors are super super ultra 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.090
 mega paulo I arrived so I loved the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.130
 I really liked colors and food 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.430
 excellent and that's it people do not know 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.800
 what about this palette at the price 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.039
 the price is not far behind the others 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:05:07.220
 she was 38 pounds I paid 38 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:05:09.479
 palms and then 36 to 2020 to 2023 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.949

 liked the release of urban decay 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.150
 I guess that's kind of like escaping a 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.889
 of the lakers that he is 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.680
 showing one naked behind the other and the 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.300
 complaining then they met the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.360
 request from the public but tell me what 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.550
