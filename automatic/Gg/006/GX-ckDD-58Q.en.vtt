names right on these doesn't having
troubled<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> Japanese<00:00:11.610> ones<00:00:12.080> just<00:00:13.080> uh<00:00:13.200> I

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
troubled the Japanese ones just uh I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.919 
troubled the Japanese ones just uh I
don't<00:00:13.980> know<00:00:14.130> why<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.360> I'm<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.719> thinking

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
don't know why I'm I'm just not thinking

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
don't know why I'm I'm just not thinking
I'm<00:00:16.260> making<00:00:16.500> these<00:00:16.590> videos<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.730> if

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I'm making these videos but let's see if

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.130 
I'm making these videos but let's see if
I<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> card<00:00:18.359> trick<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.900> having

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I can get the card trick I was having

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.090 
I can get the card trick I was having
trouble<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.500> while<00:00:19.529> ago

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
trouble a while ago

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.679 
trouble a while ago
it<00:00:20.250> might<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.699> two<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.300> those<00:00:21.449> ones

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
it might be one two and then those ones

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.540 
it might be one two and then those ones
I'll<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.189> does<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.490> have

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I'll see you see what it does I have

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
I'll see you see what it does I have
treat<00:00:23.789> okay<00:00:24.449> maybe<00:00:24.720> not

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
treat okay maybe not

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410 
treat okay maybe not
so<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> front<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> new

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so the front one there's a new

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.250 
so the front one there's a new
holographic<00:00:27.800> that's<00:00:28.800> nice<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.810> mite

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
holographic that's nice we have a mite

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.970 
holographic that's nice we have a mite

Wooper<00:00:41.780> Charmander<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.079> must<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.379> secret

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
Wooper Charmander this must be secret

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.369 
Wooper Charmander this must be secret
wonders<00:00:44.090> or<00:00:45.090> part<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.660> least<00:00:45.690> venomoth

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
wonders or part of it at least venomoth

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.880 
wonders or part of it at least venomoth
Oh<00:00:46.969> an<00:00:47.969> electric<00:00:48.390> energy<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.829> eatery<00:00:50.100> No

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.990 

so<00:00:54.489> I'm<00:00:55.059> not<00:00:55.149> just<00:00:55.210> be<00:00:55.510> like<00:00:56.309> top<00:00:57.309> cards<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.820> the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
so I'm not just be like top cards of the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.849 
so I'm not just be like top cards of the
holographic<00:00:58.780> cards<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.320> move<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.589> right<00:00:59.739> to

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
holographic cards to move that right to

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.760 
holographic cards to move that right to
the<00:00:59.890> back<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.100> pack<00:01:00.429> right<00:01:00.640> away<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.530> be<00:01:05.649> nice

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the back of pack right away so be nice

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.770 
the back of pack right away so be nice
to<00:01:06.310> get<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.549> Charizard<00:01:06.909> I'm<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.509> sure<00:01:07.659> if<00:01:07.720> you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
to get a Charizard I'm not sure if you

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.330 
to get a Charizard I'm not sure if you
can<00:01:07.869> get<00:01:07.990> one<00:01:08.140> but<00:01:08.619> if<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.009> secret

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
can get one but if this is a secret

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.240 
can get one but if this is a secret
wonder<00:01:09.610> said<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.850> know<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.060> can<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.380> here<00:01:11.680> we

but there it is there's a holographic
card<00:01:53.280> gasps<00:01:54.280> throw<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.610> on<00:01:54.729> Wes<00:01:55.060> see<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.299> believe

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
card gasps throw it on Wes see I believe

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.949 
card gasps throw it on Wes see I believe
it<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:57.269> so<00:01:58.269> on<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.539> third<00:01:58.780> track<00:01:59.019> here

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
it is so on to the third track here

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.999 
it is so on to the third track here
that's<00:02:01.959> one<00:02:02.200> bad<00:02:02.379> thing<00:02:02.410> about<00:02:02.619> buying

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
that's one bad thing about buying

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.609 
that's one bad thing about buying
