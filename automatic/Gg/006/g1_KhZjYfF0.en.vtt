00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that's just because this is how the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.510 
that's just because this is how the
front<00:00:40.800> looks<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.309> how<00:00:42.149> old<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
front looks like how old is that for a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.750 
front looks like how old is that for a
packaging<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.050> first<00:00:46.260> time<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
packaging this is the first time that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
packaging this is the first time that
Apple<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> doing<00:00:48.210> something<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.960> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Apple is doing something like that we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
Apple is doing something like that we
are<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.100> sure<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.610> exactly<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.690> reason

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
are not sure what exactly the reason

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139

and<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.240> something<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.780> was<00:03:46.990> talking

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350

about<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.860> little<00:03:48.370> while<00:03:48.610> earlier<00:03:48.850> also<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
about a little while earlier also the

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.150 
about a little while earlier also the
eight<00:03:50.650> megapixel<00:03:50.920> camera<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.900> fix+<00:03:52.900> has<00:03:53.770> a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
eight megapixel camera on the fix+ has a

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.680 
eight megapixel camera on the fix+ has a
protruding<00:03:54.820> lens<00:03:56.070> which<00:03:57.070> you<00:03:57.760> might<00:03:57.940> see<00:03:58.240> well

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
protruding lens which you might see well

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.590 
protruding lens which you might see well
this<00:03:58.900> one<00:03:59.170> comes<00:03:59.380> with<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.590> black<00:04:00.600> surrounding

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
this one comes with a black surrounding

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.100 
this one comes with a black surrounding
I<00:04:01.690> mean<00:04:01.810> view<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:03.360> printing<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.480> bit<00:04:04.870> and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
I mean view it's printing a bit and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.310 
I mean view it's printing a bit and
which<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.100> why<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.700> Apple<00:04:07.420> has<00:04:07.570> bothered<00:04:08.170> to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
which is why that Apple has bothered to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.930 
which is why that Apple has bothered to
include<00:04:08.710> a<00:04:08.920> hole<00:04:09.700> over<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.710> so<00:04:11.710> I<00:04:12.070> mean<00:04:12.760> it's

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
include a hole over here so I mean it's

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.780 
include a hole over here so I mean it's
it's<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.660> bad<00:04:13.900> actually<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:15.010> not<00:04:15.280> it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
it's that bad actually if it's not it

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.190 
it's that bad actually if it's not it
will<00:04:16.390> be<00:04:16.450> something<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.080> will

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
will be something that you will

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.680 
will be something that you will
obviously<00:04:17.800> notice<00:04:18.250> once<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.550> hold<00:04:18.790> your<00:04:19.480> hand

have absolutely nothing so the power key
button<00:05:08.980> has<00:05:09.520> gone<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:11.170> right<00:05:11.440> right<00:05:12.310> side

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
button has gone to the right right side

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.570 
button has gone to the right right side
and<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.300> pretty<00:05:13.810> logical<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.410> have

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
and it's pretty logical to have

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.120 
and it's pretty logical to have
especially<00:05:15.580> for<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:16.060> big<00:05:16.420> phone<00:05:17.230> like<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:17.800> it

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
especially for a big phone like this it

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.970 
especially for a big phone like this it
makes<00:05:18.520> sense<00:05:18.790> to<00:05:19.000> have<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.420> on<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.440> side<00:05:20.680> and

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
makes sense to have it on this side and

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.850 
makes sense to have it on this side and
the<00:05:21.880> placement<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.300> absolutely<00:05:22.990> perfect<00:05:23.740> I

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
the placement is absolutely perfect I

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.920 
the placement is absolutely perfect I
would<00:05:24.010> say<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.430> on<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.120> left<00:05:25.360> we<00:05:25.630> have<00:05:25.660> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
would say and on the left we have the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.530 
would say and on the left we have the
volume<00:05:28.930> rocker<00:05:28.960> which<00:05:29.440> are<00:05:29.800> now<00:05:30.540> separated

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
volume rocker which are now separated

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.340 
volume rocker which are now separated
not<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:32.170> before<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.130> we<00:05:33.610> have<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:34.360> volume

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
not like before so we have the volume

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.110 
not like before so we have the volume
rocker<00:05:35.380> over<00:05:35.800> here<00:05:36.040> and<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.670> switch<00:05:37.150> key<00:05:37.560> for

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
rocker over here and the switch key for

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.700 
rocker over here and the switch key for
autorotation<00:05:40.120> lock<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:42.390> that's<00:05:43.390> about<00:05:43.750> how<00:05:44.500> it

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
autorotation lock so that's about how it

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.840 
autorotation lock so that's about how it
looks<00:05:44.920> are<00:05:45.550> the

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
looks are the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.110 
looks are the
of<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:49.110> field<00:05:49.320> is<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.980> it's<00:05:50.190> it's<00:05:50.670> aluminum

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
of the field is that it's it's aluminum

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.800 
of the field is that it's it's aluminum
but<00:05:51.390> if<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:52.260> can<00:05:52.440> hear<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.890> sound<00:05:53.810> that

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
but if you can hear the sound that

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.110 
but if you can hear the sound that
doesn't<00:05:55.170> sound<00:05:55.380> like<00:05:55.650> aluminum<00:05:56.100> so<00:05:56.280> it's<00:05:56.880> kind

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
doesn't sound like aluminum so it's kind

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.620 
doesn't sound like aluminum so it's kind
of<00:05:57.210> cheap<00:05:57.480> it's<00:05:57.720> not<00:05:57.930> something<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:59.460> own

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
of cheap it's not something that I own

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.300 
of cheap it's not something that I own
cheap<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.080> very<00:06:01.260> harsh<00:06:01.500> word<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:02.010> would<00:06:02.130> say

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
cheap is a very harsh word I would say

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.630 
cheap is a very harsh word I would say
but<00:06:02.460> it's<00:06:02.640> just<00:06:03.000> not<00:06:03.180> how<00:06:04.020> Apple<00:06:04.890> used<00:06:05.130> to<00:06:05.370> have

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
but it's just not how Apple used to have

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.760 
but it's just not how Apple used to have
are<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:06.330> iPhones<00:06:06.690> with<00:06:06.930> them<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.230> aluminum

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
are the iPhones with them the aluminum

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.540 
are the iPhones with them the aluminum
feel<00:06:08.130> and<00:06:08.430> this<00:06:09.390> sound<00:06:09.690> it's<00:06:09.980> bit<00:06:10.980> different

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
feel and this sound it's bit different

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.500 
feel and this sound it's bit different
over<00:06:12.240> here<00:06:12.270> it<00:06:12.680> doesn't<00:06:13.680> feel<00:06:14.010> of<00:06:14.340> that<00:06:15.270> bad<00:06:15.480> I

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
over here it doesn't feel of that bad I

over here it doesn't feel of that bad I
mean<00:06:15.840> it's<00:06:16.020> not<00:06:16.230> like<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.530> plastic<00:06:17.160> phone<00:06:18.260> at
