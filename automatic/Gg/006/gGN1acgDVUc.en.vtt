a kid and honestly at this point is
about<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> only<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.230> say<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
oddly enough one of them would be the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080 
oddly enough one of them would be the
shark<00:01:02.039> Takano<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.489> always<00:01:02.730> thought<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:03.059> was

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
shark Takano I always thought he was

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
actually broken one of the arms is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
actually broken one of the arms is
broken<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:08.940> I'm<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.090> blame<00:01:09.330> Billy<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
broken now I'm gonna blame Billy on that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
broken now I'm gonna blame Billy on that
actually<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> did<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> arm

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
actually because it did have the arm

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually because it did have the arm
less<00:01:11.820> than<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.119> saw<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.510> even<00:01:13.500> though<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.650> didn't

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
less than my saw it even though I didn't

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
less than my saw it even though I didn't
touch<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.549> mm-hmm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
touch the thing mm-hmm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
touch the thing mm-hmm

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that's what you say um and it is funny

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.830 
that's what you say um and it is funny
is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.850> combiners<00:01:21.450> were<00:01:21.600> some

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is a lot of the the combiners were some

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
is a lot of the the combiners were some
of<00:01:21.960> my<00:01:22.049> favorites<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.400> I'd

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
of my favorites but most of them I'd

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
of my favorites but most of them I'd
always<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> guys<00:01:25.799> I'd

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
always only get about for the guys I'd

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
always only get about for the guys I'd
never<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> fifth<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.060> sixth<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
never get that fifth or sixth one to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
never get that fifth or sixth one to
actually<00:01:28.020> complete<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> were

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
actually complete them so they were

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually complete them so they were
always<00:01:29.159> missing<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.580> arm<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> leg<00:01:29.939> or

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
always missing an arm and a leg or

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.969 
always missing an arm and a leg or
something<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.140> another<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:31.770> I'm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
something so that's another thing I'm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.670 
something so that's another thing I'm
looking<00:01:32.100> forward<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
looking forward to is actually going and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.780 
looking forward to is actually going and
you<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.710> searching<00:01:35.189> around<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> seeing<00:01:35.670> if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you know searching around and seeing if

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.800

was<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> buck<00:03:32.080> now<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> can't<00:03:33.340> say<00:03:33.459> much<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.820> had

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
was a buck now I can't say much I had

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.670 
was a buck now I can't say much I had
the<00:03:34.270> very<00:03:34.900> cobra<00:03:35.440> bass<00:03:35.940> growing<00:03:36.940> up

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the very cobra bass growing up

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.809 
the very cobra bass growing up
I<00:03:45.170> distinctly<00:03:46.170> remember<00:03:46.400> crystal<00:03:47.400> clear<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
I distinctly remember crystal clear the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.729 
I distinctly remember crystal clear the
very<00:03:48.030> first<00:03:48.269> transformer<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.900> got<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.620> was

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
very first transformer I got it was

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.259 
very first transformer I got it was
actually<00:03:50.159> this<00:03:50.280> little<00:03:50.430> guy<00:03:50.640> right<00:03:50.879> here<00:03:51.120> his

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
actually this little guy right here his

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.929 
actually this little guy right here his
name's<00:03:51.480> pipes<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:53.250> think<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.579> got<00:03:53.730> him

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
name's pipes and I think I got him

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.970 
name's pipes and I think I got him
because<00:03:54.239> he<00:03:54.510> did<00:03:54.689> turn<00:03:54.900> into<00:03:55.370> an<00:03:56.370> 18-wheeler

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
because he did turn into an 18-wheeler

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.740 
because he did turn into an 18-wheeler
rig<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.639> reminded<00:03:59.969> me<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.120> Optimus<00:04:00.480> Prime

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
rig and it reminded me of Optimus Prime

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.199 
rig and it reminded me of Optimus Prime
it<00:04:01.469> just<00:04:01.650> cost<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:02.010> whole<00:04:02.159> lot<00:04:02.219> less<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.969> I<00:04:03.000> was

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
it just cost a whole lot less so I was

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.910 
it just cost a whole lot less so I was
actually<00:04:03.389> able<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.840> get<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.439> this<00:04:04.769> was

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
actually able to get in and this was

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.979 
actually able to get in and this was
actually<00:04:05.099> on<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> trip<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.000> San<00:04:06.180> Antonio<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.840> see

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
actually on a trip to San Antonio to see

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.259 
actually on a trip to San Antonio to see
the<00:04:07.109> Alamo<00:04:07.469> for<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.709> first<00:04:07.920> time<00:04:08.159> we<00:04:08.909> stopped

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
the Alamo for the first time we stopped

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.069 
the Alamo for the first time we stopped
at<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.439> want<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> say<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.189> Kmart<00:04:11.819> if<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.209> don't<00:04:12.419> if

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
at a I want to say a Kmart if I don't if

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.890 
at a I want to say a Kmart if I don't if
I<00:04:13.230> remember<00:04:13.530> correctly<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.359> got<00:04:15.599> him

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I remember correctly and and I got him

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.300 
I remember correctly and and I got him
and<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.169> distinctly<00:04:16.530> remember<00:04:16.709> sitting<00:04:17.160> in<00:04:17.250> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
and I distinctly remember sitting in the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.680 
and I distinctly remember sitting in the
back<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.759> van<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.180> rubbing<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
back of the van and just rubbing the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.300 
back of the van and just rubbing the
little<00:04:18.930> sign<00:04:19.199> for<00:04:19.500> ever<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.859> ever<00:04:19.979> just

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
little sign for ever and ever just

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.820 
little sign for ever and ever just
looking<00:04:20.579> at<00:04:20.699> it<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> Sun<00:04:21.380> now<00:04:22.380> some<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.740> my

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
looking at it in the Sun now some of my

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.680 
looking at it in the Sun now some of my
favorite<00:04:23.220> ones<00:04:23.310> actually<00:04:23.610> uh<00:04:23.880> were<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.509> ones

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
favorite ones actually uh were the ones

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.909 
favorite ones actually uh were the ones
that<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.930> thought<00:04:25.139> were<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.590> little<00:04:25.800> bit

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
that I thought were just a little bit

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.730 
that I thought were just a little bit
clever<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.750> top<00:04:27.750> spin<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.259> twin<00:04:28.440> twist

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
clever like the top spin and twin twist

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.770 
clever like the top spin and twin twist
here<00:04:29.039> these<00:04:29.669> guys<00:04:29.970> had<00:04:30.210> very<00:04:30.419> simple

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
here these guys had very simple

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.570 
here these guys had very simple
transformations<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.039> flip<00:04:32.280> them<00:04:32.400> over

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
transformations you just flip them over

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.290 
transformations you just flip them over
and<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:34.020> rolled<00:04:34.620> them<00:04:34.770> back<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.310> they<00:04:36.210> were

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
and you rolled them back and they were

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.029 
and you rolled them back and they were
motorized<00:04:36.780> they<00:04:37.139> take<00:04:37.410> off<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.830> then<00:04:37.889> they

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
motorized they take off and then they

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.999 
motorized they take off and then they
jump<00:04:38.370> up<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.759> actually<00:04:39.360> transform<00:04:40.199> and<00:04:40.650> I

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
jump up and actually transform and I

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.320 
jump up and actually transform and I
just<00:04:41.190> thought<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.490> those<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.970> coolest

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
just thought that those the coolest

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.890 
just thought that those the coolest
thing<00:04:42.449> ever

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
thing ever

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.050 
thing ever
and<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.349> had<00:04:43.590> him<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.250> want<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.789> say<00:04:44.940> actually

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
and I had him I want to say actually

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.700 
and I had him I want to say actually
this<00:04:45.419> was<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:45.690> second<00:04:46.050> transformer<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.560> ever

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
this was the second transformer I ever

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.680 
this was the second transformer I ever
had<00:04:46.919> I<00:04:47.190> mean<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:47.880> wasn't<00:04:48.030> till<00:04:48.270> years<00:04:48.300> later

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
had I mean it wasn't till years later

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.500 
had I mean it wasn't till years later
that<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.139> was<00:04:49.260> able<00:04:49.349> to<00:04:49.500> find<00:04:49.770> him<00:04:49.979> somewhere<00:04:50.510> so

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
that I was able to find him somewhere so

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.420 
that I was able to find him somewhere so
it<00:04:52.139> was<00:04:52.260> actually<00:04:52.409> really<00:04:52.650> nice<00:04:52.949> to<00:04:53.190> get<00:04:53.280> the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
it was actually really nice to get the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.870 
it was actually really nice to get the
pair

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
pair

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.520 
pair
I<00:04:53.909> always<00:04:54.479> thought<00:04:54.659> these<00:04:54.840> guys<00:04:55.080> were<00:04:55.289> cool

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
I always thought these guys were cool

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.870 
I always thought these guys were cool
they<00:04:55.680> came<00:04:55.889> a<00:04:55.919> little<00:04:56.099> bit<00:04:56.280> later<00:04:56.520> they<00:04:56.820> were

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
they came a little bit later they were

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.170 
they came a little bit later they were
they<00:04:57.240> were<00:04:57.330> twins<00:04:58.070> they<00:04:59.070> looked<00:04:59.340> pretty<00:04:59.580> much

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
they were twins they looked pretty much

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.820 
they were twins they looked pretty much
identical<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.720> robot<00:05:01.020> form<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.620> would

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
identical in robot form but they would

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.379 
identical in robot form but they would
transform<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.370> in<00:05:02.699> two<00:05:02.789> different<00:05:03.120> things<00:05:03.270> one

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
transform it in two different things one

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.860 
transform it in two different things one
was<00:05:03.659> a<00:05:03.720> speedster<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:05.099> other<00:05:05.220> was<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.870> an

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
was a speedster the other was a an

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.749 
was a speedster the other was a an
airplane<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.440> some<00:05:07.650> sort<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:07.979> futuristic<00:05:08.310> Arab

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
airplane to some sort of futuristic Arab

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.240 
airplane to some sort of futuristic Arab
airplane<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.830> thought<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:10.979> was<00:05:11.220> a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
airplane and I just thought that was a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.520 
airplane and I just thought that was a
clever<00:05:11.550> idea<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:12.289> was<00:05:13.289> always<00:05:13.470> fond<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:14.220> the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
clever idea I was always fond of the

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.920 
clever idea I was always fond of the
miniature<00:05:16.530> ones<00:05:16.800> like<00:05:17.389> Beachcomber<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:18.720> sea

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
miniature ones like Beachcomber and sea

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.800 
miniature ones like Beachcomber and sea
spray<00:05:19.349> and<00:05:19.740> power<00:05:20.639> glide<00:05:21.000> here<00:05:21.360> these<00:05:21.509> guys<00:05:21.780> I

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
spray and power glide here these guys I
