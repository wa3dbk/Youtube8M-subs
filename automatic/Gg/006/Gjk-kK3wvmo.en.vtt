instill some good habits from the get-go
on<00:02:26.239> this<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:27.110> example

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
on this for example

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.320 
on this for example
pick<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.220> down<00:02:28.519> down<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:30.790> okay<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.060> reason

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
pick it down down down okay the reason

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.750 
pick it down down down okay the reason
I'm<00:02:32.450> saying<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.750> briefly<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.670> picking<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
I'm saying that briefly is picking the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.100 
I'm saying that briefly is picking the
direction<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.360> next<00:02:35.510> string<00:02:35.900> that's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
direction of the next string that's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.229 
direction of the next string that's
coming<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.160> that's<00:02:37.459> not<00:02:37.610> always<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.209> case

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
coming up and that's not always the case

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.930 
coming up and that's not always the case
but<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.690> usually<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.260> okay<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.100> then<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.579> then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
but it usually is okay and then and then

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.340 
but it usually is okay and then and then
our<00:02:41.030> next<00:02:41.150> string<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> string<00:02:41.840> so

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
our next string is the a string so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
our next string is the a string so
that's<00:02:42.440> why<00:02:42.620> I'm<00:02:42.739> saying<00:02:42.920> pick<00:02:43.100> up<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> G

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
that's why I'm saying pick up on the G

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.750 
that's why I'm saying pick up on the G
okay<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.980> 2<00:02:49.160> chord

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
okay and then we go to a a a 2 chord

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.680 
okay and then we go to a a a 2 chord
first<00:02:50.450> finger<00:02:50.810> 2<00:02:51.019> D<00:02:51.260> middle<00:02:51.829> finger<00:02:52.070> 2<00:02:52.250> g's<00:02:52.519> and
