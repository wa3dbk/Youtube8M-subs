00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.710
 good ya have your ipad ipad again 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.330
 an apple product is a tablet that 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 it will be a delight to teach 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 to take your contacts to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.560
 make videoconference for a million 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 things that you will be able to use well 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.999
 on the ipad the first thing we have to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.349
 know is that it has two buttons very 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.679
 important the most important 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.850
 possibly this is the button that 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.859
 start the button that is in the interface 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.929
 on the screen the ipad screen and 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.390
 then this other also very important 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.910
 that is up is the button 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.489
 suspension the button that when we give it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.609
 already stops using the battery because 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.859
 we see that it goes black we give it to the 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.629
 button above we see it here and 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.480
 it automatically no longer consumes energy 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.760
 all right 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.180
 if we do not want to put back 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 we just give the start button and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
 we see how good I here I have it with 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.780
 a password as it is already put again 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 in operation therefore the button 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.860
 of suspension that is this above and the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.950
 start button that we said is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.090
 this well as we turn it off good there are two 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
 ways to turn it off 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.250
 one is keeping the button that we see 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.060
 up here but I'm going to advise you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 because the stable ones have sometimes given 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.360
 problems 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.610
 they turn off so they can have a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.000
 excellent battery charge is better 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.670
 turn off those in this other way is giving 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.580
 at the same time and keeping the two buttons to 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.580
 the button is the start button 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.250
 front of the ipad and this other the two to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.620
 the time and we're going to see how it turns off 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 there are two ways if we give both 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.909
 buttons at the same time we will keep it and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 instead of giving 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:04.820
 and we wait until it's already turned off 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.179
 it's that easy and we have turned off the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.860
 then to put it back in 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.770
 operation we're just going to give 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.569
 click and we'll put it back in 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.310
 functioning 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.659
 another very important thing to have in 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 account after we have learned to 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.030
 turn it off and turn it on is that he 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.819
 tablet the ipad has to be carried to the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.799
 force please because someday it will 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.170
 can fall can be easily broken 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.019
 you have to carry a cover you have to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.200
 carry in a kind of housing either 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.540
 metal or of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.310
 or any other product in this case 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.640
 leather to protect it the iPad what 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.280
 let's put in the case and its 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.410
 corners are going to be protected 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 let's put it here for us to see 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.650
 we put it in this simple case and now 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.739
 We can go more safely with our 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.810
 device because sooner or later we will 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.920
 will fall then it will be protected 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:16.640
 with a housing and any of the 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.730
 covers can be worth as long as they are 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.020
 well protected the corners otherwise 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.360
 important also is that we have to 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.459
 bring a cloth to every once in a while 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.950
 how are we going to use the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:34.280
 finger cleaning the screen of 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.790
 our ipad well this is 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.600
 just the beginning congratulations we have 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.330
 learned to turn on the ipad turn off the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.950
 ipad and know that two very elements 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.010
 important that are the varienta for 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.799
 clean it and the metal leather housing 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 to protect it and take it like a book 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.180
 more like any other book
