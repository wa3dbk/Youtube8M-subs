00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello everyone today video speech 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 Will go about catrice browser in shade 030 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.889
 called medium bronze and now i'm 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.049
 I will tell you in detail about him so when I 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.080
 I saw just such a box and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 I saw the shade of the browser itself, I honestly 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 mention was in some perplexity Well 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.430
 I've met such shades 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.619
 the tincture is so small that I just 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.349
 grabbed this bronzer from the shelf and ran 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 home rather try it shade 030 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 as I said 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.370
 he is absolutely not red I think this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 Bronzer and blondes fit and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 brunettes and lighter skin and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 slightly darker girls I now compare 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 him with my favorite pink clinics and in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 unlike him he has no 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 sequin no chimera 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.280
 is absolute matte without 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.620
 any hint of vrazhin that quite 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.530
 for some kind of corrective powder 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 corrective bronzer a perfect 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.260
 option so let me compare this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 tint catrice with a touch of my 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.159
 beloved bronzer 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.570
 true he has such small sparkles 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.330
 and see how he probably 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.240
 color is more ideal for contouring and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 for face correction unlike browser 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.079
 clinics are completely matt and not even 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.540
 red although in principle the bronzer of the clinics is not 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.590
 redhead now I'll try with one hand 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 still open the dior bronzer and let's 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 compare three colors from all three colors 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 the least red one is this bronzer 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 catrice i think you are very good 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 visible and you can compare well now 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 let's dwell on 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 as it is very soft 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.360
 very nice applied to the face and now 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 I will try to demonstrate it to you 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.210
 without any stains without any 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.119
 problems and creates such a very, very 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.030
 easy if you need to cover it and if 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.160
 you layered and then it will be enough 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.120
 noticeably look on the face look 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:28.540
 what a wonderful shadow he gives 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:32.190
 natural lack of glitter composition 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.569
 Bronzer plays us only on hand 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.940
 sculpture nothing will 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.760
 shine and will be created exactly 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.940
 This effect is natural in the plugin 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.459
 for example on the cheekbones and let me on the other 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.290
 I will put the sides 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.290
 Bronzer, here is the firm clinic 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.610
 you know the price they certainly different 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.910
 but to me in color even though 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.580
 clinics is a rose romance gravedigger 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.760
 20 years, I much prefer 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.710
 bronzer catrice and lately i'm im 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.800
 I actively use this from me 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.140
 effect like more than say 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.320
 Olya Ryzhiki 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.860
 giving olimik quality no me 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.650
 claims no light just gorgeous 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.600
 in general from this browser and its price 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.500
 fairly affordable enough 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.820
 budget in general, I am delighted and 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.200
 I can advise you 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.080
 also this bronzers have a tint slightly 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.900
 a little later i'm this shade me 30 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.880
 I like it a lot more 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 I can advise and recommend 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.920
 let's smile closer 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.460
 when drying was watched absolute 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.150
 matt very soft very velvety 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.360
 silky product that looks like this 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.530
 so here are no blemishes on my face like I already 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.690
 said very naturally and naturally and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.980
 such coverage and density 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.650
 He, too, does not give therefore pour on the face 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.270
 insanely natural and cool i hope 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.250
 that this video was useful to you 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.940
