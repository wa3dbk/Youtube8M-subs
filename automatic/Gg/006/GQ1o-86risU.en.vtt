00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
that sixty thousand maybe I think it i'd

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
that sixty thousand maybe I think it i'd
go<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:22.890> philly<00:00:23.340> base<00:00:23.550> Santana<00:00:23.880> instead

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
go for philly base Santana instead

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
go for philly base Santana instead
because<00:00:25.199> I've<00:00:25.410> uses<00:00:25.800> normal<00:00:26.039> color<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.430> an

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
because I've uses normal color for an

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.550 
because I've uses normal color for an
absolute<00:00:27.000> beast<00:00:27.240> he's<00:00:27.539> got<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> pace

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
absolute beast he's got a lot of pace

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259 
absolute beast he's got a lot of pace
really<00:00:29.099> good<00:00:29.250> shooting<00:00:29.519> stance<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:29.880> well<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
very solid heading and defending so I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
very solid heading and defending so I
think<00:00:32.309> I'd<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.700> over<00:00:32.759> him<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.120> pricing

think I'd go over him because pricing

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.720 
think I'd go over him because pricing
very<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.530> good<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> stats<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.309> his<00:00:35.489> card

couple<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> good<00:00:46.320> plays<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.710> he's<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
couple of good plays now he's got a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
couple of good plays now he's got a
random<00:00:47.789> centre-back<00:00:48.450> unscented<00:00:49.020> fielded

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
random centre-back unscented fielded

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.630 
random centre-back unscented fielded
kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> ruining<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> chemistry<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.520> mean

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
kind of ruining the chemistry I mean

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.979 
kind of ruining the chemistry I mean
they've<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> link<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> each<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> think

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they've got a link of each other I think

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.060 
they've got a link of each other I think
maybe<00:00:52.110> he<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.350> building<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> team<00:00:52.949> from

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
maybe he was building up the team from

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
maybe he was building up the team from
scratch<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.969> mean<00:00:54.360> those<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.629> only

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
scratch and I mean those are the only

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.450 
scratch and I mean those are the only
two<00:00:54.899> positions<00:00:55.260> he<00:00:55.350> hasn't<00:00:55.739> filled<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> yes<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
two positions he hasn't filled in yes I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
two positions he hasn't filled in yes I
Oh<00:00:56.789> yet<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.600> guess<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.590> through<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.160> go

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
Oh yet I guess but we go through to go

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
Oh yet I guess but we go through to go
out<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> lead<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.480> 13th<00:01:00.930> minute

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
out and take the lead in the 13th minute

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
out and take the lead in the 13th minute
quite<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> nice<00:01:01.829> girl<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> did<00:01:02.250> quite<00:01:02.430> well<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
quite a nice girl you did quite well to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.340 
quite a nice girl you did quite well to
hold<00:01:02.940> us<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> defender<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:03.989> surprised

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hold us a defender quite surprised

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.810 
hold us a defender quite surprised
because<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:05.040> hasn't<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> best<00:01:05.580> strength

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
because he hasn't got the best strength

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
because he hasn't got the best strength
in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> world<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.409> still<00:01:07.470> doing

very good place to keep her frozen out

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
very good place to keep her frozen out
and<00:01:27.210> uh<00:01:27.390> he's<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> board<00:01:28.799> smashes

and uh he's there on the board smashes
it<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> he's<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> lot<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> power<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.229> his

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it in he's got a lot of power on his

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
it in he's got a lot of power on his
shots<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> best

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
shots which is you know one of the best

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.819 
shots which is you know one of the best
things<00:01:33.600> about<00:01:33.780> him<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.079> he's<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> good<00:01:34.619> for

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
things about him and he's got a good for

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.380 
things about him and he's got a good for
natural<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.400> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> his<00:01:35.759> troublin

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
natural it's just kind of his troublin

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
natural it's just kind of his troublin
is<00:01:36.600> drooling<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.320> closer<00:01:37.650> quite<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is drooling is closer quite good but I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
is drooling is closer quite good but I
guess<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.509> moving<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> board<00:01:40.290> control

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guess it's moving more the board control

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
guess it's moving more the board control
when<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> ball<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> him<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.820> his<00:01:41.850> feet

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
when you get the ball to him in his feet

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580 
when you get the ball to him in his feet
and<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> ball<00:01:43.560> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and if you kind of like got the ball in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
and if you kind of like got the ball in
a<00:01:43.950> closed<00:01:44.189> area<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> couple<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> other

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a closed area with a couple of other

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.359 
a closed area with a couple of other
players<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.409> hard<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> do

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
players it's just really hard to do

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
players it's just really hard to do
anything<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.030> him<00:01:48.149> he<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.299> seems<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
anything with him he just seems to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.050 
anything with him he just seems to
always<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.200> tackled<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.850> annoying

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
always get tackled it's very annoying

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
always get tackled it's very annoying
when<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.509> close<00:01:51.720> quarters<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.110> him

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
when you're in close quarters with him

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620 
when you're in close quarters with him
but<00:01:52.729> feel<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> very<00:01:53.880> such<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> strike<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
but feel a very such a strike at the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.450 
but feel a very such a strike at the
moment<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> might<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> try<00:01:55.590> out<00:01:55.740> bury<00:01:56.070> us<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
moment I might have to try out bury us I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.819 
moment I might have to try out bury us I
think<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.240> infomercial<00:01:58.229> Dortmund

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
think is the other infomercial Dortmund

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.139 
think is the other infomercial Dortmund
stroke<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.490> he's<00:01:59.579> nothing<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
stroke I think he's nothing like the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.789 
stroke I think he's nothing like the
Chinese<00:02:00.390> league<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> give<00:02:01.590> him<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
Chinese league so I have to give him a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.090 
Chinese league so I have to give him a
go<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.549> point<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.829> okazaki<00:02:04.829> Xin

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
go at some point because okazaki Xin

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
go at some point because okazaki Xin
form<00:02:05.369> there's<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.790> even<00:02:05.850> any<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> market

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
form there's not even any on the market

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.789 
form there's not even any on the market
i<00:02:06.780> had<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> look<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.170> early<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.770> like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
i had to look at early just see like

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
i had to look at early just see like
what<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> price<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> him<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> there's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
what the price was of him and there's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.029 
what the price was of him and there's
not<00:02:09.390> even<00:02:09.420> any<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> market<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.709> I'm

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
not even any on the market so I'm

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.320 
not even any on the market so I'm
guessing<00:02:11.489> he's<00:02:11.730> quite<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:12.000> old<00:02:12.090> informant

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
guessing he's quite an old informant

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.490 
guessing he's quite an old informant
very<00:02:12.720> rare<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.170> we

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
very rare but we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
very rare but we
schmotzer<00:02:14.010> don't<00:02:14.940> open<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> rock<00:02:15.450> formation

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
schmotzer don't open the rock formation

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.360 
schmotzer don't open the rock formation
because<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.410> lot<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.620> bushard

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
because it's got a lot of bushard

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.770 
because it's got a lot of bushard
ortmann<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.910> german<00:02:18.240> like<00:02:18.360> surrounding<00:02:18.690> me

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
ortmann and german like surrounding me

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
ortmann and german like surrounding me
just<00:02:18.960> get<00:02:19.110> 9<00:02:19.260> chemistry<00:02:19.680> nevertheless<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
just get 9 chemistry nevertheless and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
just get 9 chemistry nevertheless and
that<00:02:20.340> does<00:02:20.610> give<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.970> flea<00:02:21.630> bass<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.960> town<00:02:22.170> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that does give a flea bass on town of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.170 
that does give a flea bass on town of
the<00:02:22.380> full<00:02:22.590> nine<00:02:23.010> chemistry<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.700> well<00:02:23.970> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the full nine chemistry as well so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
the full nine chemistry as well so
that's<00:02:24.300> quite<00:02:24.720> good<00:02:24.750> for<00:02:24.960> our<00:02:25.080> defense<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.440> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that's quite good for our defense so I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.300 
that's quite good for our defense so I
think<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.710> only<00:02:25.800> player<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.160> online

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
think the only player not online

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.340 
think the only player not online
chemistry<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.850> moment<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.180> era<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.170> will

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
chemistry the moment is era and will

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.870 
chemistry the moment is era and will
hopefully<00:02:28.440> saw<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:28.980> very<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.310> soon<00:02:29.490> as

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
hopefully saw that out very very soon as

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.550 
hopefully saw that out very very soon as

probably next episode I want to try that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.060 
probably next episode I want to try that

which is so you don't really see that

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.560 
which is so you don't really see that

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.320 
leave a comment guys let me know she
think<00:06:08.370> I<00:06:08.430> should<00:06:08.580> go<00:06:08.729> in<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.000> play<00:06:09.270> some

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
think I should go in and play some

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.120 
think I should go in and play some
tournaments<00:06:10.110> because<00:06:10.169> i<00:06:10.410> did<00:06:10.620> get<00:06:10.710> angry<00:06:10.979> last

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
tournaments because i did get angry last

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.560 
tournaments because i did get angry last
time<00:06:11.310> but<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.520> mean<00:06:11.669> plan<00:06:11.849> against<00:06:12.090> these

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
time but I mean plan against these

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.270 
time but I mean plan against these
normal<00:06:13.050> players<00:06:13.260> can<00:06:13.590> get<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.770> bit<00:06:13.889> poor<00:06:14.160> and

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
normal players can get a bit poor and

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.219 
normal players can get a bit poor and
eventually<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.669> have<00:06:14.880> won<00:06:15.120> six<00:06:15.419> games<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:15.960> row

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
eventually I have won six games in row

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.650 
eventually I have won six games in row
at<00:06:16.530> least<00:06:16.800> now<00:06:17.039> so<00:06:17.370> obviously<00:06:18.300> i<00:06:18.389> think<00:06:18.570> we're

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
at least now so obviously i think we're

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.180 
at least now so obviously i think we're
probably<00:06:18.690> good<00:06:19.139> enough<00:06:19.260> to<00:06:19.470> do<00:06:19.680> it<00:06:19.800> but<00:06:19.979> um

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
probably good enough to do it but um

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.350 
probably good enough to do it but um
that's<00:06:20.729> going<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:20.970> be<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.120> end<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.270> the
