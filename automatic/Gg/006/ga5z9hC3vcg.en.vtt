 serious and two success including a yes 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.340
 famous ship

 is gorssel jacobsz 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 I know that for a while yes as if 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 good sup pillar is all this though 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 all youtubers what I came 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.610
 accidentally to who may of course 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.940
 or join in is really fun 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.940
 of course 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.149
 so it was all very cozy afternoon now 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 I also got a ball 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.899
 only yes and with the year so that you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.690
 so of course but and this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 is also a game-play routine 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.510
 clearly visible but you can already see it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.299
 I use a predator and I went baby 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 for for sometime for around a cape 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.150
 little is relaxed Game is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.369
 indeed just if you have a sphere with sand 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.330
 plays or even with a track for example 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.330
 at the en mary then 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 but i'm playing with you talking 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 Missal and the aspiring Beverlo 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 and you had this game play 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.689
 really very clear notice is that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
 asphalt 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.810
 mega about paul heart is like it isn't 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 Stashed school was warm 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 because here I just have the muscle in that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 just that i want against who plays sorry 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 maybe you will say there they were 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.750
 here not good and not too bad so I 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.649
 say a lot just taste their share 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.149
 i just go very easy with one 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.530
 pallet I can do a triple kill half past twelve 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.110
 double kill and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.900
 and we aim their kilt quite a lot and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.890
 p flea kill very much yes then you are already going 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.720
 very hard of course if you have a little bit 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.430
 pay attention all over for the duration of 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.400
 the game play the souls 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.460
 gameplay of just under 8 minutes 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.080
 alongside with intro 'along with everything on it and 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.580
 is exactly 7 minutes and 40 seconds 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.260
 so shopping without the intro is real 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 pure it a time so yes people that whole 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.740
 mind natural 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.560
 pastors a match in 7 minutes and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.510
 Win 40 seconds 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 yes that is quite a bit of course because yes 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.860
 we just did that 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.970
 just to have it swept away actually 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.180
 often a pastor and a game i have i make 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.550
 I think when I finally count it 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.580
 maybe only 2000 will be on 22 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.070
 google them so in role half less than 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.380
 I think half of van 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.950
 from the piles of kills that I ended up with 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.780
 got what eventually got 51 kills and 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.049
 then you think to yourself after all 51 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.120
 Kielhl's that you did with such a thing anyway 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.980
 say something in the only 7 half minutes 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.380
 more well that's fine nothing wrong with that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.570
 but you already see it is a répète it is 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.130
 a very interesting gameplay 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.810
 We already look at Dick's what 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.330
 fuck man you just got it 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.310
 started 51 the four I finally had or 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.299
 so bad fine that who's top of the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.340
 ratio 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.380
 everything good tasty I had a lot of point 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.320
 indeed also on personal capture 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.580
 yes i was really 2000 points and phoebe 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.820
 even in the lobby 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.470
 and that is really a lot but yes that yes 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.560
 the appearance is deceiving in the dan 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.180
 because i thought i was on a mole 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.250
 strings zaltbommel zaltbommel just go 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.600
 actually the basis is but trap was 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.330
 framed wall holder thus back to back 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.230
 b flow and that usually you have all the kills 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.230
 but unfortunately it wasn't 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.550
 if about indeed have been overpowed 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.260
 but I know that I or whine so 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.230
 when I started the game from 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.450
 of formulating everything against it 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.920
 bladiebladiebla 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.390
 when you go see how i look at this 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.980
 game peanut think well actually 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.090
 it is sometimes good that it becomes 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.280
 shot or 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.120
 yes I just didn't get up and down 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 Well now the Aygo is a bit with every one 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.010
 call of duty, there is no problem 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.860
 that killstreaks of course just whole 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.860
 very decisive for a competition and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.950
 we stuff corn flakes together as a group 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.420
 sometimes with 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.740
 with grandma with only specialists 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.200
 and you even see it a bit 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.120
 say irritate that areas with 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.680
 special is playing because what goes then 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.720
 to happen 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.490
 everyone is on level streak they had 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.520
 here from bow tie 5 7 11 what happens 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.170
 then to which people go new capture 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.370
 whatever happens then we do too 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.830
 lose a game very often 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.670
 so actually yes what I do with this like this 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.100
 bomb 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.910
 giving is actually from journal in 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.100
 it and partners are full of party 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.260
 does not all play miss fashion because 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.910
 because you go you go with a bollards 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.350
 handy and ultimately because home belgium 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.450
 for that triple Carmelite tripel 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.430
 campers apr to good trash the whole 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.460
 game started to just be a big one 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.260
 that 's just the way it actually is so I have 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.020
 tipping of give to you you 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.670
 to do so shallow microphone party 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.520
 everyone specially playing 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.550
 just that there has always been someone how 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.870
 on the sports field or someone with with 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.010
 plays as lunch 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.720
 do not necessarily have to be highly reese 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.300
 also layer it just from your video 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.650
 present michel helicopter it 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.750
 actually just enough of a joke 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.000
 what policy namely off because they are 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.890
 nevertheless the opponent are busy anyway 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.950
 shooting a 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.479
 or helicopter and just make sure you 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.790
 just yes 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.200
 the team that play asphalt and sport 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.800
 they are probably also going to school 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.030
 easy apps you have a point 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.880
 yeah so just the tip I do here 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.740
 I let that pass with you 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.130
 fairly useful tip is so leave me 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.900
 to hear 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.070
 raid if it works a bit i would 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.820
 say let it so i hear it 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.780
 nice peaks to know if it works 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.000
 I also play perfectly to his files 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.040
 his work and I will not continue there either 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.570
 so tell me i can still say 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.370
 that I deliberately matchgraph I play 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.840
 I order colossus chain and 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.700
 In addition, I am green with mercury brawl 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.040
 and the stick already so you can handle it hard 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.350
 but yes on a high 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.700
 if you play higher bow what makes it 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.340
 then from that one time that often to no 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.710
 so much from maybe risky scrub that 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.960
 might have something extra 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.520
 can bring 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.250
 but enough about gameplay because it is already 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.169
 almost the end again with day after then 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.440
 nice to have some tips from me 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.440
 to give 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.550
 we are talking about is tomorrow 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.160
 frieze follow upload I don't see that 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.870
 everyone that looks more say yesterday 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.330
 about which brand you a little 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.380
 has this super fun to do so 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.560
 that does not matter but I want 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.950
 well that in there asked for yes god one 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.150
 let ask for a pure no me 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.380
 going to do it soon 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.860
 And yes I want to ask you if you now have one 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.720
 asked later to behind me 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.390
 I mainly fish at the gp van 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.490
 and then you go as good they put in it 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.640
 weekend Sunday or Monday then 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.990
 is that online renting no, I hope so 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.300
 that you still play the game anyway 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.560
 it enjoyed 50 kills plus 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.770
 twelve 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.090
 but whether it is beautiful do not know to the 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.090
 next time bye bye
