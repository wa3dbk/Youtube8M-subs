00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
thereof in fat loss diets but let's take

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.490 
thereof in fat loss diets but let's take
a<00:01:01.649> broader<00:01:02.180> approach<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.820> consider

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
a broader approach and consider

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
a broader approach and consider
potentially<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.979> poor<00:01:08.549> young<00:01:08.580> lady

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
potentially why this poor young lady

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.429 
potentially why this poor young lady
I<00:01:09.240> mean<00:01:09.420> dying<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.840> 25<00:01:10.320> years<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> age<00:01:12.439> might

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I mean dying at 25 years of age might

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.690 
I mean dying at 25 years of age might
have<00:01:13.619> passed<00:01:13.890> away<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.720> how<00:01:15.720> juice<00:01:15.990> fasts

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
have passed away and how juice fasts

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.640 
have passed away and how juice fasts
might<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.970> exacerbated<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.170> problem<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
might have exacerbated the problem I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
might have exacerbated the problem I
really<00:01:19.890> wouldn't<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.400> surprised<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> say<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
really wouldn't go surprised to say that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560 
really wouldn't go surprised to say that
a<00:01:21.659> juice<00:01:21.869> fast<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.470> kill<00:01:22.710> somebody<00:01:23.570> my

let's<00:04:00.989> talk<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.739> simple<00:04:01.980> language<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.280> slows

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
let's talk in simple language it slows

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.250 
let's talk in simple language it slows
down<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.880> absorption<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.420> sugar<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.200> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
down the absorption of the sugar so it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.229 
down the absorption of the sugar so it
prevents<00:04:04.650> blood<00:04:05.310> sugar<00:04:05.519> spikes<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.120> what

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
prevents blood sugar spikes this is what

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.840 
prevents blood sugar spikes this is what
you<00:04:06.299> want<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.630> what<00:04:06.780> keeps<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.670> this<00:04:08.670> is

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
you want this is what keeps you this is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.180 
you want this is what keeps you this is
what<00:04:09.000> keeps<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.359> healthy<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:10.799> notion<00:04:11.040> of

what keeps you healthy this notion of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.800 
what keeps you healthy this notion of

will start to down-regulate so over time

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.570 
will start to down-regulate so over time
you<00:04:30.120> will<00:04:30.450> need<00:04:30.660> fewer<00:04:31.050> calories<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:32.040> maintain

you need time I don't necessarily back
to<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.190> concept<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.640> metabolic<00:04:42.060> damage<00:04:42.210> but

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
to this concept of metabolic damage but

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.480 
to this concept of metabolic damage but
it's<00:04:42.960> short-term<00:04:43.350> mental<00:04:43.710> damage<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.220> sure

it's short-term mental damage for sure

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.280 
it's short-term mental damage for sure
and<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.060> need<00:04:45.270> time<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.600> coax<00:04:45.960> your

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
and you need time to coax your

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.950 
and you need time to coax your
metabolism<00:04:46.830> back<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:48.270> where<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.570> should<00:04:48.630> have

metabolism back to where it should have
