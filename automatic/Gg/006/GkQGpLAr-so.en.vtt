00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello rone cold light sport 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 third part of our work on the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.230
 crowd and how to make it more efficient 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.410
 and economic 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.490
 we will see today 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.850
 the importance of laying the foot on the ground 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 in the other race 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.789
 take two people of the same corpulence 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 same size of one time try to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.119
 understand why one current 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.699
 acquired to their will make less noise 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.730
 by contacting the ground that the other you go 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.820
 run a speed - three in ten years 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 yet nobody for investigation to their 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 generality strong to lead to the ground 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.940
 should necessarily generate more shock 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
 normally not more noise 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 contacting the care every time he 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.920
 pose the foot yet it is not the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 case it is once and we can observe it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550
 especially with the best ones actually 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 who runs very fast mental schemas by 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.539
 example for the mans at 1-1 turns and in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 2:02 we have to look at the economy of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 repress and especially the noise that make 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 these people in contact are not everything 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 simply serve as the alignment of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 their bodies and especially segments of the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 foot of the waist and brass one goes 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.159
 see now together 1st disappears 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 to better understand this point thank you this 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.920
 which is very simple is to use in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 state of sports and who the jump rope 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.020
 to all of us here we are together 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.530
 now with this famous one we're going 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.540
 jump have defeated both phases and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.759
 necessarily show you a phase 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.220
 I'll willingly friendships 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.259
 my hips and shoulders for 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.670
 shows how much I pay reshuffle 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.409
 so is I contact the ground with 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.299
 a lot more speed by losing 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.680
 amount of suspension and a second 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.689
 phase where I voluntarily remained 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.310
 to rule with my feet my hips and my 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.299
 shoulders to show how much I 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.970
 wins a time of suspension 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.619
 I know the jump with a lot more 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 milk I admit I do not care easy departure 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.240
 50 at supper and another after the dead 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.009
 with thanks again to jump to is 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.179
 what it gives I'll hear it 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.590
 animated foot compared to the game by 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.970
 imbalances stamp of a crutch 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.009
 when I find where I edit the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.729
 soil and I touch soul is a lot 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.530
 more power 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.000
 I would have done the same thing with a 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.410
 back side that the feet is the front 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.900
 or the back of the body is the same 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.160
 thing I return every time when he 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.640
 was very attractive to the person 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
 quickly 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 now i show cgc koala a it's 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.150
 to stay perfectly well 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.730
 notice so notice the time of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.239
 suspension that I can benefit because I 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.760
 keep your feet 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.159
 under the hips and my shoulders and so 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.780
 behind the flexibility that I have when I 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.670
 contact the only one it is very important to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.409
 keep these points there to be able when 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.849
 you accelerate beware of more than 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.440
 power and our situation a little 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.540
 higher but what you contact the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.950
 balance do not crush you do not lose 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.750
 energy and especially protect in 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.819
 situation and your music of you 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.200
 expose my muscle less contact this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.920
 that you knew for that to be 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.450
 able to hold not an event a 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.700
 cited one of them important since 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.870
 you're tired the loans now the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.609
 put into practice in the agreement jumped 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.870
 we will go directly free it is 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.769
 the agreement jumped with what they 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.540
 call a double honor 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.150
 the motive and pass twice the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.769
 skipping rope under my feet 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.209
 there are six precisely needs to have 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.730
 heard relatively long station 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.829
 here we simply put the principle 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.629
 three segments align hip foot 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.500
 shoulders to be able to exist only at six 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.500
 month above 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.020
 from heaven where I keep foot hips and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:46.930
 allied shoulders and here is the version I 'm 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:49.060
 undress and therefore still mark 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.680
 animals in fact that feet quickly 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.600
 trains me in the ground a lot more 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.580
 fast and noting in exercise have the double 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.320
 I am forced to generics a lot 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.630
 more speed segment of the water body 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.190
 remain in suspension and that's 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.800
 work it's one of those movements there 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.810
 be it a rope on happiness the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.310
 simple jump or possibly his part a 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.320
 jumped on classic vertical seals 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.930
 to feel and understand a little 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.040
 little this alignment of the feet with the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.040
 hips and with shoulders
