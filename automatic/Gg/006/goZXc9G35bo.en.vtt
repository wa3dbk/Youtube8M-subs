00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
slowly slowly do it outside because
whenever<00:00:30.570> possible<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.920> wind<00:00:32.099> can

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
whenever possible because the wind can

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
whenever possible because the wind can
pick<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.940> opposed<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> inside<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
pick it up as opposed to inside and you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.389 
pick it up as opposed to inside and you
have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.040> spring

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
have to be so this is just the spring

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
have to be so this is just the spring
cleanup<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> couple<00:00:42.360> months

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
cleanup it's been a couple months

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.100 
cleanup it's been a couple months
actually<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.800> let<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> hair<00:00:44.370> grow<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.110> while

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
actually we let the hair grow a while

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually we let the hair grow a while
and<00:00:46.440> that's<00:00:46.530> actually<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.399> like

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and that's actually one thing I like

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.709 
and that's actually one thing I like
about<00:00:47.610> doing<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> hair<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.450> bit

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
about doing the hair a little bit

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
about doing the hair a little bit
shorter<00:00:49.289> than<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.340> wish<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.579> time<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
shorter than you might wish it time is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
shorter than you might wish it time is
then<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> gets<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.500> longer<00:00:53.030> has

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
then it gets a little bit longer has

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
then it gets a little bit longer has
that<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.629> don't<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.199> cut<00:00:55.379> as

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that they don't have to be cut as

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
that they don't have to be cut as
frequently<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.960> almost<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.300> long

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
frequently so it's almost like a long

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
frequently so it's almost like a long
buzz<00:01:00.629> cut<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.100> let<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.460> grow<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
buzz cut and then you let them grow it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.469 
buzz cut and then you let them grow it
down<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> bit<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:05.880> how<00:01:06.030> long<00:01:06.240> how

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
down a bit so you can see how long how

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
down a bit so you can see how long how
much<00:01:06.600> hairs<00:01:06.869> coming<00:01:07.229> off<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.260> a
