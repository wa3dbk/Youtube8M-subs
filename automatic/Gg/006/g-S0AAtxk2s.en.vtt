00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.649 

put<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:35.549> piece<00:01:36.549> of<00:01:36.850> your<00:01:37.060> construction<00:01:37.509> block

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
put a piece of your construction block

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.419 
put a piece of your construction block
over<00:01:37.869> there<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:39.009> over<00:01:39.159> there<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.950> take<00:01:42.159> a

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
over there and over there now you take a

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.859 
over there and over there now you take a
redstone<00:01:42.909> repeater<00:01:44.069> put<00:01:45.069> one<00:01:45.250> there<00:01:45.869> just

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
redstone repeater put one there just

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.539 
redstone repeater put one there just
beyond<00:01:47.140> this<00:01:47.740> block<00:01:47.979> right<00:01:48.009> here<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:51.340> put

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
beyond this block right here you put

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:59.490 
beyond this block right here you put
another<00:01:51.909> one<00:01:52.119> on<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:52.810> blog

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.810 

ah<00:01:59.730> glitch

alright

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:21.700 
alright
take<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.470> piston<00:02:06.830> their<00:02:08.680> piston<00:02:09.680> over<00:02:09.830> there

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

alrighty<00:02:22.710> then

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.979 

now<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:27.050> will<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.319> powered<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.480> we'll<00:02:29.900> get

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
now that will be powered and we'll get

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.789 
now that will be powered and we'll get
to<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.140> part<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.930> get<00:02:33.110> down<00:02:33.409> that

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
to that part now when that get down that

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.710 
to that part now when that get down that
gets<00:02:33.950> power<00:02:35.470> real<00:02:36.470> power<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.799> this<00:02:36.890> block

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
gets power real power of this block

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.890 
gets power real power of this block
causing<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:39.260> redstone<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.129> be<00:02:40.250> turned<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.900> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
causing this redstone to be turned on to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.680 
causing this redstone to be turned on to
push<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:43.420> piston<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:45.019> push<00:02:45.200> over<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
push this piston to push over now you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.890 
push this piston to push over now you
can't<00:02:47.930> put<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:49.150> can't<00:02:50.150> put<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:50.629> part

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
can't put it there can't put this part

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
can't put it there can't put this part
over<00:02:51.019> here<00:02:51.260> over<00:02:51.440> here<00:02:51.620> because<00:02:52.129> you<00:02:52.879> cannot

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
over here over here because you cannot

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.630 
over here over here because you cannot
power<00:02:53.480> glowstone<00:02:54.019> which<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.500> utterly<00:02:55.370> stupid

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
power glowstone which is utterly stupid

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.900 
power glowstone which is utterly stupid
I<00:02:56.000> don't<00:02:56.540> know<00:02:56.629> why<00:02:56.810> but<00:03:01.989> there<00:03:02.989> we<00:03:03.319> go<00:03:03.910> now

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
I don't know why but there we go now

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.479 
I don't know why but there we go now
that<00:03:04.970> will<00:03:05.150> push<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.690> block<00:03:05.930> over<00:03:06.170> there

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
that will push that block over there

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.670 
that will push that block over there
causing<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.660> have<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> possibility<00:03:09.440> being

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
causing this to have a possibility being

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.470 
causing this to have a possibility being
turned<00:03:09.890> down<00:03:10.010> we're<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.120> solve<00:03:11.329> that

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
turned down we're going to solve that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.839 
turned down we're going to solve that
problem<00:03:11.780> because<00:03:12.769> what<00:03:12.980> will<00:03:13.040> happen<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.519> able

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
problem because what will happen is able

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.729 
problem because what will happen is able
to<00:03:13.910> push<00:03:14.030> over<00:03:14.299> there<00:03:14.510> she's<00:03:15.290> happy<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> go

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
to push over there she's happy to go

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.509 
to push over there she's happy to go
shooting<00:03:16.670> back<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.120> forth<00:03:17.359> back<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.629> forth

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
shooting back and forth back and forth

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.479 
shooting back and forth back and forth
and<00:03:19.519> we<00:03:19.730> don't<00:03:19.819> want<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.950> subs<00:03:22.250> all<00:03:22.400> of

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
and we don't want that the subs all of

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.680 
and we don't want that the subs all of
it<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.900> also<00:03:24.049> want<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.910> piston<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.480> shoot

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
it we also want this piston to shoot

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.500 
it we also want this piston to shoot
that<00:03:26.870> down<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.799> get<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.950> clean<00:03:28.340> roof

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.110 

self<00:03:32.510> up<00:03:32.630> by<00:03:32.720> doing<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.819> take<00:03:34.819> a<00:03:34.880> redstone

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
self up by doing this take a redstone

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.740 
self up by doing this take a redstone
repeater<00:03:37.060> go<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.239> there

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.569 

taking<00:03:42.750> construction<00:03:43.170> block<00:03:43.349> go<00:03:43.980> one<00:03:44.370> block

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
taking construction block go one block

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.229 
taking construction block go one block
from<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.599> repeater<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:47.060> go<00:03:48.060> right

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
from that repeater and then go right

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.920 
from that repeater and then go right
there<00:03:48.420> ah<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:53.459> place<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.939> right<00:03:54.689> there

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
there ah you place it right there

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.770 
there ah you place it right there
so<00:03:55.439> that<00:03:55.469> powers<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.519> right<00:03:56.609> there

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.910 

place<00:04:00.780> another<00:04:00.900> repeater<00:04:01.290> behind<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.709> blog

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
place another repeater behind that blog

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.069 
place another repeater behind that blog
so<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.250> can<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.400> powered<00:04:05.810> place<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> block

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
so that can be powered place the block
