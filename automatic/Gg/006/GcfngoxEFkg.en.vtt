how<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> works<00:01:56.280> real<00:01:56.579> fast<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
how it works real fast so what in the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.880 
how it works real fast so what in the
world<00:01:59.149> well<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> weird<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.890> okay

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
world well this is a weird one okay

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.230 
world well this is a weird one okay
we're<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> ground<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.820> really

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
we're on the ground now it was really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.819 
we're on the ground now it was really
weird<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.079> you're<00:02:04.170> walking<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.619> this

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
weird so if you're walking around this

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.899 
weird so if you're walking around this
is<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> speed<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.790> walking

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is the speed you're going to be walking

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.570 
is the speed you're going to be walking
out<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.350> run<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.250> simply

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
out then to actually run you simply

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
out then to actually run you simply
double<00:02:08.970> tap<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.989> forward<00:02:10.410> button<00:02:10.770> there

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
double tap this forward button there

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860 
double tap this forward button there
just<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.120> walking<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> speed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
just like that so walking is a speed

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.470 
just like that so walking is a speed
tap<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.440> sprint<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:15.220> go<00:02:15.340> way<00:02:15.610> fast<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.299> can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
tap to sprint you go way fast you can

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360 
tap to sprint you go way fast you can
get<00:02:16.599> around<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:17.019> worlds<00:02:17.319> really<00:02:17.830> nicely<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
get around your worlds really nicely and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.619 
get around your worlds really nicely and
part<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> reason<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.120> hadn't<00:02:19.510> been

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
part of the reason this hadn't been

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.289 
part of the reason this hadn't been
added<00:02:19.930> before<00:02:20.049> was<00:02:20.860> actually<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
added before was actually because the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.440 
added before was actually because the
worlds<00:02:22.599> were<00:02:22.659> only<00:02:22.840> 256<00:02:23.709> x<00:02:24.099> 256<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.239> blocks

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
worlds were only 256 x 256 of the blocks

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110 
worlds were only 256 x 256 of the blocks
and<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.049> world<00:02:26.260> were<00:02:26.739> extremely<00:02:27.159> small<00:02:27.519> so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and the world were extremely small so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.850 
and the world were extremely small so
sprinting<00:02:28.629> would<00:02:29.110> kind<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.379> take<00:02:29.440> away<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
sprinting would kind of take away the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.589 
sprinting would kind of take away the
fun<00:02:30.099> if<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.489> world<00:02:30.760> was<00:02:30.909> small<00:02:31.150> because<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
fun if this world was small because you

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.210 
fun if this world was small because you
could<00:02:31.720> run<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:32.349> corner<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.739> corner<00:02:32.829> you<00:02:33.190> know

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
could run from corner to corner you know

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
could run from corner to corner you know
really<00:02:33.579> fast<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.180> make<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> world's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
really fast and then make the world's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.630 
really fast and then make the world's
feel<00:02:34.870> really<00:02:35.049> small<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.250> worlds

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
feel really small now that the worlds

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.520 
feel really small now that the worlds
are<00:02:36.819> infinite<00:02:37.450> sprinting<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.079> much<00:02:38.319> more

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
are infinite sprinting as a much more

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.740 
are infinite sprinting as a much more
useful<00:02:38.709> tool<00:02:39.099> at<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.000> moment<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.450> obvious

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
useful tool at the moment it's obvious

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.569 
useful tool at the moment it's obvious
you<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.319> mod<00:02:41.590> installed<00:02:42.129> this<00:02:42.489> is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
you have to have a mod installed this is

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.030 
you have to have a mod installed this is
also<00:02:42.760> available<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.450> Android<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.680> method<00:02:44.980> of

also available for Android the method of

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.680 
also available for Android the method of
actually<00:02:45.370> acquiring<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.180> mod<00:02:46.420> and

actually acquiring this mod and
installing<00:02:47.200> through<00:02:47.440> Android<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.859> slightly

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
installing through Android is slightly

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.559 
installing through Android is slightly
different<00:02:48.310> than<00:02:48.459> iOS<00:02:48.609> but<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.120> will<00:02:49.299> create<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569
