00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
this is a really good product so far and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.139 
this is a really good product so far and
I<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.740> been<00:02:08.009> using<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.490> for<00:02:08.520> almost<00:02:08.700> four

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I have been using it for almost four

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.140

weeks<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.410> feel<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:11.220> kinds<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
weeks and I can feel all kinds of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.760 
weeks and I can feel all kinds of
changes<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.690> feel<00:02:12.990> all<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.320> tightness

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
changes I can feel all this tightness

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
changes I can feel all this tightness
coming<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.280> through<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.820> lifting<00:02:15.450> and

coming in through here and lifting and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410 
coming in through here and lifting and
everything<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.430> sure<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> saw<00:02:18.209> my

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
everything so I'm not sure if you saw my

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960 
everything so I'm not sure if you saw my
before<00:02:18.930> video<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.820> any

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.820 
before video if you can see any
difference<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.620> feel

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
difference but I know that I can feel

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.650 
difference but I know that I can feel
the<00:02:22.980> difference<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.670> that's<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:24.300> matters

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the difference and that's what matters

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.979 
the difference and that's what matters
so<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.150> good<00:02:27.300> product<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.900> I
