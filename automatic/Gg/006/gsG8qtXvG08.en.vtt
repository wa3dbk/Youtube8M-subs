00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
scenery is scattered with details but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190 
scenery is scattered with details but
not<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.640> much<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.570> gonna<00:02:38.690> be<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> chore<00:02:39.170> to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
not so much it's gonna be a chore to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320 
not so much it's gonna be a chore to
paint<00:02:39.590> I'm<00:02:40.190> gonna<00:02:40.489> really<00:02:40.730> enjoy<00:02:40.880> painting

some of the centerpiece details and
obviously<00:02:43.970> some<00:02:44.180> other<00:02:44.300> bits<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:44.690> kind<00:02:44.900> of

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
obviously some other bits will kind of

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.990 
obviously some other bits will kind of
leave<00:02:45.200> but<00:02:45.950> as<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.100> said<00:02:46.250> I'm<00:02:46.489> gonna<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.790> through

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that another point it's nice metal

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.750 
that another point it's nice metal
plating<00:02:50.650> sounds<00:02:51.650> silly<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.010> talk<00:02:52.250> about<00:02:52.400> metal

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
plating sounds silly to talk about metal

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.810 
plating sounds silly to talk about metal
plating<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.110> makes<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.820> nice

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
plating like that but it makes for nice

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.580 
plating like that but it makes for nice
textures<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.660> paint<00:02:56.840> jobs<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.440> gonna

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
textures and paint jobs and it's gonna

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.800 
textures and paint jobs and it's gonna
get<00:02:58.250> weathered<00:02:58.610> up<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:59.060> nicely<00:02:59.239> using

then you get two of this booth okay now
on<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.750> other<00:04:53.840> sprue<00:04:54.200> I've<00:04:54.410> already<00:04:54.560> started

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
on the other sprue I've already started

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.230 
on the other sprue I've already started
cutting<00:04:55.100> out<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:55.580> can<00:04:55.820> show<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.030> some<00:04:56.180> of

cutting out so I can show you some of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.930 
cutting out so I can show you some of
the<00:04:56.330> bits<00:04:56.479> how<00:04:56.720> they<00:04:56.840> fit<00:04:56.990> together<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:58.580> this

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
the bits how they fit together so this

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.210 
the bits how they fit together so this
one<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.210> get<00:04:59.540> three<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.169> these<00:05:00.620> kind<00:05:01.070> of

two of these now you could stick these

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.700 
two of these now you could stick these
on<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.270> ends<00:05:08.479> to<00:05:08.570> have<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.720> small<00:05:09.050> emplacement

on the ends to have a small emplacement

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.340 
on the ends to have a small emplacement
you<00:05:09.770> could<00:05:09.919> stick<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.660> heavy<00:05:11.660> gun<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:11.990> heavy

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
you could stick a heavy gun a heavy

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.620 
you could stick a heavy gun a heavy
weapons<00:05:12.680> team<00:05:12.889> for<00:05:13.130> Imperial<00:05:13.490> Guard<00:05:13.699> and

weapons team for Imperial Guard and
there's<00:05:14.870> some<00:05:14.960> other<00:05:15.110> bits<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.380> bobs<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:16.160> can

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
there's some other bits and bobs you can

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.529 
there's some other bits and bobs you can
have<00:05:16.460> them<00:05:16.610> all<00:05:16.669> together<00:05:16.880> as<00:05:17.180> one<00:05:17.210> big

redoubt obviously you've got these
pieces<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:21.020> stick<00:05:21.320> on<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.830> front<00:05:22.220> there<00:05:22.430> again

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
pieces to stick on the front there again

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.629 
pieces to stick on the front there again
so<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:27.039> two<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:29.720> three<00:05:30.349> each<00:05:31.340> one

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
so one two and three each one

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.120 
so one two and three each one
individually<00:05:32.210> detailed<00:05:34.360> yeah<00:05:35.360> so<00:05:36.020> again<00:05:36.950> the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
individually detailed yeah so again the

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.770 
individually detailed yeah so again the
base<00:05:37.310> plates<00:05:37.639> on<00:05:37.789> these<00:05:37.940> are<00:05:38.060> really<00:05:38.419> nice<00:05:38.539> and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
base plates on these are really nice and

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.610 
base plates on these are really nice and
interesting

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
interesting

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.279 
interesting
they'd<00:05:39.979> make<00:05:40.190> really<00:05:40.639> nice<00:05:40.840> rust<00:05:41.840> effects<00:05:42.139> on

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
they'd make really nice rust effects on

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.040 
they'd make really nice rust effects on
there<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:43.210> these<00:05:44.210> these<00:05:44.539> would<00:05:44.690> look<00:05:44.750> great

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
there and these these would look great

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.390 
there and these these would look great
the<00:05:45.139> dry<00:05:45.320> brush<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.680> think<00:05:45.919> even<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.280> one

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
the dry brush and I think even the one

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.940 
the dry brush and I think even the one
on<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.610> box<00:05:46.849> is<00:05:47.419> quite<00:05:47.599> simply<00:05:48.050> fainted<00:05:48.349> using

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
on the box is quite simply fainted using

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.879 
on the box is quite simply fainted using
a<00:05:49.099> basic<00:05:49.570> very<00:05:50.570> very<00:05:50.870> basic<00:05:51.260> techniques<00:05:51.620> very

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
a basic very very basic techniques very

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.200 
a basic very very basic techniques very
little<00:05:52.130> in<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.250> way<00:05:52.280> of<00:05:52.370> edge<00:05:52.550> highlights<00:05:53.000> and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
little in the way of edge highlights and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.150 
little in the way of edge highlights and
stuff<00:05:53.330> like<00:05:53.510> that<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.620> I<00:05:54.680> said<00:05:54.830> they<00:05:54.919> were<00:05:55.010> two

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
stuff like that so I said they were two

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.909 
stuff like that so I said they were two
of<00:05:55.280> these<00:05:55.370> sprues<00:05:55.729> like<00:05:56.419> I<00:05:56.450> said<00:05:56.800> about<00:05:57.800> the

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
of these sprues like I said about the

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.680 
of these sprues like I said about the
noise<00:05:58.099> where<00:05:58.849> we<00:05:58.940> start<00:05:59.180> cutting<00:05:59.360> out<00:05:59.510> this

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
noise where we start cutting out this

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.210 
noise where we start cutting out this
one<00:05:59.900> but<00:06:00.050> that<00:06:00.080> is<00:06:00.289> exactly<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.830> same<00:06:01.010> as<00:06:01.130> the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
one but that is exactly the same as the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.339 
one but that is exactly the same as the
other<00:06:01.340> one<00:06:01.430> you've<00:06:01.550> just<00:06:01.729> seen<00:06:02.050> so<00:06:03.050> here's<00:06:03.200> one

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
other one you've just seen so here's one

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:09.010 
other one you've just seen so here's one
of<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.500> pieces<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:05.500> okay<00:06:07.090> now<00:06:08.090> it's<00:06:08.660> nice<00:06:08.810> thing

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
of the pieces I okay now it's nice thing

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.690 
of the pieces I okay now it's nice thing
about<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:10.479> is<00:06:11.479> you've<00:06:11.690> got<00:06:11.840> little<00:06:12.020> Clips<00:06:12.700> to

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
about this is you've got little Clips to

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.659 
about this is you've got little Clips to
actually<00:06:13.940> clip<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.240> pieces<00:06:14.570> on<00:06:15.340> how<00:06:16.340> they<00:06:16.520> go

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
actually clip the pieces on how they go

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.850 
actually clip the pieces on how they go
now<00:06:17.630> obviously<00:06:17.990> that's<00:06:18.110> just<00:06:18.229> to<00:06:18.470> stop<00:06:18.680> them

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
now obviously that's just to stop them

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.980
