00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
a little bit in your lower palate yeah

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.850

right and yet you can still talk alright
I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.209> when<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.329> have<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.570> sort<00:02:36.930> of

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
I think when you have that sort of

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.680 
I think when you have that sort of
mental<00:02:37.470> block<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:39.570> probably<00:02:40.230> comes<00:02:40.470> from<00:02:41.690> not

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
mental block it probably comes from not

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.539 
mental block it probably comes from not
having<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.230> confidence<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.130> when<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
having the confidence that when you

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:53.240 
having the confidence that when you
inhale<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.060> won't<00:02:45.630> choke<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:52.079> can<00:02:52.260> lovely
