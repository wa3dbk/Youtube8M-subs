00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
you have to crack it out of the case

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.350 
you have to crack it out of the case
just<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.430> two<00:00:35.940> terabyte

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
just for show I have my two terabyte

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
just for show I have my two terabyte
already<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.930> Playstation<00:00:37.530> 4

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
already in my Playstation 4

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.250 
already in my Playstation 4
I<00:00:38.010> put<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> stock<00:00:38.820> 500<00:00:39.329> gig<00:00:39.450> back<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.960> here

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
I put the stock 500 gig back in here

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
I put the stock 500 gig back in here
just<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> process

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just so you can see what the process

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
just so you can see what the process
generally<00:00:42.420> looks<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:43.100> when<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
generally looks like when you get it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.420 
generally looks like when you get it
home<00:00:44.600> open<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.780> you're<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.829> crack<00:00:47.280> open

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
home open it up you're gonna crack open

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.060 
home open it up you're gonna crack open
the<00:00:47.640> case<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.200> didn't<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.680> did<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> pretty

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the case I didn't see it I did a pretty

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
the case I didn't see it I did a pretty
decent<00:00:50.340> job<00:00:50.370> getting<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.270> time

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
decent job getting out the first time

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
decent job getting out the first time
keeping<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> intact<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.010> able<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
keeping it intact I was actually able to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.299 
keeping it intact I was actually able to
get<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.699> drive<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
get a drive back into it

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.380 
get a drive back into it
so<00:00:56.309> I'll<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.670> through<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> same<00:00:57.030> process

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so I'll just go through the same process

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.220 
so I'll just go through the same process
again<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> started<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.899> work<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
again to get it started we work at a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.779 
again to get it started we work at a
corner<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> small<00:01:02.550> flat-head

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
corner you can get a small flat-head

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
corner you can get a small flat-head
screwdriver<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> pretty

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
screwdriver if you want but it's pretty

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.320 
screwdriver if you want but it's pretty
easy<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.549> long<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> corner<00:01:06.689> started

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
easy as long as you get a corner started

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
easy as long as you get a corner started
it's<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:10.049> snapped<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.650> place<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:11.790> as

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it's it's snapped into place as well as

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.890 
it's it's snapped into place as well as
adhesive<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> takes<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.509> bit<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.810> get

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
adhesive so it takes a little bit to get

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
adhesive so it takes a little bit to get
it<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.140> without<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:17.159> damage<00:01:17.490> without

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it out without actually damage without

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
it out without actually damage without
actually<00:01:18.060> bending<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> aluminum<00:01:19.439> plate<00:01:19.740> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
actually bending the aluminum plate so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
actually bending the aluminum plate so
as<00:01:20.909> long<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.330> well<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:21.810> really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
as long as you as well you're not really

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
as long as you as well you're not really
gonna<00:01:22.140> bend<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> once<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> Seagate

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
gonna bend so once you get the Seagate

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.160 
gonna bend so once you get the Seagate
lumina<00:01:27.810> plate<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.900> drive

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
lumina plate off you now have your drive

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.149 
lumina plate off you now have your drive
inside<00:01:32.570> as<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> 500

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
inside as you can see this is a 500

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.300 
inside as you can see this is a 500
gigabyte<00:01:36.170> HGST<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.740> came<00:01:37.860> stock<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
gigabyte HGST that came stock with the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
gigabyte HGST that came stock with the
ps4<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> USB<00:01:41.030> 3.0<00:01:42.470> connection<00:01:43.470> right

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
ps4 you see the USB 3.0 connection right

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.929 
ps4 you see the USB 3.0 connection right
there<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:45.060> essentially<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
there that essentially is just a

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.100 
there that essentially is just a
attachment<00:01:50.210> once<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
attachment once you actually get the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
attachment once you actually get the
drive<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
drive out again on this just kind of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
drive out again on this just kind of
kept<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.210> place<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.450> adhesive<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
kept in place by adhesive so it's not

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.039 
kept in place by adhesive so it's not
really<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> tight

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
really all in there all that tight

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
really all in there all that tight
nothing<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.820> worried<00:02:00.060> about

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
nothing to really really worried about

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.600 
nothing to really really worried about
