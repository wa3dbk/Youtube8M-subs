all the luck 12 this is gonna be video
on<00:00:07.140> how<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.610> track<00:00:08.900> as<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.139> see<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.380> my

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
on how to track as you can see I have my

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
on how to track as you can see I have my
obsidian<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.700> my<00:00:11.849> diamond<00:00:12.300> blocks<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> I

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
obsidian I have my diamond blocks and I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.710 
obsidian I have my diamond blocks and I
my<00:00:13.200> gold<00:00:13.590> blocks<00:00:14.750> already<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.720> diamond

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
my gold blocks already so a diamond

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.620 
my gold blocks already so a diamond
block<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.830> center<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.310> tracker

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
block is the very center of your tracker

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
block is the very center of your tracker
each<00:00:21.630> obsidian<00:00:22.500> block<00:00:22.769> tracks<00:00:23.640> 25<00:00:24.390> blocks

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
each obsidian block tracks 25 blocks

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.130 
each obsidian block tracks 25 blocks
outward<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.420> Forbes<00:00:27.779> sitting<00:00:28.050> we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
outward so if we have Forbes sitting we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.490 
outward so if we have Forbes sitting we
track<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> hundred<00:00:28.830> blocks<00:00:29.099> outward<00:00:30.109> or<00:00:31.109> more

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
track a hundred blocks outward or more

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.590 
track a hundred blocks outward or more
we<00:00:31.679> track<00:00:32.160> 200<00:00:33.149> outward<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> let's<00:00:35.670> quickly

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.680 

make<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.899> tracker<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:42.090> must<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> gold

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
make our tracker you must have a gold

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
make our tracker you must have a gold
block<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> end<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.770> each<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.730> else<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
block at the end of each one or else it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.229 
block at the end of each one or else it
is<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> valid<00:00:46.140> tracking<00:00:46.710> compass<00:00:49.820> for<00:00:50.820> one

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
is not a valid tracking compass for one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.619 
is not a valid tracking compass for one
two<00:00:51.660> three<00:00:52.110> four<00:00:52.640> okay<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.360> your

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
two three four okay so you now have your

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.660 
two three four okay so you now have your
tracker<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:55.500> type<00:00:55.770> such<00:00:56.070> track<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:57.090> on

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
tracker you will type such track all on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
tracker you will type such track all on
mcpvp<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:01:00.149> doing<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> single<00:01:00.899> player<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
mcpvp I'm doing this a single player so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.750 
mcpvp I'm doing this a single player so
I<00:01:02.750> don't<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> commands<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.979> /<00:01:05.280> trek

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I don't have the commands you do / trek

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.950 
I don't have the commands you do / trek
all<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.640> want<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> narrow<00:01:09.360> his<00:01:09.450> cords

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
all and as you want to narrow his cords

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200 
all and as you want to narrow his cords
let's<00:01:10.200> say<00:01:10.380> he<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.520> destroy<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
let's say he is this way you destroy the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.620 
let's say he is this way you destroy the
golden<00:01:12.689> block<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.890> move<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> closer<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.090> /

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
golden block you move it closer you /

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
golden block you move it closer you /
trek<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.590> his<00:01:16.710> name<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> still<00:01:17.250> within<00:01:17.400> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
trek all of his name is still within you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
trek all of his name is still within you
keep<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> moving<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> closer<00:01:18.720> till<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.259> not

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
keep on moving it closer till he is not

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
keep on moving it closer till he is not
within<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.630> narrow<00:01:22.049> his<00:01:22.229> cords<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> do

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
within then you narrow his cords you do

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
within then you narrow his cords you do
the<00:01:23.100> math<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.290> now<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> by

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the math and you get it now this is by

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.120 
the math and you get it now this is by
far<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> easiest<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.330> track<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
far the easiest way to a track it's a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.550 
far the easiest way to a track it's a
very<00:01:29.369> simple<00:01:29.689> tracking<00:01:30.689> method<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.380> just

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
very simple tracking method you just

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
very simple tracking method you just
have<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> diamond<00:01:32.520> block<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> very

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have the diamond block in the very

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.830 
have the diamond block in the very
center<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.759> four<00:01:35.759> wings<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.540> each

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
center you have four wings go out each

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.760 
center you have four wings go out each
in<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.170> direction<00:01:37.350> each<00:01:37.829> by<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:39.060> narrow

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
in one direction each by one narrow

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.240 
in one direction each by one narrow
strip<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> find<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.659> them

quickly add the gold blah I find it much
more<00:02:06.329> easier<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.770> x-ray<00:02:08.459> these<00:02:08.789> types<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
more easier to x-ray these types of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.210 
more easier to x-ray these types of
trackers<00:02:11.239> so

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
trackers so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.130 
trackers so

it would look like that except I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.670 
it would look like that except I
flip-flopped<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.459> accident<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.800> that's<00:03:01.370> okay

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
vanilla tracker you stand here / track

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.449 
vanilla tracker you stand here / track
all<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:11.510> goes<00:03:11.630> up<00:03:11.840> by<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:12.500> each<00:03:12.860> time<00:03:13.190> it

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
all it just goes up by one each time it

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.830

goes up by 12 like four or five this is

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.960 
goes up by 12 like four or five this is
by<00:03:17.959> far<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.230> worst<00:03:18.650> tracker<00:03:19.160> in<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.489> game

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
by far the worst tracker in the game

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.390 
by far the worst tracker in the game
because<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.780> takes<00:03:20.930> up<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.440> much<00:03:21.470> more<00:03:21.860> area

takes<00:03:23.239> up<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:23.630> much<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:24.019> resources<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.220> it

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
takes up so much more resources and it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.940 
takes up so much more resources and it
just<00:03:26.300> takes<00:03:26.480> up<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.750> much<00:03:26.780> area<00:03:27.320> when<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.800> make
