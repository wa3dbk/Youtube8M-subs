00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.580
 ok and grace, it's okay because not 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 Exaggerating that also has to be realistic 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.740
 Both stones are not allowed too far 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 away where else do you have those from the far 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 they must have gone for me 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 dying on the way the object left 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:47.469
 go away from me if you burst a zombie 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.869
 Who would you know what ? 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.939
 would you do if your parents have zombies 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.560
 they are dead and we know 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.600
 as a hobby that will never happen again 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.829
 they will experience and they will suffer if 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.390
 the know that's why I would the 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.289
 probably kill yes i believe 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.149
 I would do that 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.729
 I would not make you sick like that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.100
 when login data then hold and 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.509
 Fitter I only think well 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.799
 Do you know if you are right now? 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.959

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.540
 say how you want me to do that 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.209
 how does your survival plan look like? 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.769
 I do not want an answer from there 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 I give you that 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.260
 and if you want to know how meant 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.849
 waibel looks like plan 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.269
 and if you want to know how one 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.209
 Survival plan should look like then 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.910
 clicked on it better should the zombie 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.910
 apocalypse happen or not 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.549
 now I should say no 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.870
 Of course not because that's what 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.450
 is terrible and people are dying 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.060
 that's why no, but a little bit too 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.410
 already because how many times have I been in mine 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.019
 live already said it was was right 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.370
 Cool when papers and ghosts give 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.510
 and that's why you think so too 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.889
 always so a bit because on the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.329
 one side is afraid so before 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.530
 But at least it is on me 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.700
 I wish the other side too 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 a little bit that that exists because then 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.920
 super exciting that I see you guys 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.349
 Let's live by the vampires 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.190
 diaries or true blood or at 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.060
 buffy or charm as much as that too 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
 do have 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.590
 they have really exciting life like that 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.510
 while we sit here on the sofa and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.569
 the outside are out and about 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.030
 hunt ghosts and demons and vampires 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.870
 and somehow I think that's cool on the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.209
 1 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:35.950

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.330
