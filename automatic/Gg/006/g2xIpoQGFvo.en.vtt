00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.880
 sick and mysterious cube the gem of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.160
 diane version 8 where this original 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 plastic here is perfect amazing 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.040
 I found this gem the other day 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 chopping in a mine in minecraft 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510
 mysteries of the good life we ​​go to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.310
 see it up close we're going to see it up close 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 first place because I see here many 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 pieces and some very rare things not a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 hexagonal face one each triangular good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.599
 how many pieces do we have here of how many 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.130
 pieces we are talking about 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.590
 Well, it has more than it seems 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.969
 ok we have these centers first 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 thick and large hexagonal not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.430
 we have these triangular centers in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.829
 the triangular faces, by the way, 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.290
 colors are opposite red is opposite 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.469
 red yellow opposite yellow and so not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 it's worth more we have good we have these 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.920
 pieces of here that are as exquisite 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.170
 ok is this then we have ok you see 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.559
 you're here and you think they're 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.329
 all the same but we do not have any pieces 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.250
 shared on the hexagonal faces 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 you're here and this is one piece this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.899
 it is indivisible it is worth a block 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.340
 these two but then we have pieces like 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.780
 hexagonal face to triangular and they are two 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.119
 different pieces worth we have this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 petal and this center but they are not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 together these two pieces are worth these two 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 no but these two if they are a block 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.439
 so good call the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 Attention not at first equal to you 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.770
 you confuse you think it sounds but they are more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.539
 good because I say that this cube is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 sick let's see this original 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.679
 disgusting plastic good to see by 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 example you know what I know if 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.549
 you are in a hospital admitted and are 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.189
 to eat is always such a good meal 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 a little bit depressing in general, not so 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 If in addition to feeding you, they gave you a 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 cube would give you in this cube here this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.729
 from here with this color with this form 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.009
 sure I have no doubt and good to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 see what else it gives you there are not many and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 there are so many in the market I had 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.799
 a good one I have another on the way to no 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.209
 sorry I have two on the way by miguel 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.799
 please I have two on the way 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.420
 maybe I bought more but I already had another 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.299
 for quite some time and what yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 two years or three is here that you see that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.689
 is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.540
 Well, not big enough, and it also has 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.849
 so hexagonal faces not then 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.970
 we have some square coves you see tours 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.650
 and it can also rotate so good is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.390
 quite quite surprising 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.090
 I solved it a few times and then the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.670
 I said there forgotten you see here how it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 note this form no but to see I think 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.880
 that in general these diane gems 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.519
 they are very well not and if you like them then 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.989
 you can start a collection one 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.330
 perfect collection or that I know 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.890
 maybe I'll be in charge or maybe it's me 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.810
 buy all that are left because no 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 let's see why not good but let yourself 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.900
 of rolls how does this cube turn good 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.160
 has turns of 120 degrees before 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.959
 undo I'm going to show you an algorithm 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.700
 very interesting that I found the other day 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.140
 that allows three corners to see if what 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.019
 we can do now first I do this 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.140
 turn then commented here these locks 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.880
 something like that and let's see if not me yes no 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.850
 I'm confusing and that many times I 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.810
 I confuse good I think that effectively 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.319
 everything has worked out well 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.180
 you see that he has permuted three corners worth 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.930
 is 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 green blue yellow wine here is wine 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.459
 here and this wine here is not this and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 these three corners have been 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.930
 permuted and the algorithm is fine 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.939
 this algorithm is very useful 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 let's go undoing it and commented a 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.170
 couple of problems that this quota has a 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.030
 couple of problems the first this is already 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.040
 It blocks a lot, it blocks a lot 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.930
 let's see if I get another blockade you see 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.120
 why these blockages happen because 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.090
 you are watching this piece 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.739
 is here you see how he is hooking and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.049
 this happens constantly 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.659
 constantly to see maybe you can 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.849
 solve adjusting tensions or I that 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.919
 I know throwing him a position over me 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.810
 I'm not sure what the solution is but 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.519
 it bothers pretty especially about everything 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.799
 because it is a relatively expensive cube 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.019
 for what is worth is not the typical played 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.090
 from 5 euros seven euros no it was not expensive 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.099
 ok I do not remember the price but for the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.079
 price that has this can not happen 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.480
 this can not happen that I find out 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.389
 but good leaving aside those 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.360
 blocking problems and the price is a 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.030
 entertaining and interesting cube to see 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.470
 maybe maybe it got blocked because it's 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.200
 sick is as I said before with this 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.640
 color you can not ask for more but the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.980
 problem is that you can also pop 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.810
 because of course I was given an algorithm 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.359
 you stay so you nervous forces 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.739
 a little more and skip the pieces good is 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.209
 true that they are very easy to place 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.220
 ok they jumped me the other day a couple of 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.300
 pieces and nothing place them without problem 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.949
 but good annoying annoying enough not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.949
 let's do a few more turns 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.830
 and maybe I ordered this black version 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.090
 it's also worth it and you do not start buying 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.470
 more than more than diane and I ordered them 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.630
 all in black because I like them a lot 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.950
 I have one on the way I have one on the way 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.620
 awesome voucher I leave a photo for 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.510
 here that is incredible incredible good to 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.760
 see, that's how it gets undone, we're going to 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.330
 watch 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.740
 You see, it's not confusing because you see 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.930
 so all these pieces and at the beginning 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.480
 to make a mess and as you see the way 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.900
 the shape is just like that of a pyramid 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.460
 truncated or is I if I take a pyramid 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.650
 How pretty is this pyramid? 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.229
 please and water yes no 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.930
 I have like this as this block if I do not 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.120
 I'm wrong a truncated pyramid to see 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.650
 although the shape is that of a pyramid 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 it has nothing to do with the pyramids 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.889
 ok this cube has many more 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.389
 pieces and it's another different concept but 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.590
 well that's how the yang gem looks 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.900
 although I have it out there marginalized 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.190
 completely undone to see if you want 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.780
 start collecting diane gems 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.699
 you can start with this vale maybe with 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.430
 black background that is a little prettier 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.830
 to see this cube is not complicated either 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.789
 is simple is not elementary either but 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.280
 it's complicated he has a difficulty 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.509
 intermediate that's why I say it 's a good 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.460
 cube to start collecting gems from 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.320
 diane and if you like it then you know a 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.880
 buy all the diane man that 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.750
 I thought you were good, I 'm going to fire 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.759
 here with the best of all the best is 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.320
 this is the maximum gem is so 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.449
 it is impossible to find is worth you spades 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.800
 and spades and the fish cube never appears 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.720
 there is never only one there is only one 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.690
 question type t again impossible 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.889
 Well I hope me that this dismissal was 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.940
 can you put poor here do not go see 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.849
 the little fish that stay stuck 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.199
 with things you're not plastic 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.560
 disrespect this I bought it another 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.330
 day to put spheres 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.040
 but the truth does not work very well 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.020
 because there are loads waiting they are mere 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.030
 with that indifferent balance that 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.560
 they have to give them all good not me 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.740
 roll more I hope you liked it 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.740
 the video as always and let in others
