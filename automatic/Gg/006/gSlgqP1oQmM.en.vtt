well<00:00:01.829> here's<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:04.220> 503<00:00:05.330> are<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.480> building<00:00:06.720> it

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
well here's the 503 are you building it

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
well here's the 503 are you building it
you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.189> see<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> cross<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.360> still<00:00:09.630> in

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
you can see the cross that you still in

you can see the cross that you still in
that<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:12.200> you<00:00:13.200> can<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.620> where<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> piston

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that one you can see where the piston

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.670 
that one you can see where the piston
caught<00:00:14.759> there<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> port<00:00:18.050> last<00:00:19.050> year<00:00:19.500> on

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

second here we go with the brand-new
piston<00:00:27.170> wrist<00:00:28.170> pain<00:00:28.460> rings<00:00:30.619> all<00:00:31.619> ready<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.219> go

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
piston wrist pain rings all ready to go

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.000 
piston wrist pain rings all ready to go
in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> cylinder<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.290> box<00:00:34.500> there's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
in the cylinder that's one box there's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
in the cylinder that's one box there's
the<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.930> engine<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.190> rebuilt<00:00:38.760> in

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the other engine about to be rebuilt in

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
clutch all the way to the fans road

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
clutch all the way to the fans road
bottom<00:00:54.420> end<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:55.020> nothing<00:00:55.710> wrong<00:00:56.070> there

crane bearings and seals were done last

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.850 
crane bearings and seals were done last
year<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> everything's<00:01:01.079> good

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.900 

here's<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> second<00:01:11.060> part<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.510> video

don't<00:01:13.910> really<00:01:14.150> need<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.330> show<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.750> I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
don't really need to show you that I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.010 
don't really need to show you that I
guess<00:01:17.110> brand-new<00:01:18.110> cylinders<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:18.860> there

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
guess brand-new cylinders in there

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.050 
guess brand-new cylinders in there
hold<00:01:21.020> up<00:01:21.230> rag<00:01:21.860> stuffed<00:01:22.220> up<00:01:22.490> keep<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.910> holes

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
hold up rag stuffed up keep the holes

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.130 
hold up rag stuffed up keep the holes
they're<00:01:23.390> nice<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.020> clean<00:01:25.720> one<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.930> old

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
they're nice and clean one of the old

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.910 
they're nice and clean one of the old
business<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:29.360> side<00:01:29.600> wasn't<00:01:29.900> too<00:01:30.200> bad<00:01:30.440> it

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
business this side wasn't too bad it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.990 
business this side wasn't too bad it
didn't<00:01:31.100> really<00:01:31.250> rubber<00:01:31.610> nothing<00:01:32.230> rings<00:01:33.230> for

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
didn't really rubber nothing rings for

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.640 
didn't really rubber nothing rings for
couldn't<00:01:35.000> find<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.450> old<00:01:35.600> piston<00:01:36.080> so<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.380> guess

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
couldn't find the old piston so I guess

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.430 
couldn't find the old piston so I guess
I<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.310> show<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.990> other<00:01:39.140> ones

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
I have to show you one of the other ones

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.320 
I have to show you one of the other ones

that's a little bit a big dip about that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.830 
that's a little bit a big dip about that
size<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:59.300> their<00:02:00.160> exhaust<00:02:01.160> pipe<00:02:01.790> off<00:02:02.030> aluminum
