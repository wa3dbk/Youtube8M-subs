00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:19.320
 've asked I answer in turn 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.550
 have my last flashlight video 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.349
 I am yes with the flashlight 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.419
 actually managed me a tea 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.369
 to cook water and did he ask you 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.169
 what would you do with so much power 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 and that is exactly why it should be today 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.859
 always the last video I have one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.199
 Flashlight uses the 6500 10 lumens 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.239
 has and therefore has a theme of water 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.280
 cooked because they have seen that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 you like that here and there he has 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.129
 then calls me an abo or me 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 has a subscribent then attentive 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 yes there are cases that still has a lot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.429
 more and I am there she is the tonight 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.350
 36 et with 7300 lumens and jajaja 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.539
 Competencies carton has longer shows 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 It has a few descriptions 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.489
 a bit of advertising has a cure 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 divorce and yes it comes in such a way 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 bag who cares 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 and yes the bags but also with 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.430
 his magazine has also filled up for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.439
 such batteries so 18 650 the whole 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 Part is made of aluminum plane 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.640
 Aluminum has produced one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.369
 reach of 285 meters and a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.060
 total weight without batteries of 397 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.070
 gram and also has a standard 806 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 created with whom you can put by 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.450
 very awake to very high at 7,300 lumens 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 she still has a brand time 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 from 5 to 90 minutes for me 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 only visual difference to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.219
 predecessor model is here in the leds too 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.270
 see the xc70 ellison slightly larger here 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.110
 otherwise you will not see it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 knaller 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.460
 and of course the thing at night too 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.770
 not logical here it is however so 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.289
 that between the 6000 and 59 10 lumens 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 the seven 1300 lumens plain 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.990
 gripping no difference is you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 look into the sun you will become blind 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.689
 well back in the sun you know 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.219
 hello again blindly 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.439
 one wanted to know what happens when 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.939
 one holds a magnifying glass in front of it and another 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.689
 today, if he knows a match 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.920
 can ignite 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.209
 Now let's see if that's the case 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.039
 works before I but now 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.660
 keep going 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.420
 safety first of course i like you like 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.800
 always, however 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.190
 and in the description of that looks 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 if that interests you match 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.120
 magnifying glass 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:43.510
 When I go, I have the magnifying glass 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:45.370
 burned that is it should probably too 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.900
 the question clarified whether one with it one 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.090
 make car tires melt 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.569
 can the whole try now without 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.569
 the magnifying glass 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.489
 here should probably the automatic of the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.989
 Flashlight down too soon as soon as the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.599
 has reached a certain temperature in 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.219
 the fall 80 degrees served down so 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.819
 unfortunately it will not be that way 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.019
 function 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.420
 I asked if you were with 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.629
 you can burst balloons 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.629
 can 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.409
 I was asked whether with one chuck 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.409
 close can produce 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 Again, we have the problem that the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.730
 Flashlight shuts off too early 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.200
 Of course, that housing eventually becomes too 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.910
 gets hot should we do 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.410
 any success and would be in the case 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.270
 I will do the mirroring 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.830
 now from this tin down yes a hole 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.600
 cut in the whole cut something 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.340
 and I almost create a cook 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
 container is here our mister partie in 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.690
 This is how our cook is consolidated 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.180
 meanwhile, from a small one 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.180
 cooking spoon and that thing up 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.800
 we see a little bit still going on 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.620
 I'll leave it a bit longer and 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.110
 then our scrambled eggs are ready 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:36.140
 As you can see, my work is ready 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.140
 out and say we have ours 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.880
 Realistically happy that the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.680
 previous attempts with the jackpot and 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.510
 The matches did not work 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.160
 because that proves me that she 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.740
 Flashlights the system works 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.060
 that I use the lamp when overheating then 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.440
 turns off if he is a bit 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.730
 insane if you imagine that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.620
 that brender for an hour 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.900
 yes at some point the batteries are through 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.670
 then that will be really dangerous for me 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.230
 hope you liked the video if 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.920
 yes what we subscribe to a little 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.690
 do not forget 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.400
 however, be as it may 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.410
 See you at the next project if 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.410
 you subscribed then bye stefan
