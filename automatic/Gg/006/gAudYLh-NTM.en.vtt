he owed me 35 so I pretty much got a
steal<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> deal<00:00:50.449> now<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.809> sigma

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
steal of a deal now this is a sigma

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.209 
steal of a deal now this is a sigma
let's<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.329> remember<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> kind<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.219> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
let's see remember what kind it is it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.639 
let's see remember what kind it is it's
a<00:00:56.280> sigma<00:00:56.550> 72<00:00:57.300> 300<00:00:57.840> mil<00:00:58.020> millimeter<00:00:59.600> dl<00:01:00.649> macro

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a sigma 72 300 mil millimeter dl macro

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.179 
a sigma 72 300 mil millimeter dl macro
super<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> macro<00:01:04.229> lens<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.040> just

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
super so it's a macro lens and it's just

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.840 
super so it's a macro lens and it's just
a<00:01:05.280> normal

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a normal

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.780 
a normal
Ultra<00:01:06.750> zoom<00:01:06.930> lens<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.360> take<00:01:09.360> off<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> cap<00:01:10.790> it's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
Ultra zoom lens so take off the cap it's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.770 
Ultra zoom lens so take off the cap it's
for<00:01:12.210> canons<00:01:13.400> canons<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.520> autofocus<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
for canons canons with autofocus so you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
for canons canons with autofocus so you
can<00:01:15.900> use<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.229> any<00:01:16.409> red<00:01:16.680> Bullard<00:01:17.040> cos<00:01:17.970> like

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
can use it on any red Bullard cos like

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.390 
can use it on any red Bullard cos like
30<00:01:18.689> D<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.080> even<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> old<00:01:19.770> 35

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to show you how long this camera really

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.859 
to show you how long this camera really
is<00:01:27.680> there<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> normal<00:01:29.250> mode<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.820> far<00:01:30.780> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
is there it is a normal mode as far as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
is there it is a normal mode as far as
I'm<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.110> normal<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.159> I'll<00:01:32.280> take<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
I'm going normal so then I'll take this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.929 
I'm going normal so then I'll take this
little<00:01:32.670> button<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:34.310> set<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.340> macro

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's not macro like that that's gonna

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.300 
it's not macro like that that's gonna
come<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.550> fuzzy<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:10.349> macro<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.069> in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
come out fuzzy it's actually macro as in

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.290 
come out fuzzy it's actually macro as in
like

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
like
you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.590> four<00:02:13.710> feet<00:02:13.890> away

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you can you have to do it four feet away

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.260 
you can you have to do it four feet away
which<00:02:14.280> doesn't<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.640> sense<00:02:14.700> because<00:02:14.970> I'm<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
which doesn't make sense because I'm a

which doesn't make sense because I'm a
big<00:02:15.510> flower<00:02:15.720> shooter<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:17.070> macro<00:02:17.520> type

person<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.560> really<00:02:19.830> doesn't<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
person and this really doesn't do the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.520 
person and this really doesn't do the
job<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.960> will<00:02:22.110> definitely<00:02:22.230> get

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
job for it but this will definitely get

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190 
job for it but this will definitely get
the<00:02:22.590> job<00:02:22.680> done<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.250> me<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> other<00:02:24.200> situations

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the job done for me in other situations

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.050 
the job done for me in other situations
I<00:02:25.350> mean<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.650> need<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.920> zoom<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.340> far<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.940> mean

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
I mean if I need to zoom in far I mean

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.180 
I mean if I need to zoom in far I mean
most<00:02:27.840> kit<00:02:28.200> lenses<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.800> come<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.160> your

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that or an 18 to 55 and they don't zoom

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.870 
that or an 18 to 55 and they don't zoom
in<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.710> much<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.100> only<00:02:35.220> zoom<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.640> maybe<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
in that much the only zoom in maybe a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300 
in that much the only zoom in maybe a
couple<00:02:36.210> feet<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.770> will<00:02:37.950> zoom<00:02:38.100> in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
couple feet if that so this will zoom in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.790 
couple feet if that so this will zoom in
pretty<00:02:38.940> darn<00:02:39.240> far<00:02:39.510> I'll<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.410> let<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.620> know

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
pretty darn far I'll just let you know

pretty darn far I'll just let you know
that<00:02:40.950> right<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.810> only<00:02:42.810> problem<00:02:43.080> I'm

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
that right now the only problem I'm

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.270 
that right now the only problem I'm
running<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:44.540> honestly<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.650> fact<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.010> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
running into honestly is the fact that I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940 
running into honestly is the fact that I
don't<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:48.240> camera<00:02:49.050> besides<00:02:49.530> my<00:02:49.710> point

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
shoot I have a little point and shoot

fujifilm<00:02:53.220> finepix<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.300> it's<00:02:54.390> an<00:02:54.480> S<00:02:54.660> 700

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
fujifilm finepix I think it's an S 700

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.250 
fujifilm finepix I think it's an S 700
and<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.520> doesn't<00:02:56.790> take<00:02:56.940> X<00:02:57.360> different<00:02:57.990> lenses

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and it doesn't take X different lenses

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.250 
and it doesn't take X different lenses
it's<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> DSLR<00:02:59.340> an<00:02:59.670> SLR<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.660> Olympus's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
it's not a DSLR an SLR like my Olympus's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.750 
it's not a DSLR an SLR like my Olympus's
but<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.190> my<00:03:02.310> Olympus<00:03:02.720> will<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.870> use<00:03:04.320> this

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
but this is my Olympus will not use this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
but this is my Olympus will not use this
so<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:06.270> much<00:03:06.560> I'm<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.980> need<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:08.940> any<00:03:09.090> of
