00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.130
 We are making a video for this 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 Mazda 626 glx vehicle 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 the team 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.590
 the vehicle comes equipped with wheels of 16 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.590
 inches over 6 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.410
 how can I see your line as it is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.920
 perfect in the car because it has not been 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920
 shocked 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.079
 everything works for you is a five vehicle 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.010
 changes digital screen central lock 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:37.190
 air conditioning electric glasses 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.190
 electric mirrors 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 now everything works 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.520
 the papers I find so day what 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.520
 only make sure it was already expired 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.510
 taxes are up to date and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 let's see the functionality of 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.140
 device 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.019
 there the lights were on 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.450
 the parking light 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.870
 let's see the engine for a moment 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.870
 A) Yes 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.440
 well, additional that the equipment 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.460
 since 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.930
 of a model because it has already passed 89 is 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.680
 a motor is found seem very good 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.540
 terms 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.580
 the car has been very well treated 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.680
 the battery is completely not only 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.390
 has three months debut and then really 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.370
 I did not have any because the car has 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.370
 stopped for many days many months 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.280
 let's see the board internally 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.280
 Y 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.420
 I currently have the car with the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.640
 air conditioning on 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.680
 we can realize this screen 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.549
 that I have activated here that we can 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.450
 realize that air conditioning 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.369
 Its on 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.789
 and through this screen we can give ourselves 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.789
 account 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.830
 that externally we are in a 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.720
 current temperature of 30.5 degrees and the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.230
 air conditioning where the sensor is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 of the grid is throwing 6.3 degrees 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.640
 centigrade the air conditioner that 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.230
 car is therefore the truth particularly 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 It is of excellent quality 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.999
 and the sliding grids 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.180
 if we can find out, they work 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.180
 correctly 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.400
 and here we can see the screen of 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:50.690
 vehicle is totally digital the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.790
 gas mileage 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.860
 the temperature everything is completely 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.440
 digital we're going to remove the light from 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.440
 parking and works perfectly well 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.870
 if we realize the mirrors are 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.870
 electrical and I'm moving them 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.670
 they work completely fine 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.510
 s on the driver's side and now 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.349
 the passage 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.540
 the carriage has wound catch of 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.540
 leather 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.980
 I recently know 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.560
 it was ordered to paint 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.060
 in the back it is also made of leather 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.480
 simply because we protect it with 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.480
 some linings 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.780
 has a very good player radio 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.780
 I decided 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.920
 has a luxury address 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.740
 their portfolios as I put them see then they 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.740
 They are in very good condition 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.730
 let's move up the radius 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.319
 Well, the best 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.319
 as for the remote 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.460
 and also 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.830
 I decided 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.010
 if it is improving 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.710
 in perfect state 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.060
 works perfect motorcycle assume the 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.710
 watch will work very well let's 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.710
 move with the back of the vehicle 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.190
 good and that's all for now many 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.190
 Thank you
