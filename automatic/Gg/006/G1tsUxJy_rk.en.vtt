these<00:00:56.129> partners<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> airport<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
these partners is because the airport is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
these partners is because the airport is
a<00:00:57.690> highly<00:00:58.050> complex<00:00:58.500> environment<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.910> need
