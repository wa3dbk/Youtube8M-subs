00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.300 
working more than a day-to-day basis
like<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.310> know<00:02:12.400> my<00:02:12.819> heroes<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.069> kind<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.190> what

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
like you know my heroes and kind of what

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.220 
like you know my heroes and kind of what
got<00:02:15.430> me<00:02:15.580> started<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:16.030> art<00:02:16.599> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> first<00:02:17.019> place

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
got me started in art in the first place

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
got me started in art in the first place
you<00:02:18.040> know<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.190> think<00:02:18.580> they've<00:02:19.269> definitely<00:02:19.930> gone

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
you know I think they've definitely gone

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.119 
you know I think they've definitely gone
after<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.819> real<00:02:22.569> intention<00:02:23.170> behind<00:02:23.319> every<00:02:23.860> set

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
after a real intention behind every set

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.880 
after a real intention behind every set
and<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:25.299> think<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.629> goal<00:02:25.870> ultimately<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.680> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
and I think the goal ultimately is to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.830 
and I think the goal ultimately is to
you<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.519> pick<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> card<00:02:28.299> oh<00:02:28.569> that's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you know you pick up a card oh that's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
you know you pick up a card oh that's
from<00:02:28.989> lorwyn<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.680> tell<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.400> looks

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
from lorwyn I can tell because it looks

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.130 
from lorwyn I can tell because it looks
like<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.879> from<00:02:31.000> Laura<00:02:31.209> Wynn<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:31.569> you

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
like it's from Laura Wynn and then you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.449 
like it's from Laura Wynn and then you
know<00:02:32.230> oh<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> mirrored<00:02:33.099> end<00:02:33.220> card

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
know oh this is a mirrored end card

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.770 
know oh this is a mirrored end card
because<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.849> looks<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.269> from<00:02:34.390> Meerut

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
because it looks like it's from Meerut

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.350 
because it looks like it's from Meerut
and<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.769> know<00:02:35.890> having<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.360> differentiation

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and you know having that differentiation

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.750 
and you know having that differentiation
between<00:02:37.690> each<00:02:38.170> block<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.220> think<00:02:39.580> really

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
between each block is I think really

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.059 
between each block is I think really
important<00:02:40.269> for<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> product<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.049> whole<00:02:41.140> but

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
important for the product as a whole but

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.330 
important for the product as a whole but
you<00:02:42.280> know<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.670> does<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.870> other<00:02:44.079> hand<00:02:44.380> tie

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340

you know it does on the other hand tie
your<00:02:45.849> hands<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.360> little<00:02:46.480> bit<00:02:46.630> artistically

your hands a little bit artistically

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.410
