00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.790
 good friends, here we have a new 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.020
 Ron 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.559
 of the famous and famous programmers 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.840
 check room of the chevron group that 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.270
 it is the first version that the ice 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.710
 cream sandwich and of course the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.650
 versions that had been released so far 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.320
 of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.180
 of gingerbread were the best 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.420
 had and most downloaded into the network 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.539
 with which I understand that as these people 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.829
 They do not like to stick blind 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.140
 I suppose they will have also taken a 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.730
 very good version good version here 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.660
 we have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.090
 apparently we are facing a version 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.220
 stock because everything all everything 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.220
 appearance even the launcher is stock 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.540
 of samsung is based on what we're going to see 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.660
 in the version x5 here we see the 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.120
 x5 official samsung and about it is 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.520
 cooked this rom what does change is the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.440
 kernel that is none other than ruth but 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.490
 is what we see here on the screen 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.820
 infra 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.700
 and the roma version is the rock chec 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 revolution hb v7 let's see it up close 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 so you can see it well 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.760
 would be the revolution hd v7 here would be the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
 kernel here we would have the radio or the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.870
 modem for echo 5 and the version of 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.680
 android then we are going for the 404 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.150
 and here we see that it is our galaxy s2 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.030

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.810
 samsung stock as little we can say 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.340
 because in terms of appearance we will see 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.760
 what is always 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.890
 the pitcher on this about this 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.190

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.570
