00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
ultra game show because of the sheer

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789 
ultra game show because of the sheer
amount<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.210> craziness<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.049> variety<00:01:43.560> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
amount of craziness and variety that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.980 
amount of craziness and variety that
goes<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> game<00:01:45.509> show<00:01:45.540> done

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
goes into it if it was a game show done

goes into it if it was a game show done
in<00:01:46.110> real<00:01:46.380> life<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> would<00:01:48.240> be

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
in real life I don't think it would be

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
in real life I don't think it would be
producible<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.350> too<00:01:49.799> much<00:01:49.920> health<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
producible at all too much health and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
producible at all too much health and
safety<00:01:50.880> issues<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> too<00:01:51.570> much<00:01:51.720> money<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
safety issues and too much money in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.319 
safety issues and too much money in
creating<00:01:52.590> all<00:01:52.710> those<00:01:52.890> different<00:01:53.250> games<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
creating all those different games so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.789 
creating all those different games so
what<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.540> gonna<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.170> series<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
what I'm gonna do with this series is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
what I'm gonna do with this series is
actually<00:01:56.219> pan<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> over<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.090> number<00:01:57.540> of

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
actually pan it over a number of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870 
actually pan it over a number of
different<00:01:57.899> episodes<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.820> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
different episodes because I want to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
different episodes because I want to

keep each episode short simple and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130

first<00:02:29.500> episode<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.700> wanted<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
first episode I really just wanted to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
first episode I really just wanted to
give<00:02:31.210> an<00:02:31.300> introduction<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> series<00:02:32.470> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
give an introduction to the series and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.380 
give an introduction to the series and
quickly<00:02:32.980> explain<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.400> relationship<00:02:34.180> between

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
quickly explain the relationship between

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.780 
quickly explain the relationship between
me<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.320> builders<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.800> commentators<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
me the builders the commentators and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550 
me the builders the commentators and
everyone<00:02:37.360> else<00:02:37.480> involved<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> process

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
everyone else involved in the process

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.410 
everyone else involved in the process
because<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.670> first<00:02:39.850> steps<00:02:40.240> of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
because I think the first steps of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.270 
because I think the first steps of
understanding<00:02:41.230> what<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.590> always<00:02:41.980> is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
understanding what this always is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160 
understanding what this always is
knowing<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.880> there's<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.210> team<00:02:43.510> behind<00:02:43.780> it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
knowing that there's a team behind it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.160 
knowing that there's a team behind it
and<00:02:44.380> why<00:02:44.980> there<00:02:45.310> needs<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.610> be<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> team<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
and why there needs to be a team I and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.840 
and why there needs to be a team I and
the<00:02:47.350> producer<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.160> editor

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the producer and the editor

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.310 
the producer and the editor
I<00:02:48.880> think<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> editor<00:02:49.960> bit<00:02:50.140> is

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
I think the editor bit is

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.080 
I think the editor bit is
self-explanatory<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> most

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
self-explanatory it's one of the most

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.020 
self-explanatory it's one of the most
tedious<00:02:52.420> jobs<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:53.920> as<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.160> producer<00:02:54.790> I'm<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
tedious jobs but as the producer I'm the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.180 
tedious jobs but as the producer I'm the
one<00:02:55.570> who<00:02:55.690> basically<00:02:55.900> takes<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.590> project<00:02:57.010> from

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
one who basically takes the project from

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.460 
one who basically takes the project from
nothing<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> something<00:02:58.050> believe<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.320> not

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
nothing to something believe it or not

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.740

idea of some sort of Minecraft game show
the<00:03:51.610> NOx<00:03:51.820> crew<00:03:52.060> was<00:03:52.209> already<00:03:52.540> quite<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.840> tight

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the NOx crew was already quite a tight

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.680 
the NOx crew was already quite a tight
little<00:03:53.470> community<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.310> one<00:03:54.940> year<00:03:55.150> later<00:03:55.180> it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
little community and one year later it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.479 
little community and one year later it
still<00:03:55.930> feels<00:03:56.200> like<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.440> wonderful<00:03:56.860> family<00:03:57.340> we

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
still feels like the wonderful family we

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.160 
still feels like the wonderful family we
always<00:03:57.700> were<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.330> that's<00:03:58.540> one<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> most

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
always were and that's one of the most

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.960 
always were and that's one of the most
important<00:03:59.650> aspects<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.280> creating<00:04:00.519> such<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
important aspects of creating such a

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.850 
important aspects of creating such a
thing<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.870> everyone<00:04:02.200> respects<00:04:02.800> each

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
thing is that everyone respects each

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.280 
thing is that everyone respects each
other<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.310> has<00:04:03.459> their<00:04:03.700> own<00:04:03.820> roles<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.450> won't<00:04:05.170> go

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
other and has their own roles I won't go

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.140 
other and has their own roles I won't go
into<00:04:05.470> talking<00:04:05.800> about<00:04:06.010> how<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.459> NOx<00:04:06.790> who<00:04:06.940> came

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
into talking about how the NOx who came

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.270 
into talking about how the NOx who came
about<00:04:07.420> because<00:04:08.019> that's<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.530> whole<00:04:08.680> other<00:04:08.739> story

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280

about because that's a whole other story
that's<00:04:09.640> probably<00:04:10.150> more<00:04:10.360> appropriate<00:04:10.989> for

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
that's probably more appropriate for

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.380 
that's probably more appropriate for

some sort of hundred K video if we ever
get<00:04:13.600> that<00:04:13.750> far<00:04:14.019> but<00:04:14.620> I'll<00:04:14.769> just<00:04:14.980> leave<00:04:15.190> that

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.159 
get that far but I'll just leave that
that<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.030> NOx<00:04:16.239> crew<00:04:16.479> is<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.630> very<00:04:16.870> tight

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
that that the NOx crew is a very tight

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
of things just don't instantly come to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.070

mind<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:34.250> takes<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.610> bit<00:05:34.760> of<00:05:34.880> cooking<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.479> the

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
mind it takes a bit of cooking and the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.780 
mind it takes a bit of cooking and the
fine<00:05:36.260> idea<00:05:36.650> finally<00:05:37.040> came<00:05:37.370> out<00:05:37.520> of<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.700> oven

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
fine idea finally came out of the oven

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.690 
fine idea finally came out of the oven
so<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:39.110> grew<00:05:39.410> up<00:05:39.440> watching<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:40.130> lot<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.310> varied
