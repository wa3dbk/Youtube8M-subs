it is a big phone but there may be a the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.190 
it is a big phone but there may be a the
puzzle<00:01:10.390> small

puzzle small

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.749 
puzzle small
and<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:11.770> actually<00:01:11.920> seemed<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.490> lot<00:01:12.729> more

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and it's actually seemed a lot more

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.060 
and it's actually seemed a lot more
manageable<00:01:13.119> than<00:01:13.420> your<00:01:13.750> face<00:01:13.990> I'm<00:01:14.680> just<00:01:14.920> let

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
manageable than your face I'm just let

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.310 
manageable than your face I'm just let
the<00:01:15.189> Galaxy<00:01:16.119> Nexus<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.170> it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
the Galaxy Nexus right to it and it's

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
the Galaxy Nexus right to it and it's
actually<00:01:17.890> only<00:01:18.750> marginally<00:01:20.340> bigger<00:01:21.340> than<00:01:21.610> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
actually only marginally bigger than the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.040 
actually only marginally bigger than the
galaxy

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.810 

so<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.800> actually<00:01:25.950> works<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.700> well

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.450 
it's on top here but it has a nice
little<00:02:44.300> touch<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.810> symmetry<00:02:45.230> which<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:46.070> really

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
little touch of symmetry which we really

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.460 
little touch of symmetry which we really
do<00:02:46.610> appreciate<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.840> back<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.200> made<00:02:48.350> of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
do appreciate the back is made of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.640 
do appreciate the back is made of
plastic<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:48.980> has<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> very<00:02:49.580> nice<00:02:50.560> kind<00:02:51.560> of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
plastic but has a very nice kind of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.530 
plastic but has a very nice kind of
brushed<00:02:51.950> metal<00:02:52.340> look<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:53.420> actually

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
brushed metal look to it that actually

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.140 
brushed metal look to it that actually
feels<00:02:53.870> still<00:02:54.410> feels<00:02:54.650> great<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:54.950> hair<00:02:55.160> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
feels still feels great in the hair this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.840 
feels still feels great in the hair this
was<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.390> pebble<00:02:57.110> blue<00:02:57.350> version<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.640> there's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
was the pebble blue version and there's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.900 
was the pebble blue version and there's
also<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.260> white<00:03:00.260> version<00:03:00.470> that's<00:03:00.860> out<00:03:01.100> floating

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
also a white version that's out floating

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.020 
also a white version that's out floating
around<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.300> well

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
around as well

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.650 
around as well
this<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.140> solid<00:03:05.620> foam<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:07.000> think<00:03:07.510> it's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
this is a solid foam that I think it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.720 
this is a solid foam that I think it's
going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> make<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:08.020> lot<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.260> people<00:03:08.590> happen<00:03:08.890> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
going to make a lot of people happen and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.550 
going to make a lot of people happen and
that<00:03:10.240> was<00:03:10.390> at<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.569> quick<00:03:10.870> look<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.230> we'll

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that was at the quick look and we'll

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.420 
that was at the quick look and we'll
have<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.160> free<00:03:12.400> soon<00:03:12.610> thanks<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.150> watching
