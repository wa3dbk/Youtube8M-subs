which<00:03:02.150> i<00:03:02.330> think<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.690> pretty<00:03:02.930> bad<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:04.040> could

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
which i think is pretty bad you could

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.860 
which i think is pretty bad you could
get<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.640> girl<00:03:05.000> book<00:03:05.209> with<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> same<00:03:05.599> amount<00:03:05.750> of

get a girl book with the same amount of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
power even with a bigger screen but a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.110 
power even with a bigger screen but a
lot<00:03:08.300> less<00:03:08.560> maybe<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:10.250> because<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:11.000> also

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
lot less maybe it's because you can also

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.420 
lot less maybe it's because you can also
buy<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.420> computer<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:12.050> Windows<00:03:12.470> which<00:03:13.250> I

buy this computer with Windows which I

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.710 
buy this computer with Windows which I
would<00:03:13.610> take<00:03:13.790> Windows<00:03:14.090> over<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.360> Chrome<00:03:14.569> OS

all I think this is the pretty only
price<00:03:27.890> computer<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.670> there's<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.970> lot<00:03:29.150> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
price computer and there's a lot of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.210 
price computer and there's a lot of
achievement<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.900> business<00:03:30.680> solutions<00:03:31.100> of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
achievement and business solutions of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.070 
achievement and business solutions of
this<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.000> if<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.180> do<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> same<00:03:32.690> thing<00:03:32.870> at<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
this but if you do the same thing at the
