00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is real tricky to dye leather because

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
is real tricky to dye leather because
when<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.170> leathers<00:01:37.470> comes<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> factory

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
when the leathers comes on the factory

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
when the leathers comes on the factory
has<00:01:38.670> already<00:01:38.970> been<00:01:39.110> dyed<00:01:40.110> basically<00:01:40.740> even<00:01:40.920> if

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
has already been dyed basically even if

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.910 
has already been dyed basically even if
it's<00:01:41.189> 10<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.820> been<00:01:42.000> treated<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.439> lot<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it's 10 it's been treated so a lot of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.760 
it's 10 it's been treated so a lot of
lows<00:01:44.159> won't<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> dive<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.320> I'm<00:01:46.320> gonna

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
lows won't take a dive and I'm gonna

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
lows won't take a dive and I'm gonna
make<00:01:46.979> an<00:01:47.189> appeal<00:01:47.490> please<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.360> die<00:01:48.659> your

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you can't see and that you're not afraid

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
you can't see and that you're not afraid
to<00:01:57.840> mess<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> might<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.159> work

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
to mess up because it might not work

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.490 
to mess up because it might not work
this<00:02:00.000> fellow<00:02:00.299> also<00:02:00.450> sent<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.049> another<00:02:01.229> glove

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this fellow also sent me another glove

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
this fellow also sent me another glove
that<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.890> black<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.430> tan

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that was black and tan

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
that was black and tan
and<00:02:03.000> he<00:02:03.119> asked<00:02:03.329> me<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> dye<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> 10-part<00:02:05.070> black

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and he asked me to dye the 10-part black

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.029 
and he asked me to dye the 10-part black
so<00:02:05.549> it'd<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.789> hopeful<00:02:06.180> an<00:02:06.240> entirely<00:02:06.539> black

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
so it'd be hopeful an entirely black

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.290 
so it'd be hopeful an entirely black
tried<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> tan<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.880> wouldn't<00:02:09.149> take

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
tried it and the tan just wouldn't take

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.790 
tried it and the tan just wouldn't take
it<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> did<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.560> spot<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it so I did it a little spot that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860 
it so I did it a little spot that
wouldn't<00:02:11.430> show<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> didn't<00:02:12.420> take<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
wouldn't show if it didn't take and it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
wouldn't show if it didn't take and it
didn't<00:02:13.200> take<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> told<00:02:14.640> him<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.880> couldn't

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
didn't take so I told him I couldn't

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.120 
didn't take so I told him I couldn't
couldn't<00:02:15.540> help<00:02:15.750> them<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.200> one<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:17.099> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
couldn't help them with that one so I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.309 
couldn't help them with that one so I
