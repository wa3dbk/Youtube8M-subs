00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540
 Hey 

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.910
 There is a parasitic animal in the newly started animation after the other one and the parasitic animal is not expecting at all 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.980
 It's usually interesting also I was 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:22.820
 It would be what in the Tteyuu part second place interesting in this case is 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:26.740
 Is doing by carefully carefully episode that fun the feeling that does not bend to have the original 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.180
 Do it Well good to 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:37.360
 I think it's fun to look at JoJo's Nerd Part 1 and Part 2 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:43.210
 What is interesting is that the original is interesting, but what about the original 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.730
 It is a work that is not white when it is made to animate and move even if it 's regulated or gradually 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.790
 Have up to a perfectly interesting level it Kedomo 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.010
 I thought it was a big deal for the staff because I was alive 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.640
 Jojo's Cat 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.980
 A little vibration from the third part 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.600
 I towards the anime version is brought to Tteyuu fun of the original is still more and more sweet author 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.320
 It will be a little artistic 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.950
 If so, so-called part 1 part is still conveyed in animation 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.030
 Kedomo I'm coming by to say so Toka write with you if say words decided 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.920
 The other voice actor makes a beautiful voice 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 Package and the balance from the third parts per Kedomo I is transmitted to cool in the place to say words 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 Is already so difficult that how to express the stand 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.540
 If it is so-called relieved, it is already 4 vs 4 after the same drum as Saint Seiya and Kakin Kinman. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 It will be a battle thing 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:38.289
 So normally result in animation and part and has become unexpectedly to normal anime 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 The hero who has 2 parts is included and the story is intensely par, and the final enemy is also 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:46.960
 I was unable to see too much the sense of tension that I was always nearby 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.380
 Even during the homecoming in the animation of Part 3 Pure Land theory 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.409
 That 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.020
 If you do so long, you will be the one 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 Because it is a story that is originally not so long, I ran through to the last as it is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.549
 I wonder if I can't afford it 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.030
 I'm pretty much expecting you this time 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.380
 That's next week 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.380
 If you are a manga artist, you should do it, but you will laugh next week and maybe you'll run out of news 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:17.080
 I'm just back from New York 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:22.060
 Hi everybody Da' Tsu and try or blog bathing the Holy Spirit Rupude 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:30.480
 It feels like a head I think I will start 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 If it is decided that it is the beginning from such a strange neighborhood with 5 i love Toioka 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:41.849
 It is 2 thing that youkai watch was good and that it was good during homecoming 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.819
 I went to the next week's notice, so today is eh 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.840
 Tomo also 30 minutes I got up half 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.340
 It is today 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.860
 It is finished in 9:00 back as soon as possible to Kichijoji and prepare to go to the United States 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:02.260
 Limited broadcast is around 9 o'clock, and there is around 30 minutes. 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.890
 Because I have not thought about the broadcast material at all in the matter at all , one of the things I do in this time is one 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.160
 is not it 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.830
 It is a thing called a cyber brain rescue team foundation 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.720
 that 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.920
 It 's so abundant because I started playing it, so I'm going to say that in a rather complicated tone 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.510
 I bet that Why do you think? 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:22.340
 I 'm talking to people who are watching Nico, of course, but the ones I'm shooting from now are also small later 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.819
 Maybe it 's cut off here on youtube . 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:32.209
 What's so weird about this now because it will be used as an introductory video 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.069
 I think it is not good to say that my uncle 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.410
 so 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:41.380
 Well it will be explained from the concept 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:44.710
 tone The state of the cyber rescue team is true It is said that the international rescue team is straight 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.740
 It is a large assist-class state I wanted to N Thunderbird to 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:54.740
 Can not be used down because it seems to do also taken various rights 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:57.920
 So I can not use it in the international rescue team, so I tried to call it the name I want to play a game 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.090
 I think that now you can shut up what you can do later on youtube 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.510
 It's in vain at the time of entering Do'm making a video editing point 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.510
 So I guess because in silence that fool now about three seconds
