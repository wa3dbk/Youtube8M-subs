here<00:01:49.329> I<00:01:49.360> also<00:01:49.630> learn<00:01:49.990> how<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
here I also learn how to because of the

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.460 
here I also learn how to because of the
first<00:01:53.350> days<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.590> German<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.579> then<00:01:54.819> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
first days the German and then the

first days the German and then the
standard<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.590> surfing<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:57.849> the<00:01:57.970> people<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.750> met

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
standard of surfing and the people I met

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.419 
standard of surfing and the people I met
here<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.739> quite<00:02:00.099> different<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.390> what<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:03.009> find

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
here is quite different so what I find

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.000 
here is quite different so what I find
is<00:02:03.520> quite<00:02:03.579> useful
