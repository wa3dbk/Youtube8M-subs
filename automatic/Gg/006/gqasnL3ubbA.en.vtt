00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.519
 very good youtube be ricky johns and 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.670
 I'm here to present the video of 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.950
 My transformation has been about 5 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.590
 minutes of video a little less or 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.869
 better four minutes summarizing my 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.669
 transformation over three years 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.349
 ok since I'm going to put some 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.840
 pictures of before starting the gym for 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.050
 that you see the genetics that I had before 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.510
 to start and then for three years 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.489
 they will be putting pictures of some video of 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.160
 what's'm still my 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.700
 transformation and post keeps saying 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.530
 the stages you go through is not worth it 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.180
 that at the beginning it was a genetic 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.880
 this extreme form is worth as you see here 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.150
 he was very thin 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.400
 here I thought only 65 kilos this is 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.530
 in the year 2011 how will I go putting 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.690
 also the weight and the year is worth the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.610
 egg for you to be placing here 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.560
 I was still far from having started 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.530
 gym is worth as you see it was very 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.240
 slim here generating 2012 I started the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.310
 gym these are the three months are going to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.270
 start assigning them climbed 68 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.300
 kilos and well then I was advancing little 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.120
 shortly after I went to live in states 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.250
 united is worth a few months there was not going very 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.500
 assiduously because he worked a lot 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.660
 alone then I would go over with some 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.790
 four days a week but well so 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 I started eating more as you see here 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.200
 I was going up 70 kilos, it's worth noticing the 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.020
 Weight gain especially the truth 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 food 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 to junk food and lots of food and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 well here I started also as you see 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 here in this picture with my partner 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 room we had some first 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.740
 contacts with protein shakes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.450
 once I returned here to Spain and I 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.750
 I started to take it more seriously I went up as 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.969
 You see in 2013 at 72 kilos already started 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.469
 focus a bit more on what 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.869
 I needed to start going more as you see 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.179
 they started taking the results already 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.130
 being about five days a week and 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.110
 doing all the exercise well not all 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.319
 the muscles changing I started to vary 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.549
 the exercises already know how you see here 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.730
 changes going up 74 kilos and well 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.519
 I started to see better my confidence went up 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.079
 with the gym and he started me 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.540
 Like much more here as you see 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.690
 I came to weigh at the end of 2013 this 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 it would be summer of 2013 reaches 79 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.430
 kilos that for me at the beginning was was 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.350
 practically impossible I imagined that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.480
 I would arrive here 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.510
 so then good here a video a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.950
 little that says because it does just two 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.720
 years 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.129
 As you can see, it was quite noticeable 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.910
 fitness center 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.470
 I ate better I was taking supplementation 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.660
 carbohydrate shakes here in this 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.300
 right moment I would be taking the jumbo 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.040
 I retaliated that it was good for me to do well 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.340
 to gain weight to me specifically 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.569
 because I have very little fat but I will give 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.290
 another video talking about supplementation 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.519
 OK 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.769
 then these are videos of it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.930
 Summer even allows me as you see 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.480
 define a little to mark more 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.900
 abdominals and so on and then here 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.099
 came a fall worth in 2014 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.629
 I lost almost 89 kilos because of problems 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.599
 personal we all have then 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.220
 so you can see that you can fall and then 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.590
 here I started to win again it's worth 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.819
 end of 2014 good to see before 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.859
 from the summer of 2014 I went up again to 78 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.709
 kilos as you see the back already more 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.530
 formed much more formed and good then 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.310
 so far in 2015 where where I've 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.300
 come to weigh 85 kilos is worth as you see 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.030
 already much better than in the previous stage 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.670
 and because nothing current is worth right now 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.600
 lowered a little weight by summer 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.040
 holidays 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.810
 83 kilos 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.610
 and well then a bit how you have 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.219
 different information tell me a bit my 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.379
 and what objective in mind of 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.390
 this channel is not worth the same 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.799
 then recover those 23 kilos that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.189
 we were losing vacation until the day of 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.890
 again at 85 86 that was the weight of 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.680
 summer customers 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.480
 and then from September start 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.970
 a stage or try a stage of 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.480
 quite aggressive volume or until you get 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.210
 to the idea is to overcome 90 even 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.880
 You can reach 95 at the best for 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.830
 may 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.300
 and there then to be able to allow one to make a 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.400
 longer definition of those that go 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.400
 to get the most results 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.150
 yes
