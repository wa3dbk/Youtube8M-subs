00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:06.319
 good evening everyone and welcome to 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.330
 the workshop of rcc or tonight we will 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.389
 to watch finally I would say because there has been 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.580
 a few months apart between the video of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.230
 measures before cursed stop it and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 now we are going to have the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.529
 measurement results after modify it's 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.210
 Besides, it is not the same ts 590 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.810
 san is another that's the reason for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.900
 which lighting and green 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.789
 that being said so was saying the suspense 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.469
 is at its peak so I'm always 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:40.769
 on 20 m the micro tavern at 50% and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.409
 I use the microphone brings type of origin 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.959
 the compressor is not engaged I 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.510
 am always with my faithful daiwa cn 

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:53.489
 800 hand on the caliber of 100 watts 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 the caliber of the middle well so we're going 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.649
 see a little bit what that gives then 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.979
 so I'm sure khalife of 100 watts and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 we see that speaking normally in the 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 micro I still have 30 42 watts 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 modulate what do you remember and when 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.159
 even more than heroes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.399
 wadding of 3 watts watou 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.259
 modulated config from elsewhere 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.929
 remember I had been forced under 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.789
 calibrated that is to say to fall on the 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.969
 20- watt gauge the smallest gauge 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:31.149
 and I'm going to do the same thing again with 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:35.020
 the new settings so 1,2 and that's 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.469
 of modulation Monday Tuesday and Wednesday 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 so we see that actually it's 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.359
 much more than heroes then you go 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 tell me yes but what is the power 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.090
 maximum obtained now well I 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.560
 goes into effect on the hand I stretch 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.530
 caliber of the mediums the caliber of 100 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:00.879
 watts so on vm I get 120 watts 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.939
 120 watts on vm 125 watts on 3.5 and 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.469
 110 watts on 10 m which makes that like 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.659
 usually and this is the most 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.250
 great difficulty 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.530
 I managed to work well on the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.349
 girl winner without overflowing on the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.970
 maxi that's because we stay in 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.500
 acceptable and reasonable limits 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 especially for the chord box and then 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.940
 not to mention the extraordinary 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.049
 potential for power dairy products ago 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.840
 still two rd 100 mitsubichi forgiveness 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.060
 here and here who are capable of 100 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.069
 watts each so it should be noted that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.840
 all this device and it's partly a 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.819
 explanations of the gap 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.730
 if you look at the architect of the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.069
 pea so you have r &amp; d without matthew 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.620
 mitcham push-pull who arrived by 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.120
 one RD16 which is itself driven 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.549
 by a rer d 05 then compared to the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.169
 traditional camping all brands 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.060
 confused since anyway all 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.500
 the manufacturers use the same semi 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.519
 drivers now well we 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.540
 realizes that on ts 590 cameroon has 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.060
 chose to put only one rd16 there 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
 where other manufacturers and even she 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.720
 gives us on the other models of the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.879
 range but I still have a push pull 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.530
 that is to say 2 transistors so there we 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.109
 would be tempted to say that already he is missing 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.549
 3 db in terms of power we'll say 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.030
 compared to usual 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.610
 here 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.790
 but hey it's a beginning of explanation and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.620
 believe me the explanation is 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.970
 elsewhere 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.110
 and anyway there is not only one 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 only explanation to answer for this 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.550
 terrible power gaps from elsewhere 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.270
 all makes and models combined 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.190
 I think that we are dealing with the most 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.340
 large gaps observed in terms of 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.750
 power currently 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.280
 so here I am going to do you now 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.160
 For the beauty of the gesture 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.690
 I'm going back to usb, I'll make you 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.300
 measurements with the compressor of 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.459
 modulation then the compressor the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.970
 processor it is set to 40 and the 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.819
 processor out to 60 still microarn 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.090
 so is hey I'll put it to you 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.880
 modulation course it will be better so 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.860
 here I am again a ssb so here I do not have the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.220
 modulation compressor I'm going 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.530
 now engage it see see 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.500
 here is the compressor is engaged and we 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.650
 realize that there now I burn 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.620
 about 60 70 watts with even some 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.750
 spikes at 80 watts 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.490
 here and look at the measuring device 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.620
 so yes and it is obvious that the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.620
 reading one and know it after modifs is 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.940
 wrong but it's clean to almost 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.450
 all devices all brands 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.930
 confused also here is all this 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.210
 to say that the apparatus once more 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.690
 in the normality I would say with some 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.289
 results quite equivalent to his 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.539
 counterparts 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.940
 that is to say and we will say a 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.970
 fifty wet modulate and a good 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.250
 hundred watts in peak of 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.690
 modulation on the carrier mode because I 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.850
 you remember the original measures it 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.729
 was quite deplorable I invite you 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.560
 to watch the video of 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.940
 measures before modifs rcc I you 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.330
 remember the numbers it was grosso 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.909
 modo 88 max in women and men and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.620
 two three four modules and maximum 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.240
 with or without modulation compressor 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.509
 our orders besides it makes a 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.819
 general outcry on the different forums 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.680
 and other websites 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.949
 I thank you for following me 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.509
 and listened yes last thing so to 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.099
 plain language we won more than 10 db 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.810
 denounced as if we had put a 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.479
 amplifier behind while we 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.370
 always use the same post 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.349
 here are the friends I wish you a 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.240
 good day and thank you 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.460
 to have listened to me very soon for 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.460
 new adventures in the workshop 2 rcc
