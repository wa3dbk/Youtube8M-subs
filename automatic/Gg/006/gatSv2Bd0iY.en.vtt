00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
trying to shoot down your kill stretch

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
trying to shoot down your kill stretch
your<00:01:43.259> low<00:01:43.409> star<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.549> warbird<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> stuff

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
your low star or your warbird and stuff

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.030 
your low star or your warbird and stuff
like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:46.200> dogs<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> ground

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
like that your dogs are on the ground

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380 
like that your dogs are on the ground
killing<00:01:47.399> those<00:01:47.610> people<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> are<00:01:48.119> standing

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
killing those people that are standing

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.520 
killing those people that are standing
still<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> people<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:48.990> standing<00:01:49.320> still

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
still the people that are standing still

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
still the people that are standing still
are<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> easiest<00:01:50.070> targets<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> dogs<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
are the easiest targets for the dogs to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
are the easiest targets for the dogs to
attack<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.290> promotes<00:01:52.710> great<00:01:53.130> great

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
attack so this just promotes great great

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
attack so this just promotes great great
great<00:01:54.240> synergy<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.009> alone<00:01:56.490> I'm

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
great synergy and it's just alone I'm

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.920 
great synergy and it's just alone I'm
just<00:01:56.969> saying<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> best<00:01:57.479> kill<00:01:57.659> streak<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just saying it's the best kill streak in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
just saying it's the best kill streak in
the<00:01:58.020> game<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> inside<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the game because they can go inside a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039 
the game because they can go inside a
building<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.060> kill<00:02:00.270> those<00:02:00.390> motherfuckers<00:02:00.570> in

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
building and kill those motherfuckers in

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.859 
building and kill those motherfuckers in
a<00:02:01.229> building<00:02:01.909> now<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.450> call<00:02:03.689> duty

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
a building now I think with call duty

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.940 
a building now I think with call duty
ghosts<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> call<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.500> duty<00:02:04.680> advanced<00:02:04.860> warfare

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
ghosts and call of duty advanced warfare

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.429 
ghosts and call of duty advanced warfare
we<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.490> no<00:02:05.640> killstreaks<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
we have no killstreaks like that that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.650 
we have no killstreaks like that that
are<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:08.280> optional<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> only<00:02:09.360> kill

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
are like optional like the only kill

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.690 
are like optional like the only kill
streak<00:02:09.869> i<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.739> kills<00:02:10.950> everybody<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
streak i think that kills everybody is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.410 
streak i think that kills everybody is
like

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
like

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.900 
like
yeah<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:13.020> advanced<00:02:13.380> warfare<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.760> one

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
yeah in advanced warfare is the the one

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.250 
yeah in advanced warfare is the the one
on<00:02:15.090> come<00:02:15.510> back<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:15.990> what<00:02:16.110> it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
on come back I don't know what it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410 
on come back I don't know what it's
called<00:02:16.349> but<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.670> support<00:02:18.209> care

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
called but you get it out a support care

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.699 
called but you get it out a support care
package<00:02:18.810> which<00:02:18.989> makes<00:02:19.200> absolutely<00:02:19.380> no<00:02:19.620> sense

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
package which makes absolutely no sense

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.800 
package which makes absolutely no sense
it<00:02:20.160> targets<00:02:20.580> everybody<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.390> map<00:02:21.569> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it targets everybody on the map and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.750 
it targets everybody on the map and
nobody's<00:02:22.260> safe<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.920> feel<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> every<00:02:23.580> call

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
nobody's safe and I feel like every call

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.820 
nobody's safe and I feel like every call
of<00:02:23.849> duty<00:02:24.030> needs<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> killstreak<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.380> targets

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
of duty needs a killstreak that targets

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.040 
of duty needs a killstreak that targets
everybody<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.970> all<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.690> he<00:02:27.810> doesn't

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
everybody and not just all if he doesn't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.570 
everybody and not just all if he doesn't
have<00:02:28.140> blind<00:02:28.349> eye<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> okay<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.280> attack<00:02:29.550> him

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
have blind eye on okay I can attack him

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.949 
have blind eye on okay I can attack him
because<00:02:29.910> he<00:02:30.030> doesn't<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.300> blind<00:02:30.540> eye<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.720> you

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
because he doesn't have blind eye on you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.360 
because he doesn't have blind eye on you
don't<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.200> mean<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> think<00:02:31.950> that's<00:02:32.160> why

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
don't I mean so I think that's why

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.360 
don't I mean so I think that's why
attack<00:02:32.790> dogs<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.300> probably<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> best<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
attack dogs or probably the best the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.070 
attack dogs or probably the best the
best<00:02:35.400> kill<00:02:35.819> streak<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> game<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.750> because

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
best kill streak in the game is because

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.140 
best kill streak in the game is because
that<00:02:37.440> they<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:37.800> after<00:02:37.980> everybody<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:39.000> go

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
that they go after everybody they go

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.790 
that they go after everybody they go
after<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.510> people<00:02:39.660> standing<00:02:40.019> still<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.530> do

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
after the people standing still just do

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.320 
after the people standing still just do
that<00:02:40.980> stands<00:02:41.220> taller<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.640> easiest<00:02:42.000> targets

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
that stands taller the easiest targets

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.270 
that stands taller the easiest targets
also<00:02:43.140> when<00:02:43.440> you're<00:02:43.530> running<00:02:43.739> around<00:02:44.099> running

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
also when you're running around running

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.920 
also when you're running around running
and<00:02:44.580> gunning<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.940> attack<00:02:45.450> dogs<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and gunning with attack dogs on the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.270 
and gunning with attack dogs on the
ground<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.260> lot<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> players<00:02:46.920> you're<00:02:47.130> just

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
ground a lot of the players you're just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.040 
ground a lot of the players you're just
shooting<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> dogs<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.870> makes

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
shooting at the dogs and it just makes

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.720 
shooting at the dogs and it just makes
it<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.260> much<00:02:49.530> easier<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:50.069> kill<00:02:50.220> them<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.580> not

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it that much easier to kill them so not

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.190 
it that much easier to kill them so not
only<00:02:50.910> does<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.239> synchronize<00:02:51.720> wolf<00:02:51.959> kill

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
only does it synchronize wolf kill

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.140 
only does it synchronize wolf kill
streaks<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.950> allows<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.459> run<00:02:53.580> again<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.970> lot

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
streaks it allows you to run again a lot

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.000 
streaks it allows you to run again a lot
better<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:55.080> kills<00:02:55.290> those<00:02:55.410> campers<00:02:55.830> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
better and it kills those campers it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.890 
better and it kills those campers it
clears<00:02:56.280> outbuildings<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.660> actually

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
clears outbuildings and you can actually

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.479 
clears outbuildings and you can actually
just<00:02:58.290> start<00:02:58.560> spawn<00:02:58.769> killing<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.190> shit<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.459> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
just start spawn killing the shit out of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.449 
are number one on the list probably
swarm<00:03:09.569> being<00:03:09.780> second<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:10.920> mean<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459
