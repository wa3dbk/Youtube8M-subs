00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.980
 for me 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 well I thank God this little one 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.050
 I have a family that are many men 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.540
 had enough cousins ​​then always 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.259
 that there was a family reunion 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.150
 we were playing soccer all that is with 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.980
 a bottle with a cardboard with 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.020
 with a ball with whatever we were 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.030
 all playing and I think since 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.370
 we were very small we liked it very much 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.820
 soccer 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 then I had the opportunity that my 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.140
 parents took me to a school of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.089
 football at 5 years old and there I started to be 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.899
 goalkeeper that I liked to be goalkeeper and 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.780
 Well it was worth it if we played in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.089
 where anywhere in the corridor 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.839
 from the house on the street where outside with 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.360
 what we put a two small courts 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.489
 with stones and if there was a bottle for 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 to play was with a bottle or with 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.990
 balls with what was always was 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.500
 something we liked and that fills us with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 happiness my mom always tells me and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.759
 I half remember a bit about the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.100
 first day I went to kindergarten and 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.119
 we say to the school each one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.119
 to kindergarten 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.450
 she tells me to come to the house and 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.049
 when she saw me she stayed like that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.080
 happened to him and says that I arrived with had 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.740
 painted balls on the face on the shirt 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.409
 the dirty shoes the stockings everything and I 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.299
 I remember what 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.299
 the recesses what he did was play 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.759
 football and it was always something that called me 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.679
 a lot of attention and I did not care 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.359
 where it was or whatever it was that 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.579
 whenever there was a ball or something with 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.219
 what to play and who to play with always 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.219
 We would play if I think that always 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.259
 it is important that all of us 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.170
 parents is to be able to inculcate them 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.980
 the necessary values ​​to our children 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.080
 and while it is true 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.400
 give him the opportunity to do the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 sports they like in that case 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.880
 we are talking about football that was what 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.340
 as I am always struck me 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.380
 but this any sport is always 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.630
 important because they are going to be 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.700
 responsible will have many values 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.640
 who will also learn to live together 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.490
 with other people and all that helps you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.520
 one to be a better person and I think that 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.700
 it is also something that is extremely this 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.510
 good in this aspect is that this one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.460
 as a child, he distances him from bad paths 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.660
 and it drives him away from drugs and all the 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.060
 things that one can find in the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 street and that's always good I was 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.970
 in a football school from 5 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.610
 years 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.980
 and I was always a goalkeeper from school 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 of soccer but when I played on the street 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 on the court of my neighborhood with my cousins 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.850
 I was never a goalkeeper, there's no forward now 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 and I was I was a porter in the serious and 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.690
 up to date when it's kidding I do not 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.050
 I do not get doorman all step 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.840
 days 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.450
 forward to the fun yes that's 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.080
 very important because this one learns to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.910
 living healthily does sport is done 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520
 responsible to learn to respect the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.130
 others learn to get along with others 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.870
 children that in the end all the people 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.379
 we have different personalities 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.110
 and the things we're going to do during the 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.420
 day and our thoughts are going to go 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.299
 guiding us into a healthier life and we 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.940
 they will take away from many things that we 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.909
 we can find on the road and that 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.739
 we can learn to say no at all 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.430
 the senses I think it's never 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.930
 more to improve in any field that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.110
 we are at the best in costa rica if you are 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.240
 all right 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.460
 in education but children to the best 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.380
 does not do much sport or whatever in 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.640
 anything I believe that in what 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.290
 we want to help in whatever we want 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.630
 provide parents with all the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.590
 societies children there are many children 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.330
 that maybe this one does not have that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.120
 those possibilities of being able to do some 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.220
 sport and that's where there are talents that 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.050
 you can lose many people can 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.240
 help for that child to fulfill his 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.890
 dream and be able to become a great 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.110
 footballer I think those things there 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.600
 to take them into account and think about what 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.060
 we can help many children if I 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.820
 I always try to be a good example myself 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.200
 I believe that all human beings 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.450
 we make mistakes in our life but 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.460
 I always ask God to help me 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.790
 have humility and that discernment for 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.210
 to have a good way and to this 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.950
 will help children create in their 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.340
 capabilities and can become 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.340
 great footballers
