00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I've opened here a post that I did about

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.890 
I've opened here a post that I did about
crossing<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> border<00:00:15.000> between<00:00:15.150> costa<00:00:15.690> rica

crossing the border between costa rica
and<00:00:15.929> panama<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:18.109> if<00:00:19.109> you're<00:00:19.320> crossing<00:00:19.740> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

and panama and if you're crossing that
border<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.430> story<00:00:21.090> itself<00:00:21.480> might<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.900> useful

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
border the story itself might be useful

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.410 
border the story itself might be useful
but<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.670> useful<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
but would be really useful is if you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.750 
but would be really useful is if you
could<00:00:24.570> take<00:00:24.779> these<00:00:24.990> points<00:00:25.740> throw<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.609> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
could take these points throw them on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.560 
could take these points throw them on
your<00:00:26.910> phone<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.689> iPad<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.460> take<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
your phone or your iPad and take this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.350 
your phone or your iPad and take this
file<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.309> GPS<00:00:32.880> uomo
