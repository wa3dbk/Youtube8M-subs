00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
moment is sort of a series of images

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.049 
moment is sort of a series of images
that<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.340> working<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that I'm working on

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
that I'm working on
coinciding<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.870> articles<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.859> have<00:00:46.980> been

coinciding with articles that have been

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.479 
coinciding with articles that have been
in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> news<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.910> Mexico<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
in the news about Mexico and the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.790 
in the news about Mexico and the
violence<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.760> happening<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.329> like

violence that's happening there like

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
violence that's happening there like
regarding<00:00:52.800> drug<00:00:53.129> cartels<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.879> groups

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
regarding drug cartels and groups

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
regarding drug cartels and groups
I'm<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.930> working<00:00:55.140> sort<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> stories

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I'm just working sort of as the stories

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
I'm just working sort of as the stories
come<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.210> something<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.109> really

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
come out so something I can get really

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.360 
come out so something I can get really
absorbed<00:00:58.890> in

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
absorbed in

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.540 
absorbed in
I<00:01:00.840> find<00:01:01.840> water-cooler<00:01:02.590> quite<00:01:02.800> unique<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.400> use

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
I find water-cooler quite unique to use

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.700 
I find water-cooler quite unique to use
because<00:01:03.940> it's<00:01:04.150> water-based<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.260> often<00:01:05.560> I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
because it's water-based and often I'm

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.430 
because it's water-based and often I'm
using<00:01:05.920> paper<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.580> has<00:01:06.850> some<00:01:07.140> oil-based<00:01:08.140> ink

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
using paper that has some oil-based ink

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.810 
using paper that has some oil-based ink
on<00:01:08.620> it<00:01:08.650> already<00:01:09.100> from<00:01:09.340> Blatter<00:01:09.550> press

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
on it already from Blatter press

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.890 
on it already from Blatter press
techniques<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.880> often<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.420> newsprint

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
techniques I use it often on newsprint

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.300 
techniques I use it often on newsprint
because<00:01:14.229> that's<00:01:14.410> sometimes<00:01:14.620> what<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:15.220> to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
because that's sometimes what I like to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.250 
because that's sometimes what I like to
press<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.640> topic<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.660> like<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> way<00:01:17.080> it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
press on topic and I like the way it

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.080 
press on topic and I like the way it
soaks<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.830> because<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.460> newsprint<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:18.910> so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
soaks in because the newsprint is so

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.719 
soaks in because the newsprint is so
porous<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.810> quite<00:01:20.020> thin<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:21.369> like<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.640> way

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
porous and quite thin and I like the way

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.490 
porous and quite thin and I like the way
that<00:01:21.940> when<00:01:22.119> I'm<00:01:22.270> using<00:01:22.479> watercolor<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.170> fills

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
that when I'm using watercolor it fills

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.430 
that when I'm using watercolor it fills
in<00:01:23.740> sort<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.460> spaces<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:25.210> aren't<00:01:25.990> taken

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
in sort of the spaces that aren't taken

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.370 
in sort of the spaces that aren't taken
up<00:01:26.560> by<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.770> oil<00:01:27.040> I<00:01:27.690> like<00:01:28.690> using<00:01:28.869> watercolor

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
up by the oil I like using watercolor

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.530 
up by the oil I like using watercolor
because<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:29.890> quite<00:01:30.070> versatile<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.270> find

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
because it's quite versatile and I find

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.139 
because it's quite versatile and I find
that<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:32.260> has<00:01:32.740> quite<00:01:32.979> settled<00:01:33.460> sort<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.850> colors

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
that it has quite settled sort of colors

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.030 
that it has quite settled sort of colors
rather<00:01:34.450> than<00:01:34.750> big<00:01:34.960> strong<00:01:35.320> pigments<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
rather than big strong pigments that you

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040 
rather than big strong pigments that you
often<00:01:36.369> get<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.700> give<00:01:36.850> out<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.180> things<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.690> if

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
often get to give out and things and if

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.109 
often get to give out and things and if
I'm<00:01:38.200> putting<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.680> on<00:01:38.740> top<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:39.160> textures<00:01:39.820> and

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
I'm putting that on top of textures and

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.359 
I'm putting that on top of textures and
images<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.110> doesn't<00:01:41.619> take<00:01:41.800> over<00:01:41.979> from

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
images and it doesn't take over from

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.120 
images and it doesn't take over from
what's<00:01:42.610> already<00:01:42.729> there<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:47.530> influenced<00:01:48.040> by

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
what's already there I'm influenced by

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.580 
what's already there I'm influenced by
the<00:01:48.850> way<00:01:49.000> traditionally<00:01:49.660> watercolor<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.290> used

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the way traditionally watercolor is used

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.580 
the way traditionally watercolor is used
by<00:01:50.890> lots<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.729> things<00:01:52.210> strokes<00:01:52.810> creating<00:01:53.470> life

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
by lots of things strokes creating life

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.800 
by lots of things strokes creating life
building<00:01:54.039> up<00:01:54.190> texture<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:55.119> use<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.690> in

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
building up texture I use that in

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.510 
building up texture I use that in
backgrounds<00:01:56.410> quite<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.680> lot<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.190> doing<00:01:57.399> the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
backgrounds quite a lot of doing the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.670 
backgrounds quite a lot of doing the
loads<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.910> different<00:01:58.119> layers<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:59.259> create<00:01:59.500> some

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
loads of different layers to create some

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.930 
loads of different layers to create some
depth<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:02.710> looking<00:02:03.220> forward<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.550> seeing<00:02:03.729> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
depth I'm looking forward to seeing the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.210 
depth I'm looking forward to seeing the
exhibition<00:02:04.450> at<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.630> taper<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.220> watercolors

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
some way because they are seen as

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.250 
some way because they are seen as
traditional<00:02:29.800> British<00:02:30.459> medium<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
I think my work would be seen as a a

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.710 
I think my work would be seen as a a
documentation<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:54.130> today's<00:02:54.459> political<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
