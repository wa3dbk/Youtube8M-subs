00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.449 
saw in battlefield 3 it looks like
they're<00:01:33.229> using<00:01:33.560> some<00:01:33.709> of<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> same<00:01:33.920> assets

they're using some of the same assets

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:35.770 
they're using some of the same assets
like<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.700> reload<00:01:34.970> animation<00:01:35.149> looks<00:01:35.539> slightly

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
like the reload animation looks slightly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.419 
like the reload animation looks slightly
similar<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.770> sound<00:01:36.979> effects<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.280> stuff

similar the sound effects and stuff

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.760 
similar the sound effects and stuff
sound<00:01:37.940> pretty<00:01:38.240> new<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.539> improved<00:01:38.899> on<00:01:39.080> but

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
sound pretty new and improved on but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.050 
sound pretty new and improved on but
that<00:01:39.800> reload<00:01:40.280> animation<00:01:40.429> could<00:01:40.910> be

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
that reload animation could be

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.820 
that reload animation could be

at<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.060> point<00:02:59.270> your<00:02:59.450> character<00:02:59.780> pulls<00:03:00.080> out

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
at this point your character pulls out

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.440 
at this point your character pulls out
what<00:03:00.500> looks<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:00.800> be<00:03:00.890> an<00:03:01.100> AK<00:03:01.520> 5<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.210> an

we<00:03:08.030> also<00:03:08.150> saw<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.690> medal<00:03:09.020> of<00:03:09.050> honor<00:03:09.230> warfighter

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
we also saw in medal of honor warfighter

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.260 
we also saw in medal of honor warfighter
and<00:03:10.010> looks<00:03:10.310> slightly<00:03:10.520> similar<00:03:10.820> we've<00:03:11.030> got<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
and looks slightly similar we've got the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.420 
and looks slightly similar we've got the
ACOG<00:03:11.690> four<00:03:12.020> times<00:03:12.290> optical<00:03:12.590> scope<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.220> here

ACOG four times optical scope on here

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.210 
ACOG four times optical scope on here
and<00:03:13.580> also<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.210> 45<00:03:14.690> degree<00:03:14.960> angle<00:03:15.620> iron<00:03:15.860> sights

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
and also the 45 degree angle iron sights

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.560 
and also the 45 degree angle iron sights
that<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.550> can<00:03:16.670> switch<00:03:16.910> between<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.390> two

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
that you can switch between the two

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.360 
that you can switch between the two
which<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.960> pretty<00:03:18.350> awesome<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.830> saw<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.190> in

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
which is pretty awesome we saw that in

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.120 
which is pretty awesome we saw that in
the<00:03:19.400> previous<00:03:19.820> fishing<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.480> baku<00:03:20.630> trailer<00:03:21.200> so

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the jet we just saw slide down the deck

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.940 
the jet we just saw slide down the deck
of<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.840> aircraft<00:03:23.990> carrier<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.650> fall<00:03:24.800> into

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of the aircraft carrier and fall into

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.450 
the water look like an f-18 Super Hornet
and<00:03:27.350> also<00:03:27.830> if<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.980> look<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.280> background

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
on the other aircraft carrier you can

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.140 
on the other aircraft carrier you can
see<00:03:30.350> what<00:03:30.590> looked<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.830> be<00:03:30.920> some<00:03:31.190> Ospreys<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:32.000> on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
see what looked to be some Ospreys up on

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.520 
see what looked to be some Ospreys up on
the<00:03:32.270> deck<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.720> don't<00:03:33.080> know<00:03:33.140> if<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.350> going

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
the deck I don't know if this is going

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.660
