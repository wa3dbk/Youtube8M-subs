otherwise<00:01:45.390> would<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.690> little<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.020> too<00:01:46.110> cold

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
otherwise would be a little bit too cold

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
otherwise would be a little bit too cold
to<00:01:46.500> work<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.040> few<00:01:47.160> months<00:01:47.400> out<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.550> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to work in for a few months out of the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
to work in for a few months out of the
year<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.120> exactly<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:49.200> situation<00:01:49.410> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
year which is exactly the situation that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.890 
year which is exactly the situation that
we<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.520> believe<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.630> cannot

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
we have here so believe me we cannot

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.140 
we have here so believe me we cannot
wait<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.260> fire<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.680> thing<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.150> typically

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
wait to fire this thing up typically

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.850 
wait to fire this thing up typically
we're<00:01:54.390> looking<00:01:54.660> at<00:01:54.810> three<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.290> four<00:01:55.410> hours<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
we're looking at three or four hours and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.860 
we're looking at three or four hours and
for<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.340> basic<00:01:56.730> installation<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
for a basic installation in this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.930 
for a basic installation in this
particular<00:01:58.410> case<00:01:58.650> we've<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:58.950> cement<00:01:59.340> trusses

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
particular case we've got cement trusses

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.820 
particular case we've got cement trusses
so<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.900> do<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.380> figure<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
so what we're gonna do is figure out the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.170 
so what we're gonna do is figure out the
angle<00:02:02.160> we're<00:02:02.250> gonna<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.580> hang<00:02:02.730> this<00:02:02.880> unit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
angle we're gonna want to hang this unit

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.210 
angle we're gonna want to hang this unit
we've<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> unit<00:02:04.410> strut<00:02:04.680> product<00:02:05.040> we're

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
we've got a unit strut product we're

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.070 
we've got a unit strut product we're
gonna<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.700> bolting<00:02:06.120> with<00:02:06.360> cement<00:02:06.630> anchors<00:02:06.930> up

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
gonna be bolting with cement anchors up

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.109 
gonna be bolting with cement anchors up
to<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.530> concrete<00:02:07.920> truss<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.850> we're<00:02:09.000> gonna

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to this concrete truss and we're gonna

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
to this concrete truss and we're gonna
be<00:02:09.330> able<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.630> then<00:02:10.020> mount<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.410> unit<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.980> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
be able to then mount the unit to that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
be able to then mount the unit to that
in<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> struts<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.450> gonna<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.660> burning

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
in the struts that are gonna be burning

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
in the struts that are gonna be burning
a<00:02:13.080> hole<00:02:13.200> through<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.590> wall<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.550> case

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
a hole through the wall in this case

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330 
a hole through the wall in this case
it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.090> block<00:02:15.690> wall<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.260> will<00:02:16.620> pilot<00:02:17.100> drill

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's a block wall I will pilot drill

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
it's a block wall I will pilot drill
some<00:02:17.550> holes<00:02:17.580> first<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:18.959> be

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
some holes first and then we will be

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.620 
some holes first and then we will be
just<00:02:19.860> taking<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> basic<00:02:20.700> hammer<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
just taking a basic hammer to it and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.240 
just taking a basic hammer to it and
just<00:02:21.660> working<00:02:22.320> our<00:02:22.440> way<00:02:22.470> from<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.830> center<00:02:22.980> out

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
just working our way from the center out

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
just working our way from the center out
making<00:02:23.850> sure<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> fits<00:02:24.270> now<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.020> don't<00:02:25.230> want

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
making sure it fits now you don't want

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.350 
making sure it fits now you don't want
ox<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.830> fields<00:02:26.130> building<00:02:26.489> up<00:02:26.580> inside<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
ox just fields building up inside so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.449 
ox just fields building up inside so
this<00:02:27.570> unit<00:02:27.840> has<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> power<00:02:28.410> exhaust<00:02:28.890> function

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
this unit has a power exhaust function

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
this unit has a power exhaust function
that<00:02:29.610> vents<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> harmful<00:02:30.420> gases<00:02:30.810> directly

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that vents the harmful gases directly

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320 
that vents the harmful gases directly
outside<00:02:31.590> we're<00:02:32.459> always<00:02:32.670> gonna<00:02:32.850> try<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> dry

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
outside we're always gonna try to dry

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
outside we're always gonna try to dry
fit<00:02:33.390> everything<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.410> don't<00:02:34.560> dry<00:02:34.800> fit<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
fit everything if you don't dry fit it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.250 
fit everything if you don't dry fit it
and<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.459> start<00:02:35.760> running<00:02:36.300> sealant<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:36.989> stuff

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and you start running sealant on stuff

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.810 
and you start running sealant on stuff
or<00:02:37.410> gluing<00:02:37.620> stuff<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.130> bolting<00:02:38.459> stuff<00:02:38.670> in

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
or gluing stuff or bolting stuff in

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.250 
or gluing stuff or bolting stuff in
doesn't<00:02:39.120> fit<00:02:39.300> makes<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.720> much<00:02:39.870> more<00:02:39.930> work

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
doesn't fit makes it that much more work

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
doesn't fit makes it that much more work
later<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.190> we're<00:02:41.280> gonna<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.640> try<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> make

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
later so we're gonna want to try to make

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.760 
later so we're gonna want to try to make
sure<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.330> fits<00:02:42.570> first<00:02:42.810> once<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.650> our

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
sure all that fits first once we get our

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.110 
sure all that fits first once we get our
venting<00:02:44.070> hole<00:02:44.220> cut<00:02:44.520> through<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.820> make<00:02:44.970> sure

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
venting hole cut through we make sure

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.190 
venting hole cut through we make sure
everything<00:02:45.330> fits<00:02:45.630> we'll<00:02:45.930> go<00:02:46.050> ahead<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
everything fits we'll go ahead and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.780 
everything fits we'll go ahead and
install<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.620> concentric<00:02:47.250> cap<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.670> this

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
install that concentric cap in this

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.610 
install that concentric cap in this
particular<00:02:48.090> unit<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.930> we'll<00:02:49.080> hang<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> unit

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
particular unit then we'll hang the unit

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.140 
particular unit then we'll hang the unit
heater<00:02:49.800> after<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.970> particular

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
case we have a spring clip that actually

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.000 
case we have a spring clip that actually
mounts<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> 3/8<00:02:54.540> inch<00:02:54.570> threaded<00:02:55.080> rod<00:02:55.320> that's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
going to bolt actually to the unit and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.090 
going to bolt actually to the unit and
it<00:02:57.750> pushes<00:02:57.959> up<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.320> said<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> unit<00:02:58.890> strut

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it pushes up and said the unit strut

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.650 
it pushes up and said the unit strut
turns<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.489> quarter<00:02:59.760> turn<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.000> locks<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.540> into

turns a quarter turn and locks it into

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.050 
turns a quarter turn and locks it into
place<00:03:01.040> one<00:03:02.040> thing<00:03:02.190> that's<00:03:02.370> nice<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.880> has<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
place one thing that's nice is it has a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.330 
place one thing that's nice is it has a
fairly<00:03:03.420> low<00:03:03.720> profile<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.769> can<00:03:04.890> hang<00:03:05.070> within

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
fairly low profile so it can hang within

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.370 
fairly low profile so it can hang within
an<00:03:05.459> inch<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> ceiling<00:03:06.360> saves<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> lot

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
an inch of the ceiling saves you a lot

this<00:03:53.370> installation<00:03:53.670> we're<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.240> to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
this installation we're just going to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.700 
this installation we're just going to
use<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> standard<00:03:54.930> thermostat<00:03:55.050> that's<00:03:55.590> going

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
use a standard thermostat that's going

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.660 
use a standard thermostat that's going
to<00:03:55.770> work<00:03:55.830> just<00:03:56.100> fine

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
to work just fine

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.130 
to work just fine
ideally<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.480> want<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.720> keep<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> thermostat

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
ideally we want to keep the thermostat

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.470 
ideally we want to keep the thermostat
out<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> airflow<00:03:59.280> from<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> unit<00:04:00.150> because

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
out of the airflow from the unit because

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.300 
out of the airflow from the unit because
it's<00:04:00.600> going<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> satisfy<00:04:01.050> prematurely<00:04:01.860> which

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
it's going to satisfy prematurely which

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.040 
it's going to satisfy prematurely which
it's<00:04:02.790> still<00:04:02.880> gonna<00:04:03.060> work<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.510> fine<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:04.020> long

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
it's still gonna work this fine as long

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.200 
it's still gonna work this fine as long
as<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.890> homeowner<00:04:05.220> would<00:04:05.430> know<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:06.060> may
