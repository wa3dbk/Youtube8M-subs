00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.530
 I already had two I'm going to present one of my 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.190
 Projects 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.190
 what will it consist 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 I've seen that I already found out 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.910
 in this stone 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.930
 we would have to tie well to put a 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.930
 plastic to protect the treasure 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.789
 we will see the result 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.000
 from here some months 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.880
 this will be project 1 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.880
 February of 9 I think we're 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.070
 after having grabbed it we will do it 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.070
 with a stick 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.220
 on earth 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 airbags 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.360
 so we avoid that the roots rot 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.769
 so it would look determined 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 now you just have to come back with a 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.260
 plastic and so it would stay power 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.260
 34 months 6 months 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.620
 already ready with the plastic the only thing that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.740
 we have to do is have patience 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.890
 this if you have not left any 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.650
 air bubble and can take the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.680
 transplant 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.730
 then start to take strength 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.180
 to grab the stone start the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.180
 intention 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.510
 we will give an irrigation with hormones in root 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.850
 before then 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.640
 will come very well to the tree 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.369
 and already after this in two or 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.610
 three months I will place the second part of 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.320
 this video to see the progress if you have 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.530
 survived the plant or has died 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.299
 if you want to keep watching videos 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.299
 another of my creations 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.349
 this is not common 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 they are bonsai texts within others 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.709
 pots with rocks 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 little mermaid elephants I can fill everything 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.989
 of water 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.989
 to a very rare thing 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.020
 within the most showy that would be a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.020
 tree on a stone 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.700
 - I do not know what the translation would be like 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.620
 bonsai pot would be something about that is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 something on stone I do not know what it would be called 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 well this is all we see in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.250
 next if you want to keep watching videos 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.190
 subscribe 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.190
 and give me a like they are then flat
