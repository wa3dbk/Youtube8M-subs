hello<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.890> video<00:00:02.220> will<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.550> on<00:00:02.580> finding<00:00:03.449> the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hello this video will be on finding the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.059 
hello this video will be on finding the
North<00:00:03.750> Star<00:00:04.140> I've<00:00:04.589> been<00:00:04.830> getting<00:00:05.040> that

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
North Star I've been getting that

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.059 
North Star I've been getting that
question<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> lot<00:00:05.670> lately<00:00:06.089> so<00:00:07.020> what<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:07.950> want

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
question a lot lately so what you want

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.310 
question a lot lately so what you want
to<00:00:08.130> do<00:00:08.220> first<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.639> find<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.000> Big<00:00:09.150> Dipper<00:00:09.330> it's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
to do first is find the Big Dipper it's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.100 
to do first is find the Big Dipper it's
over<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.070> see<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.280> handle<00:00:11.759> right<00:00:11.910> there

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
over here you see the handle right there

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
over here you see the handle right there
so<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.170> want<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> find<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> two<00:00:14.040> stars<00:00:14.460> that

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so you want to find the two stars that

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.570 
so you want to find the two stars that
are<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> opposite<00:00:16.289> side<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> Big

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
are on the opposite side of the Big

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.420 
are on the opposite side of the Big
Dipper<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> handle<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.770> farthest<00:00:20.220> from

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
Dipper from the handle the farthest from

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.750 
Dipper from the handle the farthest from
the<00:00:20.520> handle<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.660> these<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the handle so it's these two here so you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.550 
the handle so it's these two here so you
want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> take<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.539> star<00:00:25.170> that's<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
want to take the star that's at the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
want to take the star that's at the
bottom<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> bowl<00:00:26.250> line<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
bottom of the bowl line it up with the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
bottom of the bowl line it up with the
star<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> top<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> bowl<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> then

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
star at the top of the bowl and then

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.209 
star at the top of the bowl and then
just<00:00:30.240> draw<00:00:30.660> an<00:00:30.779> imaginary<00:00:30.900> line<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.800> continue

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
just draw an imaginary line and continue

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
just draw an imaginary line and continue
that<00:00:32.399> line<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.910> till<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> find<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> next

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that line out till you find the next

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
that line out till you find the next
bright<00:00:34.680> star<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> North

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
bright star and there it is the North

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
bright star and there it is the North
Star<00:00:37.079> Polaris<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.809> Polaris<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Star Polaris so Polaris then is the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.549 
Star Polaris so Polaris then is the
brightest<00:00:42.090> star<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.079> Little<00:00:43.410> Dipper<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
brightest star in the Little Dipper and

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.660 
brightest star in the Little Dipper and
the<00:00:46.559> rest<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> stars<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.399> Little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the rest of the stars in the Little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
the rest of the stars in the Little
Dipper<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.690> hard<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.170> players

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Dipper are pretty hard to see players

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090 
Dipper are pretty hard to see players
itself<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.149> bright<00:00:51.329> star<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
itself is not a very bright star it's a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
itself is not a very bright star it's a
magnitude<00:00:53.690> 2.0<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.610> brightest<00:00:57.300> star<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
magnitude 2.0 the brightest star is the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.660 
magnitude 2.0 the brightest star is the
lower<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> number<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> brighter<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lower the number the brighter it is so a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.750 
lower the number the brighter it is so a
1.0<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.230> much<00:01:01.440> brighter<00:01:01.680> than<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> 2.0

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
1.0 would be much brighter than a 2.0

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.440 
1.0 would be much brighter than a 2.0
and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.690> stars<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.180> Little

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and then the other stars in the Little

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.070 
and then the other stars in the Little
Dipper<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> 4.3<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:09.020> kind<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Dipper that one is 4.3 that's kind of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.149 
Dipper that one is 4.3 that's kind of
hard<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.860> one's<00:01:11.100> 4.2<00:01:12.799> 4.3<00:01:16.159> 5.0

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
hard to see this one's 4.2 4.3 5.0

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.480 
hard to see this one's 4.2 4.3 5.0
that's<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:17.729> harder<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:19.520> 2.0<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:22.490> five

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that's even harder to see 2.0 and five

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's even harder to see 2.0 and five
point<00:01:24.060> oh<00:01:24.270> three<00:01:25.340> point<00:01:26.340> oh<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.850> North

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
point oh three point oh so the North

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
point oh three point oh so the North
Star<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> brightest<00:01:30.960> star<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> Little

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
Star is the brightest star the Little

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
Star is the brightest star the Little
Dipper<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> hard<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
Dipper so it would be kind of hard to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.380 
Dipper so it would be kind of hard to
find<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.750> Little<00:01:34.049> Dipper<00:01:35.210> unless<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
find the Little Dipper unless you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
find the Little Dipper unless you
already<00:01:36.540> knew<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> North<00:01:37.259> Star<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.710> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
already knew where the North Star was so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.560 
already knew where the North Star was so
the<00:01:38.159> star<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> Big<00:01:38.909> Dipper<00:01:39.090> much

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the star is in the Big Dipper much

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:53.680 
the star is in the Big Dipper much
brighter<00:01:40.820> 2.0<00:01:43.310> 2.3<00:01:45.649> 2.4<00:01:48.619> 3.3<00:01:51.229> 1.8

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
brighter 2.0 2.3 2.4 3.3 1.8

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.090 
brighter 2.0 2.3 2.4 3.3 1.8
1.9<00:01:55.690> 2.2<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.930> all<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.140> those<00:01:57.350> stars<00:01:57.710> are<00:01:57.920> just

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
1.9 2.2 so all of those stars are just

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.940 
1.9 2.2 so all of those stars are just
about<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.400> same<00:01:58.670> brightness<00:01:59.000> as<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:00.740> North

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
about the same brightness as the North

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.710 
about the same brightness as the North
Star<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:01.610> much<00:02:01.790> brighter<00:02:02.120> than<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.450> other

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
Star but much brighter than the other

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.140 
Star but much brighter than the other
stars<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.530> Little<00:02:03.860> Dipper<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:07.550> once<00:02:08.030> you

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
stars in the Little Dipper so once you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.960 
stars in the Little Dipper so once you
draw<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.360> imaginary<00:02:08.900> line<00:02:09.850> should<00:02:10.850> look

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
draw that imaginary line should look

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.930 
draw that imaginary line should look
with<00:02:11.120> something<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.800> there's<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
with something like this so there's the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.720 
with something like this so there's the
handle<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> Big<00:02:14.600> Dipper<00:02:15.340> here's<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> bowl

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
handle of the Big Dipper here's the bowl

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.030 
handle of the Big Dipper here's the bowl
the<00:02:17.120> two<00:02:17.300> stars<00:02:17.630> at<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.960> end<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> bowl

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the two stars at the end of the bowl

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.730 
the two stars at the end of the bowl
away<00:02:19.280> from<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> handle<00:02:20.210> draw<00:02:21.020> your<00:02:21.050> imaginary

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
away from the handle draw your imaginary

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.850 
away from the handle draw your imaginary
line<00:02:22.010> continue<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.880> down<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.630> there's<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
line continue it down and there's the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160 
line continue it down and there's the
North<00:02:25.040> Star<00:02:25.280> which<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:26.390> tells<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.840> your

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
North Star which then tells you your

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.150 
North Star which then tells you your
latitude<00:02:27.710> here's<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.700> horizon<00:02:29.360> down<00:02:29.540> here

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
latitude here's the horizon down here

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.720 
latitude here's the horizon down here
and<00:02:32.020> from<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.170> horizon<00:02:33.710> up<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> North

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and from the horizon up to the North

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.710 
and from the horizon up to the North
Star<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.280> view<00:02:37.910> from<00:02:38.270> st.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
Star this is from the view from st.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.460 
Star this is from the view from st.
Louis<00:02:39.110> Missouri<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.060> 38<00:02:41.930> degrees

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
Louis Missouri and so this is 38 degrees

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.310 
Louis Missouri and so this is 38 degrees
forty-five<00:02:43.160> minutes<00:02:43.790> above<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.570> horizon<00:02:44.690> and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
forty-five minutes above the horizon and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.390 
forty-five minutes above the horizon and
thus<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.160> latitude<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.030> st.<00:02:47.720> Louis<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.350> were<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
thus the latitude of st. Louis I were to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.490 
thus the latitude of st. Louis I were to
do<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.580> for<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:51.050> me<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.680> Hawaii<00:02:53.140> we're<00:02:54.140> at

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
do it for for me here in Hawaii we're at

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:03.310 
do it for for me here in Hawaii we're at
not<00:02:55.430> time<00:02:58.720> location<00:02:59.720> location<00:03:02.320> Honolulu

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
not time location location Honolulu

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.580 
not time location location Honolulu
Hawaii

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.070 

you<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:13.370> see<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.910> North<00:03:14.239> Star<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.510> much

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
you can see here the North Star is much

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.100 
you can see here the North Star is much
lower<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> horizon<00:03:17.739> only<00:03:18.849> 21<00:03:19.849> degrees<00:03:20.110> 32

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
lower to the horizon only 21 degrees 32

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.860 
lower to the horizon only 21 degrees 32
minutes<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.640> our<00:03:22.940> latitude<00:03:23.300> here<00:03:23.720> in

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
minutes and so our latitude here in

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
minutes and so our latitude here in
Hawaii<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.470> 21<00:03:25.160> degrees<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.170> North<00:03:27.620> Star

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
Hawaii is 21 degrees so the North Star

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.369 
Hawaii is 21 degrees so the North Star
is<00:03:27.920> pretty<00:03:28.610> low<00:03:28.879> actually<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.840> view<00:03:30.080> from

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
is pretty low actually the view from

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.820 
is pretty low actually the view from
from<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.549> Waikiki<00:03:32.060> Honolulu<00:03:32.900> area<00:03:33.260> puts<00:03:33.709> it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
from the Waikiki Honolulu area puts it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.369 
from the Waikiki Honolulu area puts it
just<00:03:34.099> barely<00:03:34.430> above<00:03:34.819> mountains<00:03:35.390> which<00:03:36.200> is

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
just barely above mountains which is

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.800 
just barely above mountains which is
then<00:03:36.620> usually<00:03:37.190> shrouded<00:03:37.849> in<00:03:37.970> clouds<00:03:38.150> and

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
then usually shrouded in clouds and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.860 
then usually shrouded in clouds and
being<00:03:39.799> that<00:03:40.010> low<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.370> horizon<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.720> not<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
being that low to the horizon it's not a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.479 
being that low to the horizon it's not a
very<00:03:42.049> bright<00:03:42.349> star<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.160> kind<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.430> hard

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
very bright star so it's kind of hard

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.370 
very bright star so it's kind of hard
for<00:03:43.819> us<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:43.940> see<00:03:44.269> here<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.930> then<00:03:45.829> as<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:48.110> stars

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
for us to see here and then as the stars

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140 
for us to see here and then as the stars
go<00:03:48.739> around<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.970> Big<00:03:50.120> Dipper

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
go around you can see the Big Dipper

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.850 
go around you can see the Big Dipper
going<00:03:50.989> over<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.500> North<00:03:51.680> Star<00:03:51.829> there<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.860> the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
going over the North Star there and the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.369 
going over the North Star there and the
Big<00:03:55.040> Dipper<00:03:55.220> will<00:03:55.519> actually<00:03:56.060> dip<00:03:56.510> below<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
Big Dipper will actually dip below the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.470 
Big Dipper will actually dip below the
horizon<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:58.280> here's<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.700> horizon<00:03:59.299> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
horizon so here's the horizon and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.809 
horizon so here's the horizon and
there's<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.829> Big<00:04:00.980> Dipper<00:04:01.010> go<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.519> blow<00:04:01.670> the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
there's the Big Dipper go and blow the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.940 
there's the Big Dipper go and blow the
horizon<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.420> mountains<00:04:02.959> are<00:04:03.110> about<00:04:03.379> here

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
horizon and the mountains are about here

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.229 
horizon and the mountains are about here
so<00:04:04.329> there<00:04:05.329> are<00:04:05.540> times<00:04:05.959> when<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:07.579> cannot<00:04:07.940> use

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
so there are times when you cannot use

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.900 
so there are times when you cannot use
the<00:04:08.510> Big<00:04:08.660> Dipper<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:10.010> find<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.610> North<00:04:10.790> Star

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
the Big Dipper to find the North Star

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.780 
the Big Dipper to find the North Star
and<00:04:11.360> so<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> do<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.440> use<00:04:12.790> Cassiopeia

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
and so what I do is I use Cassiopeia

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.009 
and so what I do is I use Cassiopeia
over<00:04:14.629> here<00:04:14.870> looks<00:04:15.290> like<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.500> w<00:04:15.890> or<00:04:16.160> an<00:04:16.400> M<00:04:17.019> usually

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
over here looks like a w or an M usually

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.740 
over here looks like a w or an M usually
a<00:04:18.049> w<00:04:18.470> but<00:04:19.250> anyway<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.489> use<00:04:19.850> these<00:04:20.090> stars<00:04:20.359> here

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
a w but anyway I use these stars here

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.490 
a w but anyway I use these stars here
and<00:04:20.959> then<00:04:21.139> they<00:04:21.470> don't<00:04:21.650> really<00:04:21.859> point<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and then they don't really point to the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.250 
and then they don't really point to the
north<00:04:24.710> star<00:04:24.979> but<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.550> take<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:26.260> the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
north star but if you take the the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.350 
north star but if you take the the
middle<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:27.979> w<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.729> way<00:04:28.849> that<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.150> points

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
middle of the w the way that it points

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.000 
middle of the w the way that it points
it<00:04:29.690> points<00:04:30.110> kind<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.620> general<00:04:31.340> area<00:04:33.010> not

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
it points kind of in general area not

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.469 
it points kind of in general area not
really<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.520> kind<00:04:34.700> of<00:04:34.729> goes<00:04:34.880> this<00:04:35.090> way<00:04:35.270> but<00:04:35.450> I

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
really it kind of goes this way but I

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.719 
really it kind of goes this way but I
know<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:36.080> if<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.289> find<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.099> I<00:04:37.190> move<00:04:37.430> kind

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
know that if I find that and I move kind

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.790 
know that if I find that and I move kind
of<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:38.060> way<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.570> find<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.900> brightest<00:04:39.620> star

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
of this way and find the brightest star

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.310 
of this way and find the brightest star
in<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.070> area<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.630> Polaris<00:04:42.289> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
in that area there it is Polaris the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.909 
in that area there it is Polaris the
North<00:04:42.500> Star<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:45.050> will<00:04:45.260> stay<00:04:45.410> stationary

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
North Star so it will stay stationary

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.940 
North Star so it will stay stationary
pretty<00:04:46.669> much<00:04:46.910> as<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.960> other<00:04:48.080> stars<00:04:48.380> go<00:04:48.620> around

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
pretty much as the other stars go around

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.409 
pretty much as the other stars go around
there<00:04:49.190> goes<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.490> Big<00:04:49.610> Dipper<00:04:49.760> over<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.210> top

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
there goes the Big Dipper over the top

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.620 
there goes the Big Dipper over the top
here<00:04:51.139> comes<00:04:51.349> Cassiopeia<00:04:52.039> over<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.490> top<00:04:52.669> so

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
here comes Cassiopeia over the top so

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.820 
here comes Cassiopeia over the top so
you<00:04:53.660> can<00:04:53.810> see<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.110> makes<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.470> good<00:04:54.620> reference

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
you can see that makes a good reference

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.969 
you can see that makes a good reference
point<00:04:55.099> for<00:04:55.400> finding<00:04:56.090> North<00:04:56.810> all<00:04:57.530> of<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.830> other

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
point for finding North all of the other

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.710 
point for finding North all of the other
bright<00:04:58.580> stars<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.300> know<00:04:59.389> a<00:04:59.419> lot<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.630> people

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
bright stars you know a lot of people

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.390 
bright stars you know a lot of people
think<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.320> North<00:05:00.830> Star<00:05:01.099> is<00:05:01.130> the

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
think that the North Star is the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.350 
think that the North Star is the
brightest<00:05:01.729> star<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.090> sky<00:05:03.250> actually<00:05:04.360> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
brightest star in the sky actually the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.170 
brightest star in the sky actually the
brightest<00:05:05.990> stars<00:05:06.229> in<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.500> sky<00:05:06.740> rise<00:05:07.370> in<00:05:07.849> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
brightest stars in the sky rise in the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.450 
brightest stars in the sky rise in the
east<00:05:08.740> go<00:05:09.740> across<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.280> southern<00:05:10.490> sky<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:12.460> set

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
east go across the southern sky and set

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.680 
east go across the southern sky and set
in<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.669> West<00:05:14.349> so<00:05:15.349> if<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.919> were<00:05:16.099> to<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:17.570> be

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
in the West so if you were to to be

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.330 
in the West so if you were to to be
following<00:05:18.200> any<00:05:18.320> one<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.620> those<00:05:18.800> stars

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.550 

you<00:05:21.460> would<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:22.360> going<00:05:22.540> every<00:05:22.960> direction<00:05:23.080> but

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
you would be going every direction but

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.890 
you would be going every direction but
north<00:05:23.949> and<00:05:24.280> actually<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.210> going<00:05:25.419> in<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.630> circle

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
north and actually to going in a circle

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.990 
north and actually to going in a circle
as<00:05:26.199> it<00:05:26.350> rises<00:05:26.710> in<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.040> east<00:05:27.220> goes<00:05:27.610> across<00:05:27.790> the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
as it rises in the east goes across the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.760 
as it rises in the east goes across the
South<00:05:28.240> sets<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.780> West<00:05:29.020> comes<00:05:29.380> back<00:05:29.530> up

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
South sets of the West comes back up

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.070 
South sets of the West comes back up
again<00:05:30.040> and<00:05:30.250> east<00:05:30.520> yet<00:05:30.790> so<00:05:31.750> you<00:05:31.840> wouldn't<00:05:32.050> be

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
again and east yet so you wouldn't be

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.010 
again and east yet so you wouldn't be
getting<00:05:32.229> very<00:05:32.590> far<00:05:32.860> yeah<00:05:33.250> there<00:05:33.550> are<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:34.210> lot<00:05:34.990> of

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
getting very far yeah there are a lot of

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.570 
getting very far yeah there are a lot of
stars<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.440> are<00:05:35.590> much<00:05:35.830> brighter<00:05:36.070> than<00:05:36.340> North

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
stars that are much brighter than North

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.960 
stars that are much brighter than North
Star<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:36.940> North<00:05:37.150> Star<00:05:37.389> is<00:05:37.419> actually<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:39.070> 48th

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
Star the North Star is actually the 48th

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.140 
Star the North Star is actually the 48th
brightest<00:05:40.900> star<00:05:41.229> not<00:05:42.070> counting<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.729> five

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
brightest star not counting the five

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.560 
brightest star not counting the five
visible<00:05:43.660> planets<00:05:44.050> which<00:05:44.260> can<00:05:44.949> actually<00:05:45.340> get

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
visible planets which can actually get

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.590 
visible planets which can actually get
even<00:05:46.570> brighter<00:05:46.900> than<00:05:47.290> the<00:05:47.350> brightest<00:05:47.800> stars

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
even brighter than the brightest stars

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.560 
even brighter than the brightest stars
so<00:05:49.600> you've<00:05:49.810> got<00:05:50.160> 47<00:05:51.160> other<00:05:51.340> stars<00:05:51.729> plus<00:05:52.240> five

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
so you've got 47 other stars plus five

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.469 
so you've got 47 other stars plus five
planets<00:05:53.340> so<00:05:54.340> there's<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.580> lot<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:54.760> things<00:05:55.240> in

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
planets so there's a lot of things in

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.940 
planets so there's a lot of things in
the<00:05:55.570> sky<00:05:55.690> that<00:05:55.810> are<00:05:56.110> much<00:05:56.290> brighter<00:05:56.590> than<00:05:56.889> the

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
the sky that are much brighter than the

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.969 
the sky that are much brighter than the
North<00:05:57.190> Star<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:57.850> that's<00:05:58.780> that's<00:05:59.169> one<00:05:59.590> myth

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
North Star so that's that's one myth

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.830 
North Star so that's that's one myth
that<00:06:00.220> I<00:06:00.280> wish<00:06:00.550> would<00:06:00.729> go<00:06:00.910> away<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.479> North<00:06:01.660> Star

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
that I wish would go away the North Star

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.070 
that I wish would go away the North Star
is<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.919> brightest<00:06:03.280> star<00:06:03.460> in<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.790> sky<00:06:04.419> by

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
is not the brightest star in the sky by

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.000 
is not the brightest star in the sky by
far<00:06:06.000> 47<00:06:07.000> other<00:06:07.150> stars<00:06:07.479> and<00:06:07.750> five<00:06:07.900> planets<00:06:08.410> that

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
far 47 other stars and five planets that

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.129 
far 47 other stars and five planets that
are<00:06:09.070> even<00:06:09.280> brighter<00:06:09.669> than<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:09.970> North<00:06:10.240> Star<00:06:10.540> so

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
are even brighter than the North Star so

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.610 
are even brighter than the North Star so
there<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.410> go<00:06:11.440> how<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.740> find<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.070> North<00:06:12.250> Star

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
there you go how to find the North Star

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.100 
there you go how to find the North Star
very<00:06:14.620> important
