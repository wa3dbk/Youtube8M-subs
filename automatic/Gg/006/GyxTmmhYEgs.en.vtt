00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.480
 Hello guys, that's it 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.810
 finally the long-awaited game we all 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.450
 waited as it is called of course hail 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.940
 hall the five but unfortunately she is not 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.970
 everyone started and unfortunately 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.800
 too but I attribute the way out of this problem 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.130
 and it is extremely simple 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:46.430
 we need to go to my documents 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.800
 and in the folder rockstar games select here in 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.380
 gta 5 folder 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.810
 there is a game settings file settings and 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.320
 less xml extension will need it 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.110
 remove delete it 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:05.210
 then we go to the setup section 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:09.229
 switchable graphics and here we find 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.770
 our gta 5 game needs to be assigned to this 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.030
 file performance is low 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.030
 choose power saving mode 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.369
 apply parameters 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:27.670
 now we can run our game 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:30.800
 go back and run gta5 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.979
 After waiting a little, we see this 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.830
 message unrecoverable error not 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.649
 scared don't worry come back 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.100
 in md catalyst control center and choose 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.729
 there is already high performance at 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.649
 change the parameters 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.479
 in principle, this window can be closed 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.270
 video adapter settings 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.289
 Now click on the ok button and we 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.590
 the game starts hurray we have started 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.289
 playing on a discrete video card yes friends 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.720
 many laptop users are experiencing 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.270
 Now such a problem that this game 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.280
 just refuses to run on 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.930
 discrete graphics card whether this 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.959
 invidia video card 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.709
 or md as in my case for example i 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.110
 experienced experienced the same problem 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.090
 launching it means I the game does not start 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.349
 I think what I switch to n 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.349
 hectare mode 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.460
 Lord, as it is called 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.640
 power saving mode please forgive 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.680
 Here and the game I run but of course 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.080
 built-in graphics cards from intel they 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.420
 much weaker and you are so simple 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 you will not be able to play terrible brakes 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 This is the way to start the game. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.360
 on external on a discrete graphics card and in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.910
 As a result, you will get a stable 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.520
 fps by the way it should be noted that the game 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.500
 very well optimized goes on 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.230
 frankly weak computers for example 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.080
 on my laptop which is probably already 34 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.220
 years probably how much his wife is playing 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.710
 in principle, does not slow down and so here it is 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.300
 we booted yes unfortunately if we 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.220
 delete the settings file 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.540
 the game will start here like this 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.670
 with minimal settings for this us 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.800
 we need to return the settings we can 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 go to the graphics section and get out 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.110
 his permission I have it is to have 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.850
 you will certainly be higher 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.370
 okay and so you can turn 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.290
 smoothing my video card it allows 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.040
 apply changes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.830
 Well, let 's do it here 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.850
 look at all about rovnenko 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.790
 smoothly 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.860
 and beautiful and nothing buggy and 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.660
 does not slow down because now the game 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.600
 uses 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.540
 discrete graphics card just like that 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.230
 is it treated while on the internet of another 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.070
 options for running this game on laptops 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.800
 I unfortunately did not find it 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.300
 minus minus this way if we are now 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.970
 go back to the settings and want to change 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.550
 resolution of textures for example setting 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.040
 high resolution textures or 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.650
 improved shaders game us this to 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.100
 Sorry to do not allow because 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.620
 she will ask us to restart herself 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.040
 we will need to restart the game and 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.400
 if we restart the game we already have it 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.890
 but on a discrete video card will not start 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.229
 yes that's such a trouble to follow 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.980
 since you game started you need 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.410
 do this manipulation 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.940
 delete settings file first 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.840
 poor performance and after 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.840
 removal high
