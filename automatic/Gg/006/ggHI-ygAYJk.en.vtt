do<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.920> little<00:03:30.220> more<00:03:30.459> down<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:30.760> underneath<00:03:31.389> if

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
do a little more down here underneath if

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.229 
do a little more down here underneath if
you<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.290> then<00:03:32.549> she<00:03:33.549> does<00:03:33.579> have<00:03:33.970> some

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
you want and then she does have some

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.270 
you want and then she does have some
shadow<00:03:34.540> contouring<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.500> above<00:03:35.889> just<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
shadow contouring up above just the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.949 
shadow contouring up above just the
lower<00:03:36.519> lid<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.209> we're<00:03:37.329> just<00:03:37.359> going<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.690> start

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
lower lid so we're just going to start

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.509 
lower lid so we're just going to start
from<00:03:38.139> where<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.470> shadow<00:03:38.709> stops<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.370> just

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
from where that shadow stops and just

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.910 
from where that shadow stops and just
kind<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.819> just<00:03:40.480> fuzz<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.079> upwards<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.680> little

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
kind of just fuzz it upwards a little

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680 
kind of just fuzz it upwards a little
bit<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.549> an<00:03:42.639> extra<00:03:43.030> step<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.510> don't

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
bit and this is an extra step you don't

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.780 
bit and this is an extra step you don't
have<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.109> do<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.709> want<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.340> super

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
have to do this if you want to be super

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.879 
have to do this if you want to be super
fast<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:47.019> way<00:03:47.139> you<00:03:47.200> could<00:03:47.410> do<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:47.650> makeup

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
fast that way you could do this makeup

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.129 
fast that way you could do this makeup
and<00:03:48.250> kind<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.549> be<00:03:48.670> done<00:03:49.359> with<00:03:49.540> your<00:03:49.690> makeup<00:03:49.870> in

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
and kind of be done with your makeup in

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.879 
and kind of be done with your makeup in
just<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.470> matter<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.769> minutes<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:53.680> you're<00:03:53.859> a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
just a matter of minutes and if you're a

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.500 
just a matter of minutes and if you're a
younger<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.670> don't<00:03:54.970> need<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.269> do<00:03:55.389> your

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
younger you don't need to do your

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.870 
younger you don't need to do your
eyebrows<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.530> know<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.920> might<00:03:57.069> make<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.730> look

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
eyebrows you know it might make you look

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520 
eyebrows you know it might make you look
a<00:03:58.030> little<00:03:58.150> older<00:03:58.359> than<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.810> want<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.079> look<00:03:59.230> so

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
a little older than you want to look so

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.129 
a little older than you want to look so
um<00:03:59.829> if<00:04:00.579> you're<00:04:01.090> older<00:04:01.450> go<00:04:01.599> ahead<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.930> do<00:04:02.019> them

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
um if you're older go ahead and do them

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.660 
um if you're older go ahead and do them
I<00:04:02.230> just<00:04:02.470> already<00:04:02.799> did<00:04:03.099> them<00:04:03.250> with<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> light

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
I just already did them with a light

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.390 
I just already did them with a light
brown<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:05.200> they<00:04:05.349> couldn't<00:04:05.709> be<00:04:05.889> out<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.250> way

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
brown so they couldn't be out of the way

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.190 
brown so they couldn't be out of the way
so<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.700> just<00:04:06.910> smudge<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.420> all<00:04:07.540> over<00:04:07.930> and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so you just smudge that all over and

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.020 
so you just smudge that all over and
then<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.190> feel<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.639> did<00:04:09.670> any

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
then if you feel like you did any

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.849 
then if you feel like you did any
blending<00:04:10.359> mistakes<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.959> take<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.349> pink<00:04:11.680> or

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
blending mistakes just take that pink or

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.250 
blending mistakes just take that pink or
that<00:04:11.980> peachy<00:04:12.340> color<00:04:12.599> get<00:04:13.599> on<00:04:13.720> your<00:04:13.810> brush<00:04:14.019> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
that peachy color get on your brush and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.860 
that peachy color get on your brush and
just<00:04:14.650> hit<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> front<00:04:15.669> area<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.479> it'll<00:04:16.810> just

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
just hit the front area and it'll just

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.319 
just hit the front area and it'll just
kind<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.289> erase<00:04:17.650> all<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.700> mistakes<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.150> you

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
kind of erase all the mistakes that you

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.779 
kind of erase all the mistakes that you
made<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.720> then<00:04:20.709> another<00:04:20.979> trick<00:04:21.340> I'll<00:04:21.549> show

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
made and then another trick I'll show

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.279 
made and then another trick I'll show
you<00:04:21.849> is<00:04:22.120> with<00:04:22.390> your<00:04:22.599> mascara<00:04:23.140> because

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
you is with your mascara because

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.930 
you is with your mascara because
sometimes<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.979> don't<00:04:24.159> show<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.400> guys<00:04:24.580> how<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.789> do

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
sometimes I don't show you guys how I do

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.640 
sometimes I don't show you guys how I do
that<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.419> use<00:04:26.020> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
that I use the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.070 
that I use the
double<00:04:27.190> extend<00:04:27.580> tubes<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.449> you<00:04:28.720> want<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.960> get

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
double extend tubes and you want to get

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.070 
double extend tubes and you want to get
the<00:04:29.199> white<00:04:29.410> layer<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:31.240> before<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:31.630> dry

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
the white layer on and before it's dry

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.120 
the white layer on and before it's dry
you<00:04:32.410> want<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.830> put<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.130> black<00:04:33.430> layer<00:04:33.699> on<00:04:35.130> but

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
you want to put the black layer on but

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.279 
you want to put the black layer on but
we'll<00:04:36.370> let<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.910> dry<00:04:37.449> for<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.720> second<00:04:38.110> but

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
we'll let that dry for a second but

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.499 
we'll let that dry for a second but
another<00:04:38.560> trick<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.669> tubes<00:04:39.940> always<00:04:40.300> come

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
another trick is the tubes always come

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.450 
another trick is the tubes always come
out<00:04:40.660> straight<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.289> what<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.500> do<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.130> stick

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
out straight so what I do is you stick

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.219 
out straight so what I do is you stick
it<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.759> tube<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:43.750> about<00:04:43.900> halfway

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
it in the tube and then about halfway

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.110 
it in the tube and then about halfway
when<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.100> half<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.520> bristles<00:04:45.910> are<00:04:46.000> in

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
when the half of the bristles are in

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.050 
when the half of the bristles are in
just<00:04:46.720> pull<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.199> down<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.770> then<00:04:48.250> bend<00:04:48.669> your

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
just pull it down and then bend your

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.930 
just pull it down and then bend your
brush<00:04:49.810> now<00:04:50.259> you<00:04:50.320> have<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.590> custom<00:04:51.100> rise<00:04:51.460> brush

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
brush now you have a custom rise brush

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.120 
brush now you have a custom rise brush
and<00:04:52.389> then<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.470> just<00:04:53.560> leave<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:53.949> and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
and then you just leave it like that and

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.350 
and then you just leave it like that and
keep<00:04:54.310> putting<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.669> back<00:04:54.759> in<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> tube<00:04:55.180> that

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
keep putting it back in the tube that

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.939 
keep putting it back in the tube that
way<00:04:55.509> you<00:04:55.720> won't<00:04:55.870> hurt<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.229> or<00:04:56.320> anything<00:04:56.530> and

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
way you won't hurt it or anything and

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.090 
way you won't hurt it or anything and
then<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.699> like<00:04:57.759> all<00:04:58.000> those<00:04:58.150> fancy<00:04:59.100> mascaras

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
then it's like all those fancy mascaras

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.040 
then it's like all those fancy mascaras
that<00:05:00.370> come<00:05:00.580> with<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.910> fancy<00:05:01.150> curved<00:05:01.660> brush

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
that come with the fancy curved brush

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.620 
that come with the fancy curved brush
when<00:05:02.410> they're<00:05:03.250> all<00:05:03.370> made<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> wire<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.389> can

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
when they're all made a wire so you can
