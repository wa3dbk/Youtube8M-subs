00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
your turntable and my turntables are set

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570 
your turntable and my turntables are set
to<00:02:09.539> play<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.929> 33.3<00:02:10.860> rpm

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to play at 33.3 rpm

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.990 
to play at 33.3 rpm
that's<00:02:11.790> correct<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.130> down<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.850> is

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that's correct and down here this is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.260 
that's correct and down here this is
important<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.170> shows<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.430> signal<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
important it shows that the signal the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.620 
important it shows that the signal the
control<00:02:18.630> signal<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.530> being<00:02:19.830> received<00:02:20.220> 100%<00:02:21.060> so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
control signal is being received 100% so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.230 
control signal is being received 100% so
if<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.470> put<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> needles<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.460> record<00:02:23.790> hit

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
if you put the needles on the record hit

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.150 
if you put the needles on the record hit
play<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> you're<00:02:25.230> not<00:02:25.410> getting<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.740> circular

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
play and you're not getting the circular

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.920 
play and you're not getting the circular
patterns<00:02:26.610> there's<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.300> couple<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.600> things<00:02:27.750> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
patterns there's a couple of things you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.800 
patterns there's a couple of things you
can<00:02:27.960> do<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.500> adjust<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.490> signal<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.780> have

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
can do to adjust the signal you have

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
can do to adjust the signal you have
your<00:02:31.320> left-right<00:02:32.010> balance<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.910> have

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
your left-right balance and you have

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
your left-right balance and you have
your<00:02:33.210> phase<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> anti<00:02:33.930> phase<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.500> both<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
your phase and anti phase and both of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.160 
your phase and anti phase and both of
these<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:36.240> change<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.170> shape<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.810> make<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
these can change the shape to make it a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.520 
these can change the shape to make it a
more<00:02:40.380> round<00:02:40.680> circle<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.570> necessary<00:02:42.570> if<00:02:43.230> by<00:02:43.410> any

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
more round circle if necessary if by any

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
more round circle if necessary if by any
chance<00:02:43.650> your<00:02:45.470> circle<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.680> smaller<00:02:47.210> like<00:02:48.210> this

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
chance your circle is smaller like this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.510 
chance your circle is smaller like this
this<00:02:49.380> allows<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.840> change<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.290> size<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
this allows you to change the size and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.290 
this allows you to change the size and
increase<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.750> input<00:02:55.110> signal<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.910> perfect

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
increase the input signal it's perfect

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.930 
increase the input signal it's perfect
like<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.840> you're<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.680> getting<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.280> circle

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
like this if you're not getting a circle

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.010 
like this if you're not getting a circle
at<00:03:00.090> all<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:00.600> you're<00:03:00.690> getting<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.230> line<00:03:01.770> like

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
at all but you're getting a line like

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.330 
at all but you're getting a line like
this<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:06.360> means<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.709> not<00:03:08.040> getting

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
this this means that it's not getting

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.699 
this this means that it's not getting
the<00:03:08.580> signal<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.120> stereo<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:10.020> took<00:03:10.140> out<00:03:10.350> one

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
the signal in stereo I just took out one

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.030 
the signal in stereo I just took out one
part<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.630> stereo<00:03:12.630> RCA<00:03:12.900> plugs<00:03:13.500> from<00:03:13.860> my

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
part of the stereo RCA plugs from my

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.740 
part of the stereo RCA plugs from my
turntable<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> cerrado<00:03:15.090> box<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:17.660> let<00:03:18.660> me

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
turntable to the cerrado box and let me

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.390 
turntable to the cerrado box and let me
plug<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.050> back<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.800> go<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.220> if

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
plug it back in there you go so if

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.040 
plug it back in there you go so if
you're<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.640> getting<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.970> circle<00:03:21.510> then

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
you're not getting the circle then

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.330 
you're not getting the circle then
there's<00:03:22.320> something<00:03:22.769> wrong<00:03:22.950> with<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
there's something wrong with the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.240 
there's something wrong with the
connection<00:03:23.670> from<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> turntable<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.530> your

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
connection from the turntable to your

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.600 
connection from the turntable to your
survival<00:03:27.030> audio<00:03:27.600> interface<00:03:28.400> okay<00:03:29.400> there's

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
survival audio interface okay there's

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.979 
survival audio interface okay there's
one<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.910> thing<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.269> need<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.630> right<00:03:30.750> now

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
one more thing we need to do right now

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.440 
one more thing we need to do right now
and<00:03:31.290> that's<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> sensitivity<00:03:32.670> level

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and that's set the sensitivity level

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.430 
and that's set the sensitivity level
Serratos<00:03:34.350> sensitivity<00:03:35.160> level<00:03:35.519> for

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
Serratos sensitivity level for

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.640 
Serratos sensitivity level for
background<00:03:37.440> audio<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.930> needles<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.230> your

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
background audio so the needles on your

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.020 
background audio so the needles on your
vinyl<00:03:40.920> are<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.550> sending<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
vinyl are going to be sending the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.170 
vinyl are going to be sending the
control<00:03:42.540> signal<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.650> needles<00:03:44.459> also<00:03:44.910> pick

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
control signal but the needles also pick

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.930 
control signal but the needles also pick
up<00:03:45.209> background<00:03:45.660> noise<00:03:46.100> including<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.670> music

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
up background noise including the music

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.480 
were to play in a club with your
sensitivity<00:04:23.449> level<00:04:24.050> set<00:04:24.349> like<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:27.310> as<00:04:28.310> you

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
sensitivity level set like this as you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.839 
sensitivity level set like this as you
can<00:04:28.520> see<00:04:28.849> my<00:04:29.150> audio<00:04:29.599> is<00:04:29.840> moving<00:04:30.550> without<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
can see my audio is moving without the

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.969 
can see my audio is moving without the
needles<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.479> vinyl<00:04:33.110> moving

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
needles and vinyl moving

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.820 
needles and vinyl moving
it's<00:04:34.669> simply<00:04:35.180> moving<00:04:35.419> because<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:36.110> my<00:04:36.470> voice

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
it's simply moving because of my voice

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.879 
it's simply moving because of my voice
the<00:04:37.190> needles<00:04:37.610> are<00:04:37.729> catching<00:04:38.090> my<00:04:38.210> voice<00:04:38.449> and

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
the needles are catching my voice and

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.100 
the needles are catching my voice and
since<00:04:39.889> it's<00:04:40.129> set<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.729> be<00:04:40.940> as<00:04:41.150> sensitive<00:04:41.599> as<00:04:41.870> can

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
since it's set to be as sensitive as can

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
since it's set to be as sensitive as can
be<00:04:42.400> this<00:04:43.400> is<00:04:43.580> enough<00:04:43.909> to<00:04:44.240> move<00:04:44.509> your<00:04:44.810> audio

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
be this is enough to move your audio

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.740 
be this is enough to move your audio
imagine<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:46.759> happens<00:04:47.360> when<00:04:47.599> you're

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
imagine if that happens when you're

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.709 
imagine if that happens when you're
playing<00:04:48.110> in<00:04:48.379> a<00:04:48.560> club<00:04:48.969> that's<00:04:49.969> not<00:04:50.270> what<00:04:50.599> you

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
playing in a club that's not what you

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:51.820 
playing in a club that's not what you
want<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.289> happen

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
want to see happen

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.480 
want to see happen
so<00:04:52.039> this<00:04:52.759> is<00:04:52.909> way<00:04:53.090> too<00:04:53.150> sensitive<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.490> make

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
so this is way too sensitive so make

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.029 
so this is way too sensitive so make
sure<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:55.969> test<00:04:56.300> this<00:04:56.599> hold<00:04:57.319> that<00:04:57.560> estimate

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
sure you test this hold that estimate

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.010 
sure you test this hold that estimate

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
playing you see it already went way up

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.959 
playing you see it already went way up
just<00:05:01.699> by<00:05:02.060> my<00:05:02.240> voice<00:05:02.449> but<00:05:03.580> make<00:05:04.580> sure<00:05:04.610> there's

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
just by my voice but make sure there's

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.529

music<00:05:05.379> playing<00:05:06.379> at<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.129> same<00:05:07.550> level<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.210> it

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
music playing at the same level that it

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.529 
music playing at the same level that it
would<00:05:08.659> be<00:05:08.750> playing<00:05:09.110> at<00:05:09.440> night<00:05:10.340> or<00:05:11.030> if<00:05:11.389> you're

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
would be playing at night or if you're

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.209 
would be playing at night or if you're
coming<00:05:11.750> in<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.110> there's<00:05:12.469> already<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.889> DJ

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
coming in and there's already a DJ

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.399 
coming in and there's already a DJ
playing<00:05:13.490> then<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.270> noise<00:05:14.659> is<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.110> be<00:05:15.199> at

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
playing then the noise is going to be at

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.709 
playing then the noise is going to be at
that<00:05:15.440> level<00:05:15.830> already<00:05:16.310> if<00:05:17.180> you're<00:05:17.419> testing

that level already if you're testing

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.129 
that level already if you're testing
this<00:05:17.870> without<00:05:18.080> sound<00:05:18.909> playing<00:05:19.909> you<00:05:20.870> got<00:05:21.020> to

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
this without sound playing you got to

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.339 
this without sound playing you got to
make<00:05:21.259> the<00:05:21.409> noise<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:22.009> use<00:05:22.699> one<00:05:23.000> turntable<00:05:23.630> to

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
make the noise so use one turntable to

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.930 
make the noise so use one turntable to
play<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.710> music<00:05:25.659> so<00:05:26.659> for<00:05:27.020> instance<00:05:27.849> happy<00:05:28.849> you

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
play the music so for instance happy you

play that loud here right now but play
it<00:05:36.080> on<00:05:36.289> one<00:05:36.469> deck<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:36.949> then<00:05:37.430> test<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.880> other

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
it on one deck and then test the other

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.939 
it on one deck and then test the other
deck<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:39.159> after<00:05:40.159> that<00:05:40.310> switch<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.330> around

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
deck and after that switch it around

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.959 
deck and after that switch it around

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
play music on this deck and test this

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.159 
play music on this deck and test this
deck<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:49.430> those<00:05:50.240> are<00:05:50.419> two<00:05:50.599> things<00:05:50.840> you<00:05:50.990> need<00:05:51.050> to

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
deck so those are two things you need to

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.439 
deck so those are two things you need to
check<00:05:51.440> make<00:05:51.770> sure<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:52.310> your<00:05:52.460> control<00:05:52.969> signal

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
check make sure that your control signal

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.600 
check make sure that your control signal
is<00:05:53.659> being<00:05:53.900> received<00:05:53.990> correctly<00:05:54.889> by<00:05:55.009> sarado

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
is being received correctly by sarado

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.600 
is being received correctly by sarado
and<00:05:55.759> set<00:05:56.659> the<00:05:56.750> sensitivity<00:05:57.110> level<00:05:57.770> that's<00:05:58.400> all

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
and set the sensitivity level that's all

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.790 
and set the sensitivity level that's all
you<00:05:58.729> need<00:05:58.879> to<00:05:58.940> do<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.449> calibrate<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.229> took<00:06:00.680> my

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
you need to do to calibrate I took my

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.260 
you need to do to calibrate I took my
time<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.039> explain<00:06:01.490> but<00:06:01.550> you<00:06:01.789> can<00:06:01.940> see<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.210> you

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
time to explain but you can see that you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.240 
time to explain but you can see that you
can<00:06:02.389> do<00:06:02.509> this<00:06:02.629> quite<00:06:02.960> fast<00:06:03.289> and<00:06:03.590> normally<00:06:04.069> it

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
can do this quite fast and normally it

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.249 
can do this quite fast and normally it
takes<00:06:04.490> me<00:06:04.699> like<00:06:04.849> 30<00:06:05.240> seconds<00:06:05.750> to<00:06:05.870> have<00:06:05.990> this

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
takes me like 30 seconds to have this

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.860 
takes me like 30 seconds to have this
done<00:06:06.560> alright<00:06:07.550> guys<00:06:07.819> that's<00:06:08.180> it<00:06:08.389> that's<00:06:08.629> all

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
done alright guys that's it that's all

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.480 
done alright guys that's it that's all
you<00:06:08.990> need<00:06:09.139> to<00:06:09.229> know<00:06:09.409> now<00:06:09.949> you<00:06:10.009> can<00:06:10.250> calibrate

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
you need to know now you can calibrate

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.180 
you need to know now you can calibrate
your<00:06:10.879> DJ<00:06:11.180> set<00:06:11.449> with<00:06:11.659> Serato<00:06:12.020> Scratch<00:06:12.169> Live<00:06:12.740> and

your DJ set with Serato Scratch Live and

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.029 
your DJ set with Serato Scratch Live and
do<00:06:14.029> this<00:06:14.240> before<00:06:14.690> every<00:06:15.050> gig<00:06:15.289> because<00:06:15.800> that

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
do this before every gig because that

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.300 
do this before every gig because that
control<00:06:16.490> signal<00:06:16.969> needs<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.449> reach<00:06:17.629> Cerato

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
control signal needs to reach Cerato

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.180 
control signal needs to reach Cerato
correctly<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:20.409> make<00:06:21.409> sure<00:06:21.560> that<00:06:21.800> you<00:06:21.949> check

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
correctly and make sure that you check

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.769 
correctly and make sure that you check
your<00:06:22.219> equipment<00:06:22.610> if<00:06:23.029> you're<00:06:23.180> not<00:06:23.330> getting<00:06:23.659> the

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779 
your equipment if you're not getting the

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.219 
your equipment if you're not getting the
correct<00:06:24.080> signal<00:06:24.560> so<00:06:25.099> it<00:06:25.729> could<00:06:26.060> be<00:06:26.089> an<00:06:26.539> RCA

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
correct signal so it could be an RCA

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.779 
correct signal so it could be an RCA
cable<00:06:27.680> that's<00:06:27.860> not<00:06:28.099> plugged<00:06:28.370> in<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.610> right

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789
