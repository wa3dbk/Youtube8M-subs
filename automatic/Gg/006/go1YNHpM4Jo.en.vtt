um<00:00:18.470> we'll<00:00:19.470> start<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.830> 20<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:20.369> we'll<00:00:20.490> see

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
um we'll start at 20 and then we'll see

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460 
um we'll start at 20 and then we'll see
what<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> minute<00:00:21.630> we'll<00:00:22.289> see

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
what we can get in a minute we'll see

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.730 
what we can get in a minute we'll see
how<00:00:22.650> many<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> minute<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.150> um

for the profit to calculate the profit
per<00:00:27.300> hour<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.109> will<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.529> ending<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:30.060> at

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
per hour so we will be ending this at

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450 
per hour so we will be ending this at
120<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> calculate<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> profit<00:00:32.130> per

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

hour they're not ending it but stop

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
hour they're not ending it but stop
doing<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> calculate<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> profit

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
doing it just to calculate the profit

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270 
doing it just to calculate the profit
per<00:00:35.940> hour<00:00:36.059> we'll<00:00:36.750> probably<00:00:36.960> um<00:00:37.410> yeah<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> don't

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
per hour we'll probably um yeah I don't

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
per hour we'll probably um yeah I don't
know<00:00:38.460> we'll<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.480> will<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

you can tell while I'm doing this I make

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
you can tell while I'm doing this I make
I'm<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> clicking<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.239> make

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
I'm just clicking on them just to make

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
I'm just clicking on them just to make
sure<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:49.200> i'm<00:00:49.320> trying<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> quickest

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
sure that i'm trying to get the quickest

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.029 
sure that i'm trying to get the quickest
profit<00:00:50.610> per<00:00:50.760> hour<00:00:50.879> by<00:00:51.449> getting<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> done<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:53.010> i

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
um 750 of this let's see what these

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.350 
um 750 of this let's see what these
equal<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> goes<00:01:30.350> 31<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.590> 247<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.150> let's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
equal so it goes 31 in 247 now let's

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.980 
equal so it goes 31 in 247 now let's
pull<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> calculator<00:01:34.880> calc<00:01:35.880> cook<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pull up the calculator calc cook it up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
pull up the calculator calc cook it up
the<00:01:37.170> doubt<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> doubt<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> thou<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.060> we'll<00:01:39.210> go

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the doubt to doubt that thou so we'll go

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.490 
the doubt to doubt that thou so we'll go
14<00:01:41.240> times<00:01:42.380> how<00:01:43.380> many<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.740> use<00:01:44.479> 750<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
14 times how many we use 750 so this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.550 
14 times how many we use 750 so this
remember<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.920> oh<00:01:50.810> crap<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.439> wit

10 500 to 320 2 325 oh this is a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.620 
10 500 to 320 2 325 oh this is a
patience<00:02:13.460> for<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> minute<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.030> 2<00:02:14.660> 3<00:02:15.260> 250<00:02:17.560> 2<00:02:18.560> 3<00:02:19.360> 250

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:35.440 

turns<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:28.780> 235<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.610> right<00:02:34.850> there<00:02:34.910> is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
turns in 235 so that right there is

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.710 
turns in 235 so that right there is
around<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.140> 12k<00:02:37.010> profit<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.820> minute<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.570> this

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
around a 12k profit in a minute so this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.900 
around a 12k profit in a minute so this
equals<00:02:38.960> out<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.320> around<00:02:39.500> 700<00:02:40.160> 20k<00:02:40.640> per<00:02:40.790> hour

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
equals out to be around 700 20k per hour

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.000 
equals out to be around 700 20k per hour
which<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.630> actually<00:02:41.810> pretty<00:02:42.140> pretty<00:02:42.740> good
