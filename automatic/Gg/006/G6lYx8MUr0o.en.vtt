 then you will have what you think about it separately 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 how do you make it into us one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.879
 but then it hides and produces not a project 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.730
 read 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:22.300
 here's what I wanted to be wind 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:30.910
 carry thoughts 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 give voice to those who can't find one yet 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.969
 time with the soul at the end 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 other faces other languages other stories 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.690
 but my land was joined by a poem 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.489
 late 19th century English on lawn 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:54.649
 my city here too, how strange but 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.649
 maybe it was a sign 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.269
 I wanted that book but someone had me 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.269
 social 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.299
 no 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:22.790
 a writer who was working on one 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:28.040
 script on the grass sack of 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.770
 back home again at work but col 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.550
 always thinking of that tragic summer 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.250
 of 1512 to the responsibilities of the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.400
 family doctors and the republic 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.400
 Florentine 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.330
 to the never-dormant rivalries seemed to me 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
 even to hear the voices of the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.610
 victims from every corner of the city 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 ancient from the beautiful churches embroidered from the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.369
 green serpentine marble where it was sought 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.970
 uselessly shelter from the homicidal fury 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:10.420
 of its stable data 5,000 perhaps 6,000 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.600
 the victims to bloodless citizens 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.860
 innocent poured between these caskets 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.819
 art full of hidden treasures treasures a 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.280
 sometimes exhibited the city walls that 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.430
 they became a death trap 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.380
 but some say that things did not go 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.350
