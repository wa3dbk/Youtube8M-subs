 way of television more color and the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 truth is to work with one of my 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.500
 best members of this team that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:21.800
 they take my beloved take to the program that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.800
 boy 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 and this boy thanks to him we do all 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.050

 kitchen works like this we hold 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 together working both at the same 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 time and good what happens if I have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 then we have the option to be a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 customer aruba like what are we going to do 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 it's very fast in two minutes 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.980
 baked and the truth you know what are the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.480
 options that one has for example if you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.039
 you are not suddenly invited that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 explains and the mother-in-law if the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.800
 school by itself there is the expectation that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 there is not a good thing to do the daughter-in-law 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 because I do not like it, but after 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.470

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.350
 once it is fillet he is now 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.370
 very easy to make it exceeded the market going 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.340
 to ask for a steak of steaks 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.490
 If that's how you get the dollars to have the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.410
 head and this the part of the tip of the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.800
 tip with the tips we can make for 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.150

 public to the plate of the chilaquiles 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.890
 good and we have we need that 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.700
 we need to bring them a cup of oil 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.759
 olive 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 nothing more and nothing more 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.890
 They do not know how spectacular they will 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.400
 returning you will love it will be your 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 fillet is here pure as hidden 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.280
 it's a recipe so it said that it gives me 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.280
 a little more 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.250
 we are ready we are going to put it 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.220
 over and immediately you 're going to go to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.690
 oven we will not let it marinate because 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.460
 it's too much the solution is can you know 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.770
 if they fix or supply you with windsor 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.270
 lie has absolutely nothing with 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.340
 soybeans with enough soy 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.960
 exactly and now what we 're going to do 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.980
 is to cover it perfectly thanks to take 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.140
 let's cover and then we'll go to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.310
 smell value not at an average temperature of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.530
 the tf if 350 180 yes exactly and as 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.050
 how long will it be like half an hour of 30 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.170
 at 40 minutes exactly for half not 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.300
 more or less and about 45 50 for a 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.430
 little bit more red after red than 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.290
 is medium and then well known that I 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 when we are fillet there is no need 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.010
 consume it well cooked you lose the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.200
 taste of the meat and the truth is not worth the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.600
 sorry then so much spent on a steak 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.209
