00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.859
 NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 really made an audio recording of the meeting 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 with Vladimir Putin in 2002 about this 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 declared the danish documentary filmmaker 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 christopher gold brunson he reported that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.199
 personally secured the microphone on the clothes then 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.810
 still prime minister denmark audio recording 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250
 became part of the fox movie backstage at 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
 By the way there are the same ones 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 the way other world leaders say about 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 how the habit was born 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 eavesdrop on Catherine Zorin Scandal 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 which was not expected on a straight line 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 president of russia from berlin studio 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.510
 question about the relationship between Russia and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
 Europe and America how to build them 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 confidentially in the modern world Vladimir 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 Putin on the issue of trust has answered 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 personal example you know here today 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 NATO Secretary General 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 mister rammuson he was once an example 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.610
 me example places yes none of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.320
 meeting 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 when he was still prime minister of denmark 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 she asked me about this meeting 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.020
 was scheduled 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.280
 I agreed we met talked 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 it turns out he took with him a tape recorder 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.650
 mystery recorded our conversation and then 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.220
 published in the press 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 I could not believe my ears and eyes 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 some sort of crap he explained it so 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.180
 recorded this conversation for the story but 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.790
 often write down for a story I'm flattered 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 of course but you should have wanted 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.049
 warn or even ask 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.680
 permission to publish these these 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.950
 conversation 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 Well, what confidence can arise 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.860
 after such incidents based on 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.630
 in every sense it was far away in 2002 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 no recorded conversation 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 state secrets rather secular 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.079
 conversation from the sidelines but the fact that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.079
 the press service immediately tried 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 refute and in what tone these accusations 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.369
 complete nonsense 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.600
 during his tenure, 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.909
 Danish Prime Minister Mr. Fogh 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 rasmussen didn't wear an owl voice recorder for 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.380
 meeting records with Mr Putin or with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.329
 did anyone else have a chance 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.969
 avoid confusion but press secretary 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.040
 organization by she langet continued 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.610
 already on the favorite topic of the last 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.710
 months 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.959
 Russia puts forward unreasonable 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 an accusation to distract 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.760
 public from their wrongful 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.410
 Action in Ukraine is nothing more in NATO 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.840
 did not have time to declare to their own 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.069
 Happily responded to the situation of the media 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.440
 Danish kingdom 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.660
 journalist christophe gul francine openly 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.520
 admitted the microphone really was 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.980
 private conversation was really 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.670
 recorded words from brussels about rubbish and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.739
 complete nonsense 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.290
 awkwardly hung in the European air 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.180
 the thing is, I attached a microphone 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.220
 costume at anders foog rasmussen up 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.959
 meeting with the press in brussels so 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.610
 way when the meeting ended with 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.080
 press rasmus he was still with 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.269
 microphone including during 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.340
 private conversation with Vladimir Putin 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.010
 it was recorded and later 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.200
 used film knew whether rasmuson on 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.700
 the moment that the words are written specially 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.190
 left the microphone on 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.769
 or just forgot to shoot but here are the footage from 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 mentioned movie reporters just as well 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.489
 overhears a conversation with the then 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 President of France Jacques Chirac 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.480
 in the course leshrac that said when 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.310
 Witnesses are unclear, but this time Rasmus 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 he should have known for sure and now 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 another question is it worth trusting 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.290
 other statements for this or that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.630
 principles of modern european 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.190
 politicians uncomfortable truth is always possible 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.290
 hide behind a loud voice 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.700
 convincing tone of Catherine Zorin 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.700
 Yevgeny Zhuravlyov to lead
