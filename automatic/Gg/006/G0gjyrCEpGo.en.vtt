00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.200
 we already saw it is extraordinary love 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.420
 what he has for his family and the meaning 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.519
 that the family gives even though it has neither 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.590
 a penny that's what's important what 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.200
 are transmitting then the guy is a 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 virtuous in what he does because he has a 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.870
 musical sense is interpreted to encourage a 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.909
 talentazo hopefully and that this is for good 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.409
 of which the one that does go is more there 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.409

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.799
 the studios for talent and in addition 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.019
 this author 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.109
 if any one music someone this 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.319

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.359

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.709

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.620
 Family concept has it well 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.959
 identified and now better look for removes 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.730
 that sometimes the money channel does not 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.120
 the love to the family 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.609
 as the sexy is seen in our 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.280
 compositions and most importantly I think 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.049
 that the desire and the attitude that the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.389
 attractive because anyone could be 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.310
 the situations in which they live are not 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.560
 the best and are not what they should 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.480
 to be living and in spite of everything 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.590
 follow with a smile keeps coming to 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.150
