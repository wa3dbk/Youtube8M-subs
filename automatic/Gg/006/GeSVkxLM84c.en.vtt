high school and I'm trying to see if
that<00:00:55.050> could<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> potential<00:00:55.800> take<00:00:55.980> off

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that could have the potential take off

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.799 
that could have the potential take off
cuz<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.699> something<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.390> wish<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.629> had

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
when I was in high school and I think

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
when I was in high school and I think
has<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> potential<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> national<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
has the potential to be a national you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290 
has the potential to be a national you
know<00:01:01.949> national<00:01:02.190> club<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> could<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
know national club and could be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
know national club and could be
something<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.750> par<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.140> FIRST<00:01:04.799> Robotics

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
something on par with FIRST Robotics

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.820 
something on par with FIRST Robotics
where<00:01:05.600> they<00:01:06.600> give<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.140> 13<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> 16

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
where they give out like 13 to 16
