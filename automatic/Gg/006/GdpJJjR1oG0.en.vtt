00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Well we will accompany this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.410
 according to what we have learned today and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.780
 the imi that is with those who will combine 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 While we will accompany with a rhythm 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.900
 this time the rhythm instead of doing as 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 in the previous lessons we did 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 hits on 1 2 3 and 4 and then we would go 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.920
 getting a blow in between what 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 let's do it's going to be give all the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 knocks up and down and then let's go 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 seeing what we remove is to say we are going to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.689
 follow the opposite process for the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.750
 first of the rhythms what are we going to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 do for now this lady do not forget 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.989
 to take the game we put it to the core of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 wait for now let's concentrate 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 in the right hand to do the rhythm 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 let's count as always four in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.739
 four and kicking with the foot and the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.329
 first of the rhythms will be very easy 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.329
 because because we are going to count 1 and 2 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 and wa and that is to say in all the numbers and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 in all and let us not give blows 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 let's jump none matches that the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 we always touch them with our hands 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 down and with a punch standing towards 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.909
 down and and we touch them up and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 lifting the leg upwards to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 take the next stroke then again 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.649
 slowly 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:29.939
 and 2 and 3 and wii and this rhythm is very easy 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.100
 do it a couple of times of space to 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.110
 that you take the coordination between the hand 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.119
 and the leg but it 's very easy then 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.860
 let's go putting chords we're going to 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.220
 start with the chord of two we do 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.429
 four we counted four times in 24 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 times in the four times in me and 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.729
 four times in the space after the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.280
 first time and then we do it more 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.890
 Quick 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.890
 and 2003 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.860
 two 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.659
 3 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.270
 Y 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.960
 two 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 3 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 3 and let's start again 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:27.320
 3 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.320
 and 2003 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.730
 2 and 3 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.910
 and the least 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910
 two 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.650
 and how do you see this rhythm as well touched 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.030
 slow does not have much grace would be much 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.030
 more interesting a little faster 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.570
 but at the moment practiced slow and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.010
 when you have done it many times already 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.080
 it will go faster even if you do not want 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.250
 these things are going to come out quickly because it's 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.740
 what you have to do at the beginning you have to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.350
 play it slow many times until 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.940
 your hand can not do it almost without 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.410
 think good you can try this rhythm 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.180
 with these chords that we have done now 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.560
 you can try them with the other 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.350
 combination that we said it was 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.050
 just the other way around was on my side 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.630
 and starting from me instead of from 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.340
 You can also do it and you can do it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.050
 do for example with those who 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.610
 we were doing in the previous election that was 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.610
 in the imm and only 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.050
 well let's do a second rhythm 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.180
 based a bit on the first but this 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.220
 instead of giving all the blows down 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.320
 and top down and up what we're going to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.990
 do is going to be that some of the hits 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.300
 we are going to raise it, that is, we are not going to 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.250
 to touch the strings we are going to jump one 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.890
 of the blows let's do it for 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.470
 example in the fourth time so that we 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.620
 give more time in this hand to change 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:11.530
 chord 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:14.440
 we make a goal and two or three or four and the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.840
 level 4 we do it without touching the strings 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.600
 that is, we raise our hands to go back to 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.470
 give the next one that comes but without 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.610
 touch the strings 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:31.330
 I repeat one and two and three and ward and one and 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.790
 two and three and four 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.940
 and then let's try it with the 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.410
 chords we start equal to the same two 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.410
 mine and the vale 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.850
 two 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.699
 and 2003 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.950
 2 and 3 by 2 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.580
 and waves 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.840
 i 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.360
 Y 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.950
 As you can see, it is very similar to the rhythm 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.740
 previous but it sounds a lot more 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.940
 interesting simply because of the fact 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.340
 take a hit from doing it a little 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.920
 different and we're going to do a third rhythm 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.920
 very similar to this this time we are going to 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.600
 remove the stroke in 4 and in 2 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:48.660
 it is also to say that the rhythm is going to 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:54.330
 remain so that 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:57.210
 and 3 and 4 and we're going to try it with the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.430
 chords and remember to go putting the foot 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.210
 along with the numbers and with the and 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.210
 we raise 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.410
 and 2 3 and 4 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 2. 3 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.659
 3 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.750
 2. 3 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.740
 23 23 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 2. 3 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.420
 2. 3 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.670
 and the same as with the first beat this 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.290
 it sounds a lot more interesting when 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.600
 you have done a couple of days you have it 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.289
 well practiced and you get to do it a 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.889
 little faster 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.889
 all right 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.610
 so you already know, practicing a lot 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.009
 every day repeated all thousand times 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.569
 I was going to come a point where you do 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.430
 things like change of agreement is going to 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.169
 seem the most natural thing in the world and what 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.840
 more important for that because it is to have the 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.990
 guitar well by hand do not save it much 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.639
 Do not put it in the closet but leave it well 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.190
 near your desk or leave it 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.289
 where you see it lest you cost 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.090
 in a moment that you are even a 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.280
 minute, pick up the guitar, it's a little bit 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.440
 and you have already done more than if you have it 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.789
 in the closet and you're not even 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.409
 seeing the most important thing is 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:38.360
 practice a little every day and not 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:40.039
 give up even if today we do not get the 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.680
 chords because as I tell you this is something 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.050
 that takes weeks and months of practice 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.000
 so do not pretend that everything comes out 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.830
 well at first this is a process of 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.900
 to be learning to go improving 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.060
 correcting and especially so practice 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.979
 a little bit every day because this has 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.409
 been everything for today I remind you that you have 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:59.599
 the well-ordered lessons on the blog 

00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:01.340
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.729
 video and nothing else we see in the 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.729
 next choice
