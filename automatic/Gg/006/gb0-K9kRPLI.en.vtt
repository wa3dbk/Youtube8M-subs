00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
minutes and 30 seconds of awkwardness I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.569 
minutes and 30 seconds of awkwardness I
think<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.439> gonna<00:01:37.530> trim<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> down<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> bit

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
think I'm gonna trim it down a bit

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.830 
think I'm gonna trim it down a bit
because<00:01:39.500> maybe<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.329> it's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.509> slow

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
because maybe it like it's a little slow

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.139 
because maybe it like it's a little slow
in<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:43.229> spots<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.670> gonna<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.970> my<00:01:45.119> best

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
in some spots but I'm gonna do my best

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
in some spots but I'm gonna do my best
and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.689> got<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> color<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.950> sound

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and then I got to color it and do sound

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
and then I got to color it and do sound
I<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.149> I'm<00:01:48.210> gonna<00:01:48.299> add<00:01:48.509> any<00:01:48.869> music

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I don't think I'm gonna add any music

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.330 
I don't think I'm gonna add any music
whatsoever

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
whatsoever

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
whatsoever
just<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:52.140> it'll<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.680> away

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just because I think it'll take away

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.950 
just because I think it'll take away
from<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> awkwardness<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.299> music<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
from the awkwardness because music is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.289 
from the awkwardness because music is
kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> thing<00:01:55.860> sometimes<00:01:56.159> which<00:01:56.850> helps

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
kind of a thing sometimes which helps

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
kind of a thing sometimes which helps
the<00:01:57.930> mood<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> helps<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.460> feel<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the mood and it helps the feel of it and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.380 
the mood and it helps the feel of it and
