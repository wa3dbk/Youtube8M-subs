I finished why I decided to go with the
willow<00:03:12.540> as<00:03:12.810> opposed<00:03:13.199> to<00:03:13.439> this<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.159> other

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:17.759 
thing is you could use before the leaf

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
starts in its beer form like this thing

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.219 
starts in its beer form like this thing
I<00:03:19.859> really<00:03:20.280> love<00:03:20.489> using<00:03:20.759> the<00:03:21.329> fresh<00:03:21.599> willow<00:03:21.870> end

I really love using the fresh willow end
with<00:03:22.500> my<00:03:22.709> designing<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.819> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
with my designing and because of the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.909 
with my designing and because of the
little<00:03:24.209> when<00:03:24.599> once<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.349> gets<00:03:25.530> into<00:03:25.709> that

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
little when once it gets into that

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.229 
little when once it gets into that
moisture<00:03:26.340> through<00:03:26.519> those<00:03:26.699> little<00:03:27.000> leaves

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
moisture through those little leaves

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.479 
moisture through those little leaves
camera<00:03:27.659> can<00:03:28.229> sort<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.620> into<00:03:28.859> their<00:03:29.009> own<00:03:29.189> and<00:03:29.400> it

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
camera can sort of into their own and it

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.429 
camera can sort of into their own and it
sort<00:03:29.729> of<00:03:29.759> continues<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.419> grow<00:03:30.629> or<00:03:30.989> love<00:03:31.259> that

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
they're two deer and then let's just

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.270 
they're two deer and then let's just
bring<00:04:08.939> that<00:04:09.000> down<00:04:09.959> into<00:04:10.199> there<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.949> that<00:04:11.129> when

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
bring that down into there so that when

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
bring that down into there so that when
you<00:04:11.459> look<00:04:11.729> at<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:11.939> what's<00:04:12.120> actually<00:04:12.329> happening

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you look at it what's actually happening

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.539 
you look at it what's actually happening
is<00:04:12.840> they<00:04:13.169> sort<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.409> like<00:04:13.590> stepping<00:04:14.069> down<00:04:14.280> and

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
is they sort of like stepping down and

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.949 
is they sort of like stepping down and
around<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:14.939> could<00:04:15.090> take<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.479> little<00:04:15.780> bit

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
around you could take that a little bit

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.689 
around you could take that a little bit
lower<00:04:16.199> if<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.380> wanted<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.219> I<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.579> it's

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
lower if you wanted to but I think it's

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.029 
lower if you wanted to but I think it's
fine<00:04:17.909> for<00:04:17.969> their<00:04:18.299> right<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.079> also<00:04:19.530> said<00:04:20.009> that

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
fine for their right you also said that

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.279 
fine for their right you also said that
you<00:04:20.250> had<00:04:20.430> some<00:04:20.609> succulents<00:04:20.880> not<00:04:21.779> quite<00:04:22.049> like

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
you had some succulents not quite like

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.870 
you had some succulents not quite like
yours<00:04:22.560> but<00:04:22.680> quite<00:04:22.949> nice<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.310> actually<00:04:23.490> like

yours but quite nice and I actually like

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.790 
yours but quite nice and I actually like
the<00:04:24.060> thought<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.409> using<00:04:25.409> these<00:04:25.529> that<00:04:25.680> was<00:04:25.770> a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
the thought of using these that was a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.440 
the thought of using these that was a
good<00:04:26.099> selection<00:04:26.430> tea

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450

as<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.480> was<00:04:57.750> saying<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.620> like<00:04:58.980> that<00:04:59.190> actually

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
as I was saying I do like that actually

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.920 
as I was saying I do like that actually
this<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.700> better<00:05:00.030> than<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.360> thought<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.840> was

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
this is better than I thought it was

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.300 
this is better than I thought it was
going<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.200> go<00:05:01.320> just<00:05:01.500> take<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.770> down<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:02.190> a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
going to go just take that down just a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.280 
going to go just take that down just a
little<00:05:02.340> bit<00:05:02.700> shorter<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.570> if<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.990> had<00:05:04.260> a

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
little bit shorter and if you had a

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.440 
little bit shorter and if you had a
fourth<00:05:04.740> one<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.460> could<00:05:05.610> perhaps<00:05:05.790> put<00:05:06.240> that

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
fourth one you could perhaps put that

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.900 
fourth one you could perhaps put that
into<00:05:06.660> there<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.230> a<00:05:07.260> lovely<00:05:07.770> little<00:05:07.920> plane<00:05:08.730> of

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
into there that a lovely little plane of

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
it into there now as I was saying I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.390 
it into there now as I was saying I
could<00:05:33.570> have<00:05:33.600> used<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.290> beautiful<00:05:35.160> berry

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
here and it does work because those

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.390 
here and it does work because those
blackberries<00:05:36.960> they<00:05:37.440> just<00:05:37.710> do<00:05:37.890> connect<00:05:38.250> in

blackberries they just do connect in

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000 
blackberries they just do connect in
with<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:39.480> what<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.440> thought<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.919> I'll

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
with that that what I thought and I'll

with that that what I thought and I'll
show<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.340> what<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.520> mean<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.910> feel<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.690> it's

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
show you what I mean I feel that it's

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.530 
show you what I mean I feel that it's
just<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.440> little<00:05:43.710> bit<00:05:43.860> too<00:05:44.100> messy<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.360> you

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
just a little bit too messy so if you

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.260 
just a little bit too messy so if you
either<00:05:45.780> everand<00:05:46.620> out<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:47.490> way<00:05:47.669> forward<00:05:48.030> is

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
either everand out the way forward is

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.330 
either everand out the way forward is
leave<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.960> out<00:05:49.200> but<00:05:49.620> I<00:05:49.680> think<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.220> is

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
leave it out but I think that that is

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.790 
leave it out but I think that that is
