bolt out with a pitman arm polar looks

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.420 
bolt out with a pitman arm polar looks
like<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
like this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.780 
like this

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
and you can attach a ratchet to this and

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.930 
and you can attach a ratchet to this and
it'll<00:01:00.120> move<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:02.010> piece<00:01:02.310> upwards<00:01:03.500> pushing

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
it'll move this piece upwards pushing

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.140 
it'll move this piece upwards pushing
this<00:01:05.940> screw<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> bolt<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
this screw or this bolt up and out of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
this screw or this bolt up and out of
the<00:01:09.330> control<00:01:09.540> arm<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:11.820> useful

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the control arm so this is a very useful

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.190 
the control arm so this is a very useful
tool<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:14.190> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.670> an<00:01:14.760> extra

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
ten or so dollars to spend I would

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
ten or so dollars to spend I would
highly<00:01:18.930> recommend<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> set

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
highly recommend it you can get the set

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.620 
highly recommend it you can get the set
auto<00:01:20.910> zone<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:23.120> make<00:01:24.120> sure<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.480> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
auto zone and make sure you get the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
auto zone and make sure you get the
smaller<00:01:25.050> one<00:01:25.640> because<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.730> bigger<00:01:26.910> one<00:01:27.090> will

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
smaller one because the bigger one will

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
smaller one because the bigger one will
be<00:01:27.330> too<00:01:27.510> big<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.800> cars<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.840> believe

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
be too big for our cars and I believe

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.430 
be too big for our cars and I believe
the<00:01:31.650> part<00:01:31.860> number<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.130> 2<00:01:32.310> 7<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> 0<00:01:33.060> 2<00:01:33.540> 2<00:01:33.960> for

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the part number is 2 7 and 0 2 2 for

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.109 
the part number is 2 7 and 0 2 2 for
this<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.550> sure<00:01:35.580> get<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> smaller

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this one so make sure get the smaller

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.340 
this one so make sure get the smaller
one<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.100> it'll<00:01:38.100> work<00:01:38.220> great<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
used the pitman arm polar to push that

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.559 
used the pitman arm polar to push that
bolt<00:02:59.510> on<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.110> control<00:03:00.799> arm<00:03:01.160> or<00:03:01.519> sorry<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
this old ball joint here and replace it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.009 
this old ball joint here and replace it
with<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.319> new<00:03:12.440> one<00:03:13.450> what<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> did<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> other

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
with a new one what I did on the other

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.910 
with a new one what I did on the other
side<00:03:15.500> which<00:03:15.860> somehow<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.730> worked<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.829> was<00:03:18.829> able

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
side which somehow it worked I was able

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.490 
side which somehow it worked I was able
to<00:03:19.040> loosen<00:03:19.370> these<00:03:19.690> not<00:03:20.690> all<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> way<00:03:21.019> not<00:03:21.230> sick

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
to loosen these not all the way not sick

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.170 
to loosen these not all the way not sick
don't<00:03:21.650> take<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:21.920> all<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.040> way<00:03:22.130> because<00:03:22.310> Pandey

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
don't take it all the way because Pandey

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.830 
don't take it all the way because Pandey
asked<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.690> put<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.200> back<00:03:24.319> in<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.720> what<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.750> did

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
asked to put it back in so what I did

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.940 
asked to put it back in so what I did
was<00:03:27.049> loosen<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.799> bolts<00:03:30.799> here

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
was loosen it so that the bolts here

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.610 
was loosen it so that the bolts here
won't<00:03:31.239> come<00:03:32.239> off<00:03:32.269> from<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.690> control<00:03:33.200> arm<00:03:33.440> here

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
won't come off from the control arm here

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.940 
won't come off from the control arm here
and<00:03:33.739> then<00:03:34.609> using<00:03:35.569> some<00:03:36.190> muscle<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:38.410> wedged<00:03:39.410> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
and then using some muscle I wedged a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.230 
and then using some muscle I wedged a
breaker<00:03:41.760> breaker<00:03:42.480> bar<00:03:42.750> between<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:45.060> lower

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
breaker breaker bar between the lower

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.820 
breaker breaker bar between the lower
control<00:03:45.480> arm<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.750> tie<00:03:48.750> rod<00:03:48.990> here<00:03:49.470> I

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
control arm here and the tie rod here I

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.500 
control arm here and the tie rod here I
don't<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.610> is<00:03:50.640> recommended<00:03:51.300> though

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
don't know if this is recommended though

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.290 
don't know if this is recommended though
because<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.350> could<00:03:52.709> be<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:53.250> sensitive<00:03:53.880> part

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
because this could be a sensitive part

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.750 
because this could be a sensitive part
although<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.080> built<00:03:55.319> strongly<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.640> is

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
although it is built strongly it is

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.199 
although it is built strongly it is
definitely<00:03:57.560> something<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.740> can<00:03:59.640> get<00:03:59.910> out<00:03:59.940> of

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
definitely something that can get out of

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.680 
definitely something that can get out of
alignment<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.640> if<00:04:02.640> that's<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:03.209> something<00:04:03.510> you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
alignment so if that's not something you

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.530 
alignment so if that's not something you
want<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:05.030> what<00:04:06.030> other<00:04:06.180> people<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.510> done

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
want to do what other people have done

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.160 
want to do what other people have done
is<00:04:07.080> take<00:04:07.590> off<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.890> control<00:04:08.190> incompletely<00:04:09.170> and

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
is take off the control incompletely and

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.320 
is take off the control incompletely and
then<00:04:10.380> go<00:04:10.800> from<00:04:10.920> there<00:04:11.160> I've<00:04:11.760> never<00:04:11.819> done<00:04:12.180> that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
then go from there I've never done that

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.819 
then go from there I've never done that
so<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:13.110> can't<00:04:13.770> say<00:04:14.540> how<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.750> works<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.650> this

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
so I can't say how that works but this

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.819 
so I can't say how that works but this
is<00:04:16.919> what<00:04:17.070> I'm<00:04:17.160> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.400> -<00:04:18.500> actually<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> real

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
is what I'm going to - actually the real

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.840 
is what I'm going to - actually the real
other<00:04:20.040> reason<00:04:20.340> why<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:20.489> doing<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.700> is

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
other reason why I'm doing that is

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.870 
other reason why I'm doing that is
because<00:04:20.970> I'm<00:04:21.510> replacing<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.500> tie<00:04:23.340> rod<00:04:23.580> here

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
because I'm replacing the tie rod here

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.300 
because I'm replacing the tie rod here
so<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.600> don't<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.560> care<00:04:25.680> if<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.980> gets<00:04:26.100> messed

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so I don't really care if it gets messed

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.080 
so I don't really care if it gets messed
up<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.970> messed<00:04:27.150> up<00:04:27.270> anyways<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.940> we'll<00:04:29.940> go

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
up it's messed up anyways so we'll go

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.070 
up it's messed up anyways so we'll go
from<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.600> I'll<00:04:30.780> show<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
from there and I'll show you the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.260 
from there and I'll show you the
finished<00:04:31.350> product

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
finished product

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.810 
finished product

wrestling to get the old one out but why

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.670 
wrestling to get the old one out but why
did<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.640> what<00:04:39.120> they<00:04:39.210> pushed<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:40.290> one<00:04:40.470> there

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
did was what they pushed that one there

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.070 
did was what they pushed that one there
it<00:04:40.770> goes<00:04:40.980> once<00:04:41.640> this<00:04:42.300> gets<00:04:42.480> pushed<00:04:42.720> out<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
it goes once this gets pushed out of the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.390 
it goes once this gets pushed out of the
way<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:45.169> whole<00:04:46.169> deck<00:04:46.320> goes<00:04:46.440> through<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
way the whole deck goes through the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.030 
way the whole deck goes through the
lower<00:04:47.640> control<00:04:47.880> arms<00:04:48.300> here<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.860> gets

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
lower control arms here that gets

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.090 
lower control arms here that gets
released<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:51.260> what<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.290> did<00:04:52.440> was<00:04:52.590> wedge<00:04:52.860> a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
released and what I did was wedge a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.210 
released and what I did was wedge a
hammer<00:04:54.060> in<00:04:54.390> between<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.590> claw<00:04:55.770> side<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.130> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
hammer in between the claw side of the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.240 
hammer in between the claw side of the
hammer<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.729> between<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.330> top<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.560> ball

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
hammer in between the top of the ball

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.909 
hammer in between the top of the ball
game<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.820> guess<00:05:00.090> would<00:05:00.300> be<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.720> flat<00:05:01.350> side<00:05:01.590> here

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
game I guess would be the flat side here

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.280 
game I guess would be the flat side here
and<00:05:02.280> then<00:05:02.850> basically<00:05:03.419> just<00:05:03.540> plot<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.650> out<00:05:04.800> or

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
and then basically just plot it out or

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.600 
and then basically just plot it out or
crowbarred<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.430> out<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.810> came<00:05:09.170> loose<00:05:09.610> so

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
crowbarred it out and that came loose so

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.790 
crowbarred it out and that came loose so
what<00:05:10.730> I'm<00:05:10.790> going<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.940> do<00:05:11.090> now<00:05:11.270> is<00:05:11.540> put<00:05:12.470> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
what I'm going to do now is put the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.130 
what I'm going to do now is put the
morph<00:05:13.760> into<00:05:13.940> fell<00:05:14.180> out<00:05:14.330> I'll<00:05:14.720> put<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.990> new

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
morph into fell out I'll put the new

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.620 
morph into fell out I'll put the new
ball<00:05:15.980> joint<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:16.910> then<00:05:17.980> put<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.070> screws<00:05:19.340> in

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
ball joint in and then put the screws in

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.210 
ball joint in and then put the screws in
won't<00:05:20.630> torque<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.170> down<00:05:21.320> yet<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.800> just

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
won't torque it down yet just just

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.590 
won't torque it down yet just just
enough<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:22.790> it<00:05:23.030> won't<00:05:23.120> fall<00:05:23.390> out<00:05:23.420> of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
enough so that it won't fall out of

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.910 
enough so that it won't fall out of
there<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.880> then<00:05:26.240> I'll<00:05:26.530> wrestle<00:05:27.530> with<00:05:27.710> the

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
there and then I'll wrestle with the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.100 
there and then I'll wrestle with the
breaker<00:05:28.700> breaker<00:05:29.300> bar<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.780> control

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
breaker breaker bar and the control

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.670 
breaker breaker bar and the control
around<00:05:30.230> again<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:31.430> get<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:32.840> last<00:05:33.050> bolt

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
around again to get the that last bolt

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.010 
around again to get the that last bolt
in<00:05:34.070> through<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.730> control<00:05:35.420> arm<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.720> then<00:05:35.900> I

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
in through the control arm and then I

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.770 
in through the control arm and then I
can<00:05:36.200> can<00:05:37.190> go<00:05:37.280> on<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.580> torquing<00:05:37.970> these<00:05:38.150> down<00:05:38.390> and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
can can go on to torquing these down and

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.580 
can can go on to torquing these down and
that<00:05:39.470> should<00:05:39.740> be<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.040> for<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.550> ball<00:05:41.060> joint

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
that should be it for the ball joint

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.320 
that should be it for the ball joint
just<00:05:42.590> few<00:05:43.100> things<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.970> want<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:45.970> be<00:05:46.970> care<00:05:47.180> to

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
just few things you want to be care to

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.020 
just few things you want to be care to
care<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.140> do<00:05:48.290> would<00:05:48.560> be<00:05:48.590> just<00:05:49.070> foot<00:05:49.490> anti-seize

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
care to do would be just foot anti-seize

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.720 
care to do would be just foot anti-seize
on<00:05:50.210> all<00:05:50.780> thread<00:05:51.290> any<00:05:51.950> parts<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.280> touching<00:05:52.610> the

on all thread any parts of touching the

on all thread any parts of touching the
river<00:05:52.940> body<00:05:53.150> would<00:05:53.510> be<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.870> good<00:05:54.080> idea<00:05:54.640> but

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
river body would be a good idea but

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.700 
river body would be a good idea but
honestly<00:05:56.120> it's<00:05:56.690> really<00:05:56.990> up<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:57.350> because

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
honestly it's really up to you because

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.080 
honestly it's really up to you because
these<00:05:58.040> parts<00:05:58.370> should<00:05:58.790> not<00:05:59.410> break<00:06:00.410> down<00:06:00.470> every

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
these parts should not break down every

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.550 
these parts should not break down every
10,000<00:06:02.090> miles<00:06:02.240> anything<00:06:02.630> like<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:02.780> I<00:06:03.230> have

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
10,000 miles anything like that I have

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.560 
10,000 miles anything like that I have
about<00:06:04.420> 135,000<00:06:05.420> miles<00:06:05.570> on<00:06:05.810> my<00:06:06.530> car<00:06:06.560> here<00:06:07.220> and

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
about 135,000 miles on my car here and

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.670 
about 135,000 miles on my car here and
these<00:06:08.570> ball<00:06:08.840> joints<00:06:09.080> were<00:06:09.140> actually<00:06:09.440> spoke

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
these ball joints were actually spoke

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.630 
these ball joints were actually spoke
pretty<00:06:09.950> good<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.220> think<00:06:10.340> so<00:06:11.230> just<00:06:12.520> something<00:06:13.520> to

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
pretty good I think so just something to

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.250 
pretty good I think so just something to
keep<00:06:14.590> keep<00:06:15.590> in<00:06:15.710> mind<00:06:16.000> so<00:06:17.000> I'm<00:06:17.570> going<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.870> go<00:06:18.200> off

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
keep keep in mind so I'm going to go off

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.890 
keep keep in mind so I'm going to go off
and<00:06:18.350> finish<00:06:18.800> this<00:06:18.950> off<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.370> show<00:06:20.360> you<00:06:20.720> the

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
and finish this off and show you the

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.020 
and finish this off and show you the
finished<00:06:21.140> product<00:06:21.350> after<00:06:21.770> that<00:06:22.000> all<00:06:23.000> right

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
finished product after that all right

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.270 
finished product after that all right
now<00:06:23.120> everything's<00:06:24.080> in<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.590> talked<00:06:24.830> down<00:06:25.070> I

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
now everything's in and talked down I

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.640 
now everything's in and talked down I
ended<00:06:26.090> up<00:06:26.150> not<00:06:26.300> having<00:06:26.660> to<00:06:26.870> loosen<00:06:27.560> these

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
ended up not having to loosen these

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.160 
ended up not having to loosen these
actually<00:06:28.070> I<00:06:28.100> loosened<00:06:28.430> them<00:06:28.520> but<00:06:28.780> both<00:06:29.780> didn't

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
actually I loosened them but both didn't

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.490 
actually I loosened them but both didn't
go<00:06:30.230> out<00:06:30.410> that<00:06:31.070> way<00:06:31.420> any<00:06:32.420> further<00:06:32.690> so<00:06:33.140> it<00:06:33.290> really

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
go out that way any further so it really

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.620 
go out that way any further so it really
didn't<00:06:33.770> do<00:06:33.860> anything<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:35.210> doesn't<00:06:35.510> make<00:06:35.600> it

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
didn't do anything it doesn't make it

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.420 
didn't do anything it doesn't make it
easier<00:06:35.990> if<00:06:36.110> it<00:06:36.200> does<00:06:36.410> flip<00:06:36.770> out<00:06:36.920> a<00:06:36.950> little<00:06:37.160> bit

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
easier if it does flip out a little bit

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.510 
easier if it does flip out a little bit
you<00:06:38.210> get<00:06:38.360> a<00:06:38.390> little<00:06:38.690> bit<00:06:38.810> more<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.400> little<00:06:40.400> more

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
you get a little bit more a little more

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.880 
you get a little bit more a little more
clearance<00:06:40.910> so<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.420> the<00:06:41.540> bolt<00:06:41.750> goes<00:06:42.560> above

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
clearance so that the bolt goes above

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.250 
clearance so that the bolt goes above
and<00:06:43.190> into<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:43.910> hole<00:06:44.120> here<00:06:44.360> but<00:06:44.390> it<00:06:45.110> wasn't

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
and into the hole here but it wasn't

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.820 
and into the hole here but it wasn't
necessary

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
necessary

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.339 
necessary
then<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.639> took<00:06:47.849> down<00:06:48.030> these<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.810> castle<00:06:49.139> nut<00:06:49.289> I

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
then I took down these the castle nut I

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:53.029 
then I took down these the castle nut I
believe<00:06:49.620> benign<00:06:50.460> and<00:06:50.849> these<00:06:51.660> two<00:06:52.050> bulbs<00:06:52.319> here

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
believe benign and these two bulbs here

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.760 
believe benign and these two bulbs here
fifty-eight<00:06:53.669> foot-pounds<00:06:54.569> so<00:06:55.410> make<00:06:55.530> sure<00:06:55.560> you

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
fifty-eight foot-pounds so make sure you

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.980 
fifty-eight foot-pounds so make sure you
tighten<00:06:55.949> those<00:06:56.130> down<00:06:56.190> correctly<00:06:56.810> and<00:06:57.810> last

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
tighten those down correctly and last

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.040 
tighten those down correctly and last
thing<00:06:58.080> you<00:06:58.199> need<00:06:58.319> to<00:06:58.349> do<00:06:58.530> is<00:06:58.860> put<00:06:59.490> the<00:07:00.050> cotter

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
thing you need to do is put the cotter

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.529 
thing you need to do is put the cotter
pin<00:07:01.289> through<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.610> hole<00:07:03.000> and<00:07:03.240> through<00:07:03.449> the

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
pin through the hole and through the

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.620 
pin through the hole and through the
castle<00:07:03.720> nut<00:07:03.960> just<00:07:04.789> just<00:07:05.789> as<00:07:05.910> a<00:07:05.940> safety<00:07:06.240> measure

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
castle nut just just as a safety measure
