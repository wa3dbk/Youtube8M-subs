00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.329
 in this, I would like to turn 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.369
 by customer 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.369

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.109
 contextual advertising is one of 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.210
 most popular types of internet 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.339
 advertising in 2009 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.390
 not all customers represent 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.110
 what actually represents 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 contextual advertising 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.230
 and what 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 it is different from 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 standard 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.300
 very many customers 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.940
 mistaken believe that contextual advertising and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.320
 search results 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.410
 It is the same 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.290
 often use some crafty spells 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.530
 designers of his studio who 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.090

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 on contextual advertising 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.619
 How on 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.750
 site rating 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.780
 in fact 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 may hold a very low rating or 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.510
 in general it will be difficult to find in 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 search engines 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.420
 requests 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.500
 but if you give contextual advertising 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 stream links to the site may even be on 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 first positions 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.729
 contextual advertising related 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.260
 several myths 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.190
 one of them is that 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.210
 it is very cheap 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.740
 other opposite of them 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.420
 related to contextual advertising 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.440
 very expensive 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.070
 in all cases there is 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.510
 and true and 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.730
 the truth is that contextual advertising 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.570
 really 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.390
 cheaper than 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510
 traditional advertising 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.250
 but she's not worth a penny 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.780
 the cost 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.750
 clinic 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.710
 form which popular key 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 According to can be 55 dollars 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 but she should not assume that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.580
 contextual advertising is very 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.990
 expensive 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.280
 even 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.859
 the cost 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:09.979
 can make 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.979
 few dollars 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.540
 profit that can be obtained by 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.659
 deals 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.079

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.039
 more advertising costs 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.409
 if there were no contextual advertising 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.229
 profitable and not effective 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.229
 day they spent billions of dollars 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.189
 for example the search engine would not be worth 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 tens of billions 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.269
 It should be borne in mind that in addition to and 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.509
 direct costs for contextual advertising 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.439
 and me and expensive is the payment of the Internet 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.889

 costs for whom 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.190
 probability 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.229
 twist hits that is false impressions 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.229
 when visitors click 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:08.019

 contextual advertising 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.549
