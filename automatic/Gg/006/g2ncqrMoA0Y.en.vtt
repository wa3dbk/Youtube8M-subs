00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 the best of fruits and vegetables in one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 Nice glass of juice , that's what it's for you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 must be freshly pressed so that the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.460
 whole enzyme vitamins too 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.279
 find yourself in your juice and that would be 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.070
 one way the three are so lusty 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.109
 juicer and here they really have 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 a very high juice yield they have 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 namely two juice outlets there will be so 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 at the beginning of the juice out 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 pulled and then in the final phase 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.879
 so if that's just before the fruit 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 vegetables come out of the device again 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.270
 pressed again 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.879
 a very good juice quality and that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.930
 alive is a living juice and him 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.930
 You can also immediately 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 drink and profit 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.840
 Well, the solos of the three beautiful in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.640
 black which has different attachments 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.379
 I would always like to introduce that to you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.359
 so that each can not have fear 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 I serve so much at all so that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.290
 even my children can go home 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 my little kids im 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.990
 kindergarteners who can do that and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.909
 we have fun with it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.189
 once you have the engine here 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 Of course, there is one, of course 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.340
 switch to it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.899
 so not so loud or how does that look 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 maybe know from other juicers 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.850
 for example, and the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 switch also goes back if you so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 the device just overcharged 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:33.200
 then you can also do a reverse 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.490
 insert and then they have this here 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 Cover hood here is the funnel here 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 you almost feel your fruits and vegetables me 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.210
 draw the same even in the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.789
 practice and that can be taken everything 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.979
 throw them over this 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.630
 they can solve and then they have 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.890
 actually already the right one here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.789
 in the hand the fruit juice housing then 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.399
 Here's a cover then that looks 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.349
 So here this separates 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.509
 Fibers are separated here 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.369
 the juice dripping down through and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.030
 The material must be out to the front 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 pushed 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.099
 and very important a very stable one 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.630
 waltz made of a special material the 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.579
 has to endure a lot 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.099
 and here you can already see what I am doing right now 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.840
 The things have been explained in rough 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.670
 pieces are crushed on and on 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.130
 pushed forward and then they have 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 here in the middle the first juice 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.720
 exit and here again where the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.139
 Roller becomes tighter there will be again 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.299
 really nicely squeezed out so the whole 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.680
 is also relatively easy again 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.720
 assemble or still clean 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:44.579
 course and everything is nicely marked 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.920
 actually just really around so fast 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.389
 is that together again 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.060
 the funnel and then we still have 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.620
 a so-called stopper and we take 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.019
 the whole now in operation and me 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.180
 sign times how so carrots apple 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.349
 celery but also wild herbs 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.349
 can juice 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.020
 scots 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.670
 James 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.370
 yes that is also relatively fast relative 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.470
 just come out the front then that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.940
 material then you just not in the juice 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.780
 have the so-called pomace the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.330
 fibrous materials and here is the juice 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.250
 Trapped and you see already there 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.799
 a fairly large juice yield and also 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.169
 the pomace that comes out he is 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.549
 relatively dry mind so much 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.380
 got out and that's also true 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.690
 the important thing that all this 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.919
 nutrients are in the juice and not 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 here in the fore you will see them 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.410
 throw away or compost before 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.110
 you can still use it 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.780
 for example, to make bakers or 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.250
 confectionery can be found on our 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.810
 side also just more 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.530
 information what you get with the hit 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.660
 can make 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.669
 yes i hope i could give you little ones 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.990
 gain insight and I tasted 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.639
 that's just here from that one too 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.169
 Nice combination was we had now 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:59.010
 So carrot apple and these greens 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:02.760
 Dandelion and Spitzwegerich leaves one 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.889
 really enjoyable way to deal with the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.020
 to provide the best from fruits and vegetables 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.020
 yes thank you that they have watched
