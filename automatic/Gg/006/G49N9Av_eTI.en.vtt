00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.630
 let's go 2002 live the minecraft 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.340
 for yet another presentation of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 fashion and yes you will have wanted one you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 did not have much for three 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.599
 month you claimed them and ben you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.290
 you missed them complaining 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.200
 good today 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.160
 presentation of the archimedes accused mode 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.960
 the sheep 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.220
 so frankly for now I'm you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 swear it's one of the smallest modes 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.200
 make that I judged that I never 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.180
 presented never before seen on minecraft 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.390
 it's just huge so we'll get 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.160
 connect on then there is nine mode 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 I will quickly get it back but have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.850
 not nice to put my 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.450
 good graphics since I removed the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.220
 giant lift the texan shaders n 1 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:04.049
 it's a maximum yes lighting up 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 finished nikam so then first 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.470
 place so there is the the steering wheel the steering wheel 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.149
 so there is serve for the long line abc 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 a hot air balloon this word must allow 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.990
 to create a boat a hot air balloon that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.929
 you will control as like a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 common chauveau as attac is what 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.729
 as it should be and all that so they get 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.670
 kraft like this with boards 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.350
 anything from the boards of the sticks 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 in the corners and an ingot to make 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.049
 the better it gives you the steering wheel like 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.700
 this then we have the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 that's for the boat so it's a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.389
 the two command boards we will say 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.909
 of the boat so this kraft with two windows 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.350
 not independent not seen ice 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639
 castration failures like that here finally 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.990
 what 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.159
 then two ingots to make as if 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.719
 of nothing to do like those of 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.420
 gold bars like that a bullion throne 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.649
 in the middle and so that gives you this 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.439
 it's for the hot air balloon 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 will give after the floats it serves 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.619
 strictly nothing in fact there are some 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.299
 blocks of which there are nine kraft but there are 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.069
 has three or four who are really 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.420
 useful to create the 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.529
 others I do not know at all what they 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 serve they are totally useless 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:10.140
 so it's useless for the kraft and so 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.950
 that's it, these herbs alone are going to be 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.170
 to build men 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.100
 so we see from below who has three 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.440
 little gauges there it is for the boat 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.380
 he who has four big is so 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.420
 the hot air balloon it was said that the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.090
 floats it was useless the herbs 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.250
 halloween that's it that's the seats 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.050
 so we'll say it stinks he 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 just missing no echo salty wooden 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.610
 kreuzer strictly for nothing the stephen 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.140
 jones released cmo nothing and shorts do 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.540
 it would be that it serves absolutely nothing 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 and low in the topic that said no 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.020
 how kraft foods and had a 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.310
 block and a cold string but this block 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.850
 down he was unknown to the battalion 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.530
 so in short this is actually going fast 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.060
 did go here to see here I had done a 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.490
 mini test so we'll take some 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.830
 boards we will break a little bit everything 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.850
 that's sure to have room 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.620
 it's just to show you how that 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.700
 walk and then after I go you 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.160
 show what I did here you go 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.710
 so it's very simple you build 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.960
 your boat not with the steering wheel but 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.970
 with blocks 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.620
 So here we will do a little trick the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.360
 the the the the binds to the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.740
 gnagna there I will not make you 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.980
 descamps i just show you how 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.940
 it works 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.680
 so here you are doing the size that 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.890
 you want to put yourself a little 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.530
 armchair for the kiff kiff you put 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.130
 a side plancha the steering wheel you put 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.050
 your little one your little gauge ob you 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.000
 click on it you put him his little 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.840
 name of cities duc duck wet 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.910
 that's how we can put a big 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.190
 name then we click on his team 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.430
 to be able to the assembly so there he me 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.570
 says chip with more dan totten so 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.610
 apparently I put too many blocks so 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.920
 for this figure so we will destroy 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.970
 so as in fact it is this is the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.730
 big axis to do it to me but hey it's 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.150
 not so we're going to re click it to his 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.000
 cheap 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.800
 ok so here he says it's good so 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.990
 this is to undo it so we redid 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.320
 and here we chip and there it is 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.580
 created by boat so the whole blog can be 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.560
 not break it can not add anything 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.540
 on it was created by boat so 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.430
 it's a boat that also walks on the 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.440
 head 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.090
 so it's completely buggy there but 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.830
 orders it's all simple these 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.670
 helps to advance French 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.540
 z escudÃ© what is the left digit 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.770
 to disassemble it finally to get that out 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.180
 it's done so I 'll show you 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.320
 then we can make a bigger 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.120
 I do not know why it did not 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.650
 market because look 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.860
 I made a boat that is still 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.060
 pretty big enough hop 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 jamie of actually early I did not know 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.900
 so I put both the two gear 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.680
 but in the end his sister absolutely nothing 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.930
 promise that one 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.200
 so it only has to be put on to 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.960
 click and go for the adventurous 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.910
 again if he sees there it is mother nature 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.130
 I 'm not his father fart like that no 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.810
 so it is indestructible it's cool 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.910
 but you can make yourself a liner 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.470
 do you titanic do you what 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.960
 you want and that frankly I find 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.310
 that it's just too classy what and in 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.810
 the more he passed quickly as we can see 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.540
 and they do not break like the others 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.620
 boats so this being done there you 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.090
 will miss more than you do a little 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.700
 port i will show you quickly the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.870
 hot air balloon how it works 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.840
 well, we'll say we're going up on a tree 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.300
 he goes out to have it up already up 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.300
 so we get our little platform 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.120
 this is up so this time strong valves 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:45.960
 bars and barriers to assemble 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.760
 to assemble the balloon tunes there 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.080
 so I advise you to do 3 and to 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.700
 two or three floors that will depend on 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.830
 the corpulence somehow of your 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.810
 hot air balloon but I advise you to 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.310
 do two or three floors a floor 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.830
 it's not enough that it will not happen 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.340
 bear it finally what I heard 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.930
 so here we will try with two hop hop 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.640
 hop hop hop here's that that's it 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.110
 do you put your seat for the kif 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.540
 kif 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.000
 so here we are going to put 2 next 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.540
 you put yourself flying finally your 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.210
 flying at least with this time so 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.520
 the one you click on like 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.700
 Usually you are their elders but in 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.689
 cities that the little mustard duck who 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:39.749
 stinks of mister 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:45.479
 kraft code that just sent me e vo 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:47.189
 and an urgent message to the cays aps 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.139
 here with a little smiley you do 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.619
 assemble the cheap ok you put my 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.719
 team 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.639
 and that's it, it's gone 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.589
 sesay orders of escudÃ© to advance 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.509
 back away from that after it's up to you to 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.069
 choose but I ended when you 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.039
 install mode it will put you z 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.749
 for to go down and x to go up and 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.979
 so you will not be able to walk with 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:07.079
 your character normally so I 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.369
 should go in the options the 

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.259
 controls have changed here so some 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.969
 holy this will be basic help but you 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.489
 put w faculty to everything you 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.439
 want and so see you go down 

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:19.969
 you go up and you can walk 

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.839
 tragedy tralala in the air the same for 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:25.409
 disassemble the you have a small parachute 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:28.769
 his cell kif to finally disassemble for 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:31.289
 get off his wings shift so here's 

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:33.749
 then I write a little more 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:36.329
 big with 3 of height ob you can 

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:38.610
 get in you climb you say you 

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:40.289
 go up with x and go for 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.649
 the adventurous so frankly this mode 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:46.169
 just extra too lol lol frankly I 

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:47.999
 the fuck too much because that's it 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:49.559
 frankly it's just huge could 

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:49.860
 control or thing the boat is going great 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:52.800
 quick 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.939
 that's more for the lol I think 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.999
 it would be better to put windows in 

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:58.709
 down bridge to see everything but hey 

00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:00.509
 is actually the little parachute that we 

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:02.099
 save the life me thank you 

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.339
 to have watched this presentation of 

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.929
 fashion 

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:05.519
 I hope you liked it because 

00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:07.289
 show that I like it a lot and
