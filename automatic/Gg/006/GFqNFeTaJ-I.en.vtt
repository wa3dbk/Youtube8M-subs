00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 chris is who inaugurates this final series 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.309
 3 among Slovenian still junior always in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.110
 area points in this initial phase of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 season very early the choices from the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 tooth and pay him this advance oh my God 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.600
 here, however, the attack fell off 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.189
 ruinous of laniece has lost a ski has 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.100
 lost a ski in flight came off 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.420
 the impressive attack 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 here is a fall that can have 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.630
 also bad consequences in the head 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.630
 of the athlete but how it is possible 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.130
 we see replay 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.310
 the attack comes off 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.500
 I don't know if it's structural damage or 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.270
 if it is another problem but me 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.180
 I don't remember an incident of this kind 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.430
 especially in that flight phase ie 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.059
 in the final and the fall was 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.540
 obviously we can ruin it for myself 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.309
 end up here though today because when 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.559
 events of this kind begin to come 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.160
 means that there is something not 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.380
 it works in the area this has been 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.640
 really an abnormal fall they have way 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.680
 to see worse than that of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 wellinger because the athlete was 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.509
 completely projected forward into 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.039
 attempt to gain meters and when 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.020
 you are projected forward you lose of 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.880
 made your support then knows 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.680
 all the aerodynamic speakers jump 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 with everything that can be achieved 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.729
 but what the bad luck of the two younger athletes 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.479
 in the race victims of falls in this case 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.479
 also anomalous 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.640
 here sincerely there are no faults for 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.710
 competition organizers and directors or 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.340
 whatever else they are facts that they don't 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.750
 they should happen because that attack 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 it is structured in such a way that it can 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.060
 withstand any kind of stress 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.320
 even the hardest ones because otherwise 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.300
 this discipline would no longer make sense 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.990
 for obvious reasons it is not that you can play 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.910
 to Russian and jump from a springboard 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.940
 significant size at 100 kilometers 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 timetables 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.010
 what a pity because laniece and who was 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.540
 doing really well today would be 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.959
 arrived at the third race for two in the area 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.610
 points 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.170
 this jump hadn't been either 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.540
 exceptional from a technical point of view 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.670
 not perfect on posting times though 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.140
 these are all secondary aspects not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.610
 you can detach an attack in flight 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.700
 look at what a beautiful position in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.700
 flight with skis to dacca 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:43.690
 aerodynamically equipped this guy 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 fell to 90 per hour but dynamics that 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.660
 frankly I struggle to remember I am already 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 missed attacks but maybe it happened 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.980
 in the first thirty meters of flight 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.140
 also the nis and which raises an arm to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.600
 healthy public 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.410
 we hope to see both he and andreas 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.790
 leander next week wellinger 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.790
 even if very simple
