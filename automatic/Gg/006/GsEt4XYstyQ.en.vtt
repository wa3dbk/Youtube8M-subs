00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.149 
this is what you should have it's really
stiff<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:02.119> very<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.630> combined<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.619> didn't

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
stiff it's very well combined it didn't

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
stiff it's very well combined it didn't
actually<00:02:05.430> stop<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.149> thermo<00:02:06.450> chef<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
actually stop the thermo chef but it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.160 
actually stop the thermo chef but it
started<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.910> labour<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.179> bit<00:02:09.360> much<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.929> I've

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
started to labour a bit much so I've

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.020 
started to labour a bit much so I've
turned<00:02:10.440> off

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
turned off

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.780 
turned off
so<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.660> has<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.890> fail-safe<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.700> will

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
so it has a fail-safe in it that will

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.060 
so it has a fail-safe in it that will
stop<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.300> from<00:02:14.330> overloading<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.500> motor<00:02:15.710> and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
stop it from overloading the motor and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.940 
stop it from overloading the motor and
that<00:02:16.490> didn't<00:02:16.760> cut<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:18.290> much<00:02:18.620> stiffer

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that didn't cut in so it's much stiffer

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.230 
that didn't cut in so it's much stiffer
than<00:02:19.190> what<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.610> would<00:02:19.700> find<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.210> normal

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
than what you would find in a normal

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.600 
than what you would find in a normal
