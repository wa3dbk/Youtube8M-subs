accuracy I was a little bit torn between
this<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.400> AR<00:02:23.550> because<00:02:24.150> obviously<00:02:24.420> 556

ammo<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:25.890> plentiful<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> thing<00:02:27.209> about

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
ammo is so plentiful but the thing about

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.590 
ammo is so plentiful but the thing about
the<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.080> 556<00:02:28.890> round<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.940> made<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> maim

Apocalypse scenario you want 7.62 power
you<00:02:45.720> don't<00:02:45.870> want<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.739> shooting

you don't want to have to be shooting
someone<00:02:47.820> more<00:02:47.970> than<00:02:48.030> once<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.630> let<00:02:49.230> me<00:02:49.290> show

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
someone more than once so let me show

someone more than once so let me show
you<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.830> thing<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.370> okay<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.360> we've

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
you what this thing can do okay so we've

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.300 
you what this thing can do okay so we've
got<00:02:51.660> our<00:02:51.840> invader<00:02:52.380> down<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.890> hiding<00:02:53.130> behind

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
got our invader down there hiding behind

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
got our invader down there hiding behind
some<00:02:53.670> cement<00:02:53.940> blocks<00:02:54.269> going<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.170> take<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.470> a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
some cement blocks going to take this a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 
some cement blocks going to take this a
cave<00:02:55.890> with<00:02:56.070> 7.62<00:02:56.880> around<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.360> show<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> why<00:02:57.780> I

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
cave with 7.62 around and show you why I

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.140 
cave with 7.62 around and show you why I
like<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.140> 7.62<00:02:59.070> round<00:02:59.340> going<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.940> choose

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
like the 7.62 round going to choose

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:15.940 
like the 7.62 round going to choose
straight<00:03:00.390> through<00:03:00.570> those<00:03:00.720> blocks

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.800 

so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.189> see<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:18.060> you're<00:03:18.209> firing<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.659> big

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
so you can see if you're firing a big

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
so you can see if you're firing a big
enough<00:03:18.989> round<00:03:19.319> doesn't<00:03:20.189> matter<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
enough round doesn't matter what you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.970 
enough round doesn't matter what you
hide<00:03:20.939> behind<00:03:21.019> okay<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.079> now<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.769> really

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
hide behind okay so now you can really

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.009 
hide behind okay so now you can really
see<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:23.489> kind<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.760> damage<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.299> did<00:03:24.450> keep<00:03:24.900> in

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
see what kind of damage we did keep in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.599 
see what kind of damage we did keep in
mind<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.379> is<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.530> same<00:03:25.799> sort<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.189> block<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
mind this is the same sort of block that

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.910 
mind this is the same sort of block that
they<00:03:26.730> build<00:03:27.000> houses<00:03:27.590> buildings<00:03:28.590> where<00:03:28.769> this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
they build houses buildings where this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.640 
they build houses buildings where this
stuff<00:03:29.159> is<00:03:29.310> everywhere<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:31.200> absolutely

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
stuff is everywhere and the absolutely

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.009 
stuff is everywhere and the absolutely
ripped<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.129> apart<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.180> back<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.629> can<00:03:33.689> see

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
ripped it apart on the back you can see

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.569 
ripped it apart on the back you can see
it's<00:03:34.170> completely<00:03:34.349> blown<00:03:35.129> out<00:03:35.340> because

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
it's completely blown out because

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.280 
it's completely blown out because
there's<00:03:35.790> always<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.390> exit<00:03:36.989> hole<00:03:37.109> is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
there's always the the exit hole is

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.930 
there's always the the exit hole is
bigger<00:03:37.500> than<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.709> entrance<00:03:38.069> hole<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.459> our

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
bigger than the entrance hole and our

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.229 
bigger than the entrance hole and our
friend<00:03:39.269> here<00:03:39.450> had<00:03:39.659> a<00:03:39.690> very<00:03:40.139> very<00:03:40.829> bad<00:03:41.099> day<00:03:41.239> so

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
friend here had a very very bad day so

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.449
