00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.710
 today we are going to do a vain fi home 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.710
 These are the ingredients 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 unsalted butter a sweet pot of 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:18.820
 milk two bananas 15 digestive cookies 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.619
 150 grams of icing sugar and 500 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 milliliters of cream to assemble 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.750
 The first thing to do is explain 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.849
 the cookies for this we can use 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.450
 a mortar as you see in the video or 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.450
 in a blender 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.170
 once we have them well chopped the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.170
 we put in a bowl 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 Now we go with the butter without salt 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 let's cut a piece 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.870
 approximately 100 grams if then 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 we need more we can do again 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 the same operation and we're going to put it in 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 the microwave to melt 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 once it has melted as you see in 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
 the video will be added to the cookie 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 chopped and we will make the mixture yes while 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.949
 we are making the mix we see that no 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.420
 it is enough we repeat again the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.420
 operation with more butter 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.750
 once we have made the mix well 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 We can put everything in the final mold 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
 of the cake with the help of a spoon 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.370
 we will crush the cookie well to 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.280
 that there is a firm base how many more 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.680
 fatter cookies will be the base once 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.660
 we have the base made we go to chop 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 making slices the two bananas 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.300
 once chopped, it's just to put them 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.300
 at the base of the cake 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 now we take the milk candy jar 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.940
 and we heat it a bit in the microwave 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.060
 to make it easier to spread 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.070
 once heated with a spoon the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.040
 we spread all over the surface of the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.420
 We have left the cake like this but 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.710
 if you like it with more dulce de leche 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.710
 simply add more 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 now we take the 500 milliliters of cream 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.430
 liquid to assemble and put them in a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 bowl 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.849
 before putting the icing sugar we are going to 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.819
 whipping cream slightly for 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.190
 assemble for it we will use a blender or 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.320
 some rods like these 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.630
 once we have beaten it a little we can 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.990
 add the 150 grams of icing sugar 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.710
 to continue beating until it has 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.710
 mounted the cream 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.480
 after a few minutes beating the cream this 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.480
 it is the final result 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.790
 so now we should put it on 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.850
 of the base with the bananas without sweet of 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.230
 milk the amount you should put is 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.300
 a little to taste we have 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 put a layer not very high because to me 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.170
 I do not like cream very much but if you 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 like the cream because you can put more and 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.430
 so you will have a higher cake 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.110
 once the cream is spread, that's how 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.110
 it is more or less 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.880
 optionally we can decorate it by scratching 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.830
 chocolate chips on top like 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.500
 if it was cheese but using chocolate 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.430
 normal and current to be like this 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.430
 as you see in the video 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.350
 once the decoration is finished it is 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.420
 ready to put in the refrigerator and 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.490
 wait a few hours to be able to consume 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.300
 this is the final aspect of this cake 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.490
 banana 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.860
