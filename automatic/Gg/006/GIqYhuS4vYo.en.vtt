00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.330 
conditioner it's not supposed to be a
leave-in<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> use<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> leave-in

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
leave-in but I use it as a leave-in

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
leave-in but I use it as a leave-in
because<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> looked<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> few<00:00:23.820> reviews<00:00:24.510> on

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because I looked up a few reviews on

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
because I looked up a few reviews on
YouTube<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.529> also<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.310> pretty<00:00:26.550> nice

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
YouTube and they also it was pretty nice

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
YouTube and they also it was pretty nice
to<00:00:26.849> believe<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> decided<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.019> give<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
to believe and so I decided to give it a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.089 
to believe and so I decided to give it a
try<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.199> hard<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> explain<00:00:31.949> how

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
try and it's really hard to explain how

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
try and it's really hard to explain how
to<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> flat<00:00:32.969> twist<00:00:33.290> you're<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.649> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to do a flat twist you're just it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
to do a flat twist you're just it's
almost<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> braid<00:00:36.180> except<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.870> only<00:00:36.899> use

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
almost like a braid except you only use

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.680 
almost like a braid except you only use
two<00:00:37.500> pieces<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> start<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
two pieces to start with and you just

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
two pieces to start with and you just
twist<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.200> each<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.770> mean<00:00:41.040> it's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
twist them around each other I mean it's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.830 
twist them around each other I mean it's
not<00:00:42.059> hard<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.710> hard<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> explain<00:00:44.539> but<00:00:45.539> I'm

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
not hard to do hard to explain but I'm

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
not hard to do hard to explain but I'm
gonna<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.170> wrapping<00:00:46.379> them<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.640> end<00:00:47.850> around

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the flat part in total I think I had

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.800 
the flat part in total I think I had
maybe<00:01:03.300> six<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.170> seven<00:01:04.650> flat<00:01:04.920> twists<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.810> just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
maybe six or seven flat twists and just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
maybe six or seven flat twists and just
a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.500> hint<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.159> doing<00:01:08.580> Blatz<00:01:08.820> whit's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
a little hint about doing Blatz whit's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
a little hint about doing Blatz whit's
if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.170> small<00:01:10.530> twists<00:01:10.920> eat<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
if you do small twists eat well to be

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
if you do small twists eat well to be
more<00:01:12.180> defined<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> bigger<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
more defined and then the bigger the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.520 
more defined and then the bigger the
Swiss<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> make<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.780> looser<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.500> curl

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
Swiss that you make the looser the curl

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
Swiss that you make the looser the curl
will<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:17.040> after<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.670> done<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.270> keep<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
will be after it's done so keep that in

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.359 
will be after it's done so keep that in
mind<00:01:19.140> while<00:01:19.560> doing<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> tend<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
mind while doing this I tend to do the

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.490 
mind while doing this I tend to do the
front<00:01:23.369> parts<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.600> smaller<00:01:25.140> than<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
front parts a little smaller than the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.149 
front parts a little smaller than the
rest<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:27.590> because<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
rest of them because I just think it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.640 
rest of them because I just think it
looks<00:01:29.189> better<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.549> way

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.590 

and<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.130> completely<00:01:35.909> even<00:01:36.300> tell<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and you can completely even tell the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
and you can completely even tell the
tale<00:01:36.810> through<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.409> spaces<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.860> miss<00:01:38.040> when

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
tale through all the spaces I miss when

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
tale through all the spaces I miss when
I<00:01:38.280> bleach<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.490> hair<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.479> planning<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I bleach my hair and I'm planning on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.940 
I bleach my hair and I'm planning on
fixing<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.350> soon<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.659> big<00:01:42.659> deal

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.370 

and<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.159> me<00:01:47.340> doing<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> again<00:01:48.380> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and it's just me doing that again and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
and it's just me doing that again and
this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> last<00:01:50.430> twist<00:01:50.820> I'll<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.180> showing

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this is the last twist I'll be showing

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.030 
this is the last twist I'll be showing
you<00:01:51.540> before<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.710> start<00:01:54.860> taking<00:01:55.860> them

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you before I actually start taking them

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040 
you before I actually start taking them
down<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.550> said<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.390> smaller<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> twist

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
down like I said the smaller the twist

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.570 
down like I said the smaller the twist
you<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.470> well<00:02:01.650> as<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> curls<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
you make as well as the curls if you

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.480 
you make as well as the curls if you
