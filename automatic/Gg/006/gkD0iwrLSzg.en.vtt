but<00:00:13.750> today<00:00:14.410> what<00:00:14.559> we're<00:00:14.680> going<00:00:14.769> to<00:00:14.860> be<00:00:14.889> talking

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
but today what we're going to be talking

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.980 
but today what we're going to be talking
about<00:00:15.309> is<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.760> difference<00:00:16.119> between<00:00:16.240> eating

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
about is the difference between eating

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.220 
about is the difference between eating
in<00:00:17.110> six<00:00:17.350> meals<00:00:17.590> a<00:00:17.770> day<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.160> three<00:00:18.580> meals<00:00:18.790> a<00:00:18.939> day

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
in six meals a day and three meals a day

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.960 
in six meals a day and three meals a day
so<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.590> traditional<00:00:21.130> way<00:00:21.250> of<00:00:21.279> eating<00:00:21.550> is<00:00:21.820> to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
so the traditional way of eating is to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.519 
so the traditional way of eating is to
have<00:00:22.119> your<00:00:22.240> standard<00:00:22.599> breakfast<00:00:23.140> lunch<00:00:23.349> and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
have your standard breakfast lunch and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.589 
have your standard breakfast lunch and
dinner<00:00:23.610> but<00:00:24.610> now<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:24.790> thought<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.330> in<00:00:25.480> order

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
dinner but now we thought that in order

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.839 
dinner but now we thought that in order
to<00:00:25.869> burn<00:00:25.990> fat<00:00:26.290> more<00:00:26.320> efficiently<00:00:26.640> we've<00:00:27.640> got

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
to burn fat more efficiently we've got

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.569 
to burn fat more efficiently we've got
to<00:00:27.970> take<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.419> standard<00:00:28.810> three<00:00:28.990> meals<00:00:29.169> a<00:00:29.320> day

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
to take the standard three meals a day

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.000 
to take the standard three meals a day
cut<00:00:30.579> them<00:00:30.759> in<00:00:30.880> half<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.450> eat<00:00:32.169> six<00:00:32.649> smaller

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
cut them in half and eat six smaller

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.990 
cut them in half and eat six smaller
portions<00:00:33.750> why<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.860> we<00:00:36.130> assume<00:00:36.520> that<00:00:36.880> the

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
portions why because we assume that the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.479 
portions why because we assume that the
more<00:00:37.270> meals<00:00:37.630> we<00:00:37.899> eat<00:00:38.190> assume<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.340> course

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
more meals we eat assume you of course

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.100 
more meals we eat assume you of course
the<00:00:39.640> intake<00:00:39.940> calorie<00:00:40.420> intake<00:00:40.510> is<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.870> same

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
the intake calorie intake is the same

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.470 
the intake calorie intake is the same
the<00:00:41.680> more<00:00:41.920> meals<00:00:42.190> were<00:00:42.370> eat<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:43.149> more

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
the more meals were eat the more

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.389 
the more meals were eat the more
calories<00:00:43.840> are<00:00:44.320> what<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:44.620> needs<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.829> burn<00:00:45.100> to

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
calories are what it needs to burn to

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.090 
calories are what it needs to burn to
digest<00:00:45.820> multiple<00:00:46.329> meals<00:00:46.739> therefore<00:00:47.739> we

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
digest multiple meals therefore we

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.180 
digest multiple meals therefore we
assumes<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:49.000> eating<00:00:49.629> multiple<00:00:50.469> small<00:00:50.890> meals

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
assumes that eating multiple small meals

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
assumes that eating multiple small meals
a<00:00:51.339> day<00:00:51.480> increases<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.780> thermogenic<00:00:53.379> effect

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a day increases the thermogenic effect

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.160 
a day increases the thermogenic effect
meaning<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.149> amount<00:00:55.329> of<00:00:55.449> calories<00:00:55.870> our<00:00:56.019> body

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
meaning the amount of calories our body

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.209 
meaning the amount of calories our body
burns<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.829> digest<00:00:57.309> those<00:00:57.460> meals<00:00:57.789> now<00:00:58.449> doubles

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
burns to digest those meals now doubles

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.380 
burns to digest those meals now doubles
what<00:01:00.219> we've<00:01:00.370> learned<00:01:00.460> recently<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.120> is

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
what we've learned recently is that is

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.450 
what we've learned recently is that is
not<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.659> case<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.890> we've<00:01:03.039> learned<00:01:03.070> recently

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
not the case what we've learned recently

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.369 
not the case what we've learned recently
is<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.969> your<00:01:04.390> body's<00:01:04.659> thermogenic<00:01:05.170> effect

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
is that your body's thermogenic effect

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.320 
is that your body's thermogenic effect
is<00:01:05.800> directly<00:01:06.280> related<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.760> your<00:01:07.000> calorie

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
is directly related to your calorie

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.950 
is directly related to your calorie
intake<00:01:07.980> so<00:01:08.980> whether<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.580> eat<00:01:09.790> five<00:01:10.510> or<00:01:10.720> six

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
intake so whether you eat five or six

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.810 
intake so whether you eat five or six
small<00:01:11.260> meals<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.620> day<00:01:11.650> first<00:01:12.159> three<00:01:12.430> meals<00:01:12.640> a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
small meals a day first three meals a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.960 
small meals a day first three meals a
day<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:14.080> thermogenic<00:01:14.890> effect<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.370> your<00:01:15.610> body

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
day your thermogenic effect in your body

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.390 
day your thermogenic effect in your body
is<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.300> ability<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.900> digest<00:01:17.650> those<00:01:18.070> meals

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
is the ability to digest those meals

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.590 
is the ability to digest those meals
adapts<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.590> if<00:01:21.070> you're<00:01:21.310> eating<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.360> same

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
adapts so if you're eating the same

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.840 
adapts so if you're eating the same
amount<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:23.020> calories<00:01:23.190> your<00:01:24.190> body<00:01:24.220> will<00:01:24.640> burn

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
amount of calories your body will burn

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.270 
amount of calories your body will burn
the<00:01:25.660> same<00:01:25.900> amount<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.320> calories<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.890> digest

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
the same amount of calories to digest

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.940 
the same amount of calories to digest
those<00:01:27.460> meals<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.900> what<00:01:29.260> I've<00:01:29.380> done<00:01:29.410> is<00:01:29.560> I've

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
those meals so what I've done is I've

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.040 
those meals so what I've done is I've
switched<00:01:30.280> back<00:01:30.700> from<00:01:30.970> having<00:01:31.180> my<00:01:31.570> standard

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
switched back from having my standard

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.160 
switched back from having my standard
five<00:01:32.410> mils<00:01:32.710> six<00:01:33.310> meals<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.700> day<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:34.570> eating

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
five mils six meals a day to eating

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.890 
five mils six meals a day to eating
three<00:01:35.530> meals<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.860> day<00:01:35.890> my<00:01:36.880> calorie<00:01:37.330> intake<00:01:37.510> is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
three meals a day my calorie intake is

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.930 
three meals a day my calorie intake is
the<00:01:38.020> same<00:01:38.230> my<00:01:38.530> macronutrient<00:01:39.370> intake<00:01:39.430> is<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
the same my macronutrient intake is the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.910 
the same my macronutrient intake is the
same<00:01:40.150> and<00:01:40.360> therefore<00:01:40.600> my<00:01:41.050> body's<00:01:41.350> ability<00:01:41.650> to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
same and therefore my body's ability to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.370 
same and therefore my body's ability to
increase<00:01:42.640> muscle<00:01:42.940> mass<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.480> decrease<00:01:44.170> body

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
increase muscle mass and decrease body

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.470 
increase muscle mass and decrease body
fat<00:01:44.530> has<00:01:45.310> remained<00:01:45.820> exactly<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.720> same

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.020 

now<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.540> introduce<00:01:52.840> something<00:01:53.230> new<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.610> a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
now to introduce something new and a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.810 
now to introduce something new and a
little<00:01:55.300> bit<00:01:55.420> well<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.050> was<00:01:56.370> skeptical<00:01:57.370> for

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
little bit well it was skeptical for

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.300 
little bit well it was skeptical for
many<00:01:58.000> months<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.630> many<00:01:58.750> years<00:01:59.140> but<00:01:59.470> now<00:01:59.530> it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
many months and many years but now it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.900 
many months and many years but now it
has<00:02:00.550> become<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:01.330> part<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:03.190> body<00:02:03.460> building

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
has become a part of the body building

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.190 
has become a part of the body building
and<00:02:04.120> fat<00:02:04.750> loss<00:02:04.810> industry<00:02:05.440> is<00:02:06.690> fasting<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.870> what

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
and fat loss industry is fasting I what

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.260 
and fat loss industry is fasting I what
we<00:02:08.290> call<00:02:08.440> intermittent<00:02:09.100> fasting<00:02:09.220> now<00:02:10.090> what

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
we call intermittent fasting now what

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.400 
we call intermittent fasting now what
this<00:02:10.390> simply<00:02:10.780> means<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:13.020> don't<00:02:14.020> eat

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
this simply means is that you don't eat

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.540 
this simply means is that you don't eat
and<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.160> simply<00:02:15.340> fast<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.750> either<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.830> 24<00:02:18.430> hour

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and you simply fast for either a 24 hour

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
and you simply fast for either a 24 hour
