00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.649
 jams take the fruits money 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.649
 this is the proboise weighed of the fruits 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:23.070
 then we have about 200 grams to add 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.869
 100 men of special sugar accounts 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.789
 jam you can put sugar 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 normal but I advise you to put 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.980
 of the suspect his jam because there is 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980
 already in lyon 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.469
 that's okay so normally it's 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 a little bit more but normally it's 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 almost half 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.370
 200 g of fruit from sugar plants 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 but I like it I looked to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.030
 a little bit more and you're either a little 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.660
 a little lighter we put sugar with 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 raspberries and live the fire over a fire 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.690
 sweet during that time the taxes or 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.699
 many in this case but he 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.780
 need a single well 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 turn on your fake to sterilize this 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 this pure then you yourself can you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.840
 put at 200 that's enough like that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.170
 the pot will be sterilized and and your 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 jams will keep well once in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.509
 boil let kill minimum rest 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040
 ten minutes but you will see there is a 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 little trick that know if jam 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 and cooked 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.670
 meanwhile take one be a small 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.450
 and me like that or so a month study 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 in this in that style then and then sniffs and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 take out the tum here's remove all 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.180
 the teams you find so 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.090
 that they stay that which is good 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.070
 this is wise in front of pia more tum 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.310
 not there it keeps running just a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.630
 small a little thing 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 sugar the quantity often depends on 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 fruits 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.909
 there are fruits that transforms more 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.489
 water than others and good shot bin 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.870
 you have to add a little bit of a little 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.000
 little more for a little less 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.560
 or a little more cooking 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 but all this once you have 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 understood the technique after that you 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.470
 adapt at the level of the thigh so have 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.040
 the little trick to know if they 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.630
 are cooked 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.640
 you take a little jam 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.780
 in a teaspoon in a 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.850
 spoon you put her long plate 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.890
 and you look at whether your jam is cool 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.330
 there in this case flows almost no 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.250
 journey the plate is is almost 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 almost not so it means that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.540
 your jam and is almost following 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.569
 so once the jam is like 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 that you take out the bridge which is still 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.700
 in oven so take the step at 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.030
 level of play was saying you take your 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.700
 jam and you pour your jam 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.450
 directly taxing by doing kids 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.040
 to put aside 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.480
 good there it's not easy because I have 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.880
 the camera with me and one last thing 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.579
 we release the cover quickly and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.840
 although the hot spot and that 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.150
 normally this is sterilized for 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.690
 finish the series gas sterilization 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.760
 we put the pot upside down so 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.270
 heat of jam will come tighten 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.970
 and remove the air that underneath and 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.800
 and that ends the sterilization of this 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.830
 way it 's all night two 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.650
 sets like this and after you can them 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.560
 store in the plata and your jams 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.940
 are nickels then you can do that 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.610
 with all the jams you want 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.070
 the the principle will be the same for all 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.760
 jams here soon for 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.740
 new videos 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.410
 in this case the ace and for the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.410
 raspberry jam thank you see you soon
