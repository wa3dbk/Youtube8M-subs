one thing I will point out to our
families<00:01:52.080> very<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:52.560> useful<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:53.070> lampa<00:01:53.430> fires

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
families very very useful on lampa fires

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.500 
families very very useful on lampa fires
it<00:01:53.820> has<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.390> bass<00:01:55.350> boost<00:01:55.770> ring<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.180> can

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
it has a a bass boost ring that you can

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.600 
it has a a bass boost ring that you can
remove<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.260> give<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.860> bit<00:01:59.010> higher<00:01:59.340> bass

response<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> microphone<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.869> removed<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
response to the microphone I removed it

so<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.010> its<00:02:05.220> uses<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> may<00:02:06.060> well<00:02:06.210> find

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
so for all its uses so you may well find

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
so for all its uses so you may well find
more<00:02:06.630> removing<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.049> ringing<00:02:07.290> may<00:02:07.530> all

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
more removing that ringing may all

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.100 
more removing that ringing may all
improve<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.399> well<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.989> now<00:02:09.989> they

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
improve it for you as well and now they

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
improve it for you as well and now they
are<00:02:10.140> essentially<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> normal<00:02:11.340> microphone<00:02:11.700> but

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
are essentially a normal microphone but

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.770 
are essentially a normal microphone but
they<00:02:11.939> have<00:02:12.150> inbuilt<00:02:12.659> some

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
they have inbuilt some

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
they have inbuilt some
signal<00:02:14.170> processing<00:02:14.590> having<00:02:15.490> built

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
signal processing having built

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
signal processing having built
compressor<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.540> think<00:02:16.750> they<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> maybe

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
compressor I think they have a maybe

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.430 
compressor I think they have a maybe
limiter<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.600> noise<00:02:19.600> gate<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.140> things<00:02:20.319> like

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
limiter and noise gate and things like

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.770 
limiter and noise gate and things like
that<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.890> improves<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.910> performance<00:02:21.940> of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
that that improves the performance of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270 
that that improves the performance of
the<00:02:22.870> modern<00:02:23.170> specifically<00:02:23.740> our<00:02:23.860> guess<00:02:24.069> for

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
the modern specifically our guess for

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.850 
the modern specifically our guess for
live<00:02:24.640> performance<00:02:25.240> if<00:02:26.080> you're<00:02:26.319> using<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.800> in

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
live performance if you're using it in

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.230 
live performance if you're using it in
the<00:02:26.920> studio<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.310> guess<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.730> probably<00:02:27.819> had<00:02:28.060> that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
the studio I guess you probably had that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.850 
the studio I guess you probably had that
to<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> health<00:02:28.690> board<00:02:28.870> gear<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:29.770> you're

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
to the health board gear but if you're

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.410 
to the health board gear but if you're
using<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.220> live<00:02:30.459> youth<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> plug<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.270> my

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
using it live youth on a plug of my

using it live youth on a plug of my
defense<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.930> desk<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.950> whatever<00:02:33.220> purpose

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
defense the desk for whatever purpose

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.460 
defense the desk for whatever purpose
you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.880> use<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.450> live<00:02:35.050> where<00:02:35.290> for

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you can use for for live where for

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
speeches or whatever that would be quite

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.040 
speeches or whatever that would be quite
handy<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> processing<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
handy to have all the processing in so

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.240 
handy to have all the processing in so
on<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.230> marking<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.620> we<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.860> plug<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.130> in<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
on the marking so we just plug it in a

great I recently used it for marking up
my<00:02:51.010> vox<00:02:51.370> amp<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.150> sounded<00:02:52.480> fantastic<00:02:52.600> for

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
my vox amp and it sounded fantastic for

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.990 
my vox amp and it sounded fantastic for
that<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.650> moved<00:02:54.040> out<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.340> sound<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.760> Vox

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
that it's moved out the sound of the Vox

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.680 
that it's moved out the sound of the Vox
which<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.330> quite<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.739> top<00:02:56.739> e<00:02:56.769> amp<00:02:57.010> anyway<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.480> it

another good time and we'll try out you

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.020 
another good time and we'll try out you
vocal<00:03:05.769> against<00:03:06.100> he'll<00:03:06.489> be<00:03:06.610> interesting<00:03:06.970> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
vocal against he'll be interesting to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.670 
vocal against he'll be interesting to
see<00:03:07.150> how<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.420> compares<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.870> my<00:03:07.989> my<00:03:08.530> old

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
see how it compares to my my old

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.520 
see how it compares to my my old
favorite<00:03:08.920> be<00:03:09.250> 258<00:03:09.790> I've<00:03:10.750> used<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.350> said

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
favorite be 258 I've used it like I said

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.890 
favorite be 258 I've used it like I said
many<00:03:11.769> many<00:03:11.920> years<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.610> my<00:03:12.730> old<00:03:12.900> faithful

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
many many years and it's my old faithful

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.229 
many many years and it's my old faithful
faithful<00:03:14.080> friend<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.860> moving<00:03:15.819> away<00:03:15.880> from<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
faithful friend so moving away from that

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.520 
faithful friend so moving away from that
is<00:03:16.360> always<00:03:16.450> quite<00:03:16.690> hard<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.380> I'll<00:03:17.440> be

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
is always quite hard to do so I'll be

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.140 
is always quite hard to do so I'll be
interested<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.890> see<00:03:18.070> how<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.400> compares<00:03:18.549> how<00:03:19.030> it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
interested to see how it compares how it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.720 
interested to see how it compares how it
stacks<00:03:19.390> up<00:03:19.540> against<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> Peter<00:03:20.500> anyway<00:03:21.250> so

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
stacks up against the Peter anyway so

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.949 
stacks up against the Peter anyway so
that's<00:03:21.940> enough<00:03:22.150> about<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.390> I'm<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.900> to

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that's enough about that I'm going to
