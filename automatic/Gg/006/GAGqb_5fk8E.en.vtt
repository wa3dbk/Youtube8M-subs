00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.349 
I'd struggled with my hair for years
only<00:00:04.080> because<00:00:04.470> my<00:00:04.649> hair<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:04.890> very<00:00:04.979> fine<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:06.000> had

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
only because my hair is very fine I had

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.890 
only because my hair is very fine I had
had<00:00:06.540> some<00:00:06.690> recession<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:08.510> right<00:00:09.510> after<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
had some recession in here right after I

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.650 
had some recession in here right after I
noticed<00:00:10.350> that<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.799> went<00:00:11.129> to<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.789> my<00:00:11.940> father<00:00:12.180> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
noticed that I went to see my father and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.560 
noticed that I went to see my father and
I<00:00:13.379> realized<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.100> I<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.940> getting<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> same

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.099 
I realized that I was getting the same
hairline<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:16.680> father<00:00:16.920> had<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.630> decided

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
hairline that my father had so I decided

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.800 
hairline that my father had so I decided
that<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.679> would<00:00:19.800> start<00:00:20.220> using<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.640> comb<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.179> I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that I would start using the comb and I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.749 
that I would start using the comb and I
spoke<00:00:22.169> with<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.470> hairdresser<00:00:22.679> and<00:00:23.249> I<00:00:23.339> told<00:00:23.580> him

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.150 
spoke with my hairdresser and I told him
what<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.119> doing<00:00:24.179> and<00:00:24.749> I<00:00:25.320> asked<00:00:25.679> him<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:25.980> keep

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

and<00:00:37.740> another<00:00:38.670> area<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.360> also

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and another area that I think also

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.140 
and another area that I think also
although<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.410> can't<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> I've<00:00:41.670> always<00:00:42.000> had

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
although I can't see it I've always had

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.960 
although I can't see it I've always had
kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.720> flat<00:00:43.170> spot<00:00:43.470> here<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.220> that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
kind of a little flat spot here and that

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.720 
kind of a little flat spot here and that
became<00:00:45.570> less<00:00:46.470> of<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.740> problem<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.370> having<00:00:47.490> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
became less of a problem I was having to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
became less of a problem I was having to
do<00:00:47.850> less<00:00:48.060> teasing<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:48.930> becoming<00:00:49.380> a<00:00:49.530> little

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
do less teasing it was becoming a little

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.970 
do less teasing it was becoming a little
fuller<00:00:50.040> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.150> as<00:00:51.420> well<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.770> was

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fuller in the back as well so I was

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.550 
fuller in the back as well so I was
really<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.610> very<00:00:54.120> happy<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
really very very happy with it well it's

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.380 
really very very happy with it well it's
my<00:00:55.710> understanding<00:00:55.740> that<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:57.060> light

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
my understanding that the light

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
my understanding that the light
stimulates<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.410> hair<00:00:58.590> follicles<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.310> grow

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
stimulates the hair follicles to grow

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.830 
stimulates the hair follicles to grow
and<00:00:59.880> I<00:00:59.970> know<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.570> gross

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and I know that's a gross

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.890 
and I know that's a gross
oversimplification<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.420> best

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
oversimplification but that's the best

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.420 
oversimplification but that's the best
way<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> usually<00:01:04.559> describe<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> people

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
way that I usually describe it to people

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.889 
way that I usually describe it to people
I<00:01:05.990> really<00:01:06.990> am<00:01:07.200> such<00:01:07.859> a<00:01:07.890> believer<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.789> this<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
I really am such a believer in this that

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.830 
I really am such a believer in this that
I<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> watch<00:01:11.429> myself<00:01:11.759> because<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.539> I<00:01:12.659> go
