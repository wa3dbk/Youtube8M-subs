last tutorial drum rack tutorial 3 I

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570 
last tutorial drum rack tutorial 3 I
showed<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.870> how<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.799> customized

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
showed you how to do a customized

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.390 
showed you how to do a customized
slicing<00:00:09.210> preset<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.620> time<00:00:10.889> I'll<00:00:11.130> show<00:00:11.340> you

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
slicing preset this time I'll show you

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640 
slicing preset this time I'll show you
how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:12.179> more<00:00:12.360> mapping<00:00:12.660> after<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
how to do some more mapping after you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.490 
how to do some more mapping after you
have<00:00:13.830> done<00:00:14.009> some<00:00:14.190> slicing<00:00:14.929> let's<00:00:15.929> start<00:00:16.230> here

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
have done some slicing let's start here

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.599 
have done some slicing let's start here
I<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:17.400> an<00:00:17.520> Amon<00:00:17.850> break<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:20.010> nothing<00:00:20.400> has

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I have an Amon break but nothing has

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.840 
I have an Amon break but nothing has
been<00:00:20.640> mapped<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> macro<00:00:22.289> knobs<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.580> let's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
been mapped to the macro knobs so let's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.660 
been mapped to the macro knobs so let's
say<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.330> want<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.750> apply<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> filter<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
say I want to apply the filter to the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.759 
say I want to apply the filter to the
knobs<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.240> want<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.630> able<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> control<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
knobs I want to be able to control the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.179 
knobs I want to be able to control the
filter<00:00:28.949> when<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.460> turn<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> knob<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.949> here<00:00:31.949> let's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
filter when I turn a knob so here let's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
filter when I turn a knob so here let's
see<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> filter<00:00:33.239> frequency<00:00:33.590> right

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
see I have the filter frequency right

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.510 
see I have the filter frequency right
click<00:00:34.920> map<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.000> macro<00:00:36.390> 8<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:37.500> let's<00:00:38.129> check<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
click map to macro 8 well let's check it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.600 
click map to macro 8 well let's check it
out<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:43.170> problem<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
out the problem here is that the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.850 
out the problem here is that the
filtering<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.450> only<00:00:45.750> been<00:00:45.989> applied<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> one

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
filtering has only been applied to one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
filtering has only been applied to one
of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> slices<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of the slices and not all of them but I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.049 
of the slices and not all of them but I
would<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> map<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
would like to map it to all of the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.290 
would like to map it to all of the
slices<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:52.100> well<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
slices that I have well go here the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.619 
slices that I have well go here the
filter<00:00:54.629> frequency<00:00:55.760> right<00:00:56.760> click<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
filter frequency right click and you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.569 
filter frequency right click and you
will<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.960> map<00:00:58.350> 2<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.739> siblings<00:01:00.020> click<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
will see map 2 all siblings click and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.920 
will see map 2 all siblings click and
let's<00:01:02.579> check<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:05.510> well<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.750> pretty

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
let's check it out well that's pretty

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.560 
let's check it out well that's pretty
easy<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.070> saves<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.030> time<00:01:09.330> as

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
easy and it saves you a lot of time as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
easy and it saves you a lot of time as
you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you don't really have to do a lot of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.140 
you don't really have to do a lot of
manual<00:01:12.000> labor<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:13.409> feature<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.580> really

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
manual labor this feature is not really

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
manual labor this feature is not really
available<00:01:15.380> unless<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:17.159> hacking

you're using I'm using Live 8.4 d7 and
here<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.689> text<00:02:04.200> file<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
here make it a text file and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.969 
here make it a text file and
Kollek<00:02:07.760> options

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
Kollek options

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.150 
Kollek options
and<00:02:10.989> will<00:02:11.989> I<00:02:12.110> have<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.379> there<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.860> I'll<00:02:12.980> just

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and will I have it there so I'll just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.839 
and will I have it there so I'll just
replace<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.769> next<00:02:15.920> time<00:02:16.129> you<00:02:16.400> start

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
replace it and the next time you start

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.940 
replace it and the next time you start
up<00:02:17.030> live<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.780> will<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.349> same<00:02:18.530> option

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
up live you will have the same option

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.449 
up live you will have the same option
just<00:02:19.310> try<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:20.019> well<00:02:21.019> that's<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.040> now

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
just try it well that's it for now

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.870 
just try it well that's it for now
I<00:02:22.489> hope<00:02:23.030> that's<00:02:23.269> useful<00:02:23.450> for<00:02:23.660> you
