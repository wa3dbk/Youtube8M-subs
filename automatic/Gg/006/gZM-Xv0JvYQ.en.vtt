00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
about just three soups yeah I think
they're<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.409> three<00:01:28.799> soups<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.579> might

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
they're just three soups but one might

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.289 
they're just three soups but one might
be<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:30.180> flavor<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.920> sure<00:01:32.299> Lego

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
