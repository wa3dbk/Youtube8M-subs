00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
will add a sub component then I name the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.000 
will add a sub component then I name the
sub<00:00:23.010> component<00:00:23.640> plane<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.350> give<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.769> sub

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
sub component plane and I give that sub

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.509 
sub component plane and I give that sub
component<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> 3d<00:00:27.210> shape<00:00:27.680> I've<00:00:28.680> downloaded<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.200 

next<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.110> add<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.470> second<00:00:36.950> sub<00:00:37.160> component<00:00:37.760> which

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
next I add a second sub component which

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.870 
next I add a second sub component which
will<00:00:38.420> be<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.750> propeller<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.489> then<00:00:40.489> give<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
will be the propeller I then give it the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.389 
will be the propeller I then give it the
name<00:00:41.090> propeller<00:00:41.570> then<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.559> use<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.160> right

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
name propeller then I use the right

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.610 
name propeller then I use the right
arrow<00:00:43.700> at<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.000> top<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.660> move<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.020> into<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
arrow at the top to move it into the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.340 
arrow at the top to move it into the
plane<00:00:45.970> these<00:00:46.970> buttons<00:00:47.360> at<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.540> top<00:00:47.660> let<00:00:48.199> you

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
plane these buttons at the top let you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.860 
plane these buttons at the top let you
move<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.829> component<00:00:49.160> up<00:00:49.520> or<00:00:49.790> down<00:00:50.000> move<00:00:50.750> it

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
move the component up or down move it

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.100 
move the component up or down move it
into<00:00:51.110> other<00:00:51.470> objects<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.699> forth<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.239> want

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
into other objects and so forth I want

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.140 
into other objects and so forth I want
to<00:00:54.199> move<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.470> inside<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.190> airplane<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.850> use

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
to move it inside the airplane so I use

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.529 
to move it inside the airplane so I use
the<00:00:56.390> right<00:00:56.600> arrow

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
the right arrow

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.980 
the right arrow
next<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.350> give<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.739> 3d<00:01:00.160> shape<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.760> propeller

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
next I give it a 3d shape of a propeller

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.990 
next I give it a 3d shape of a propeller
I<00:01:03.020> then<00:01:03.560> move<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:03.980> propeller<00:01:04.190> shape<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
I then move the propeller shape to the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.660 
I then move the propeller shape to the
end<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.450> airplanes<00:01:05.900> nose<00:01:06.280> make<00:01:07.280> sure<00:01:07.520> that

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
end of the airplanes nose make sure that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.430 
end of the airplanes nose make sure that
you<00:01:07.820> position<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.390> properly<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.990> all<00:01:09.140> three

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
you position it properly in all three

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.940 
you position it properly in all three
axes

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.060 

next<00:01:13.610> we<00:01:13.729> give<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.030> propeller<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.509> career

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
next we give the propeller the career

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.610 
next we give the propeller the career
rotation<00:01:15.550> point<00:01:15.840> right<00:01:16.840> now<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.110> propeller

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
rotation point right now the propeller

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.770 
rotation point right now the propeller
rotates<00:01:18.070> around<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.490> wrong<00:01:18.670> access<00:01:19.150> point<00:01:19.450> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
rotates around the wrong access point to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.290 
rotates around the wrong access point to
fix<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.920> configure<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.580> rotation<00:01:22.090> point

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
fix that we configure the rotation point

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.560 
fix that we configure the rotation point
using<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.900> midpoint<00:01:23.170> z<00:01:23.920> control<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.820> the

move<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.440> timeline<00:02:08.740> ahead<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.430> certain<00:02:09.940> amount

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
move the timeline ahead a certain amount

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.230 
move the timeline ahead a certain amount
of<00:02:10.240> time<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:10.780> spin<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.800> propeller<00:02:12.190> then<00:02:13.120> I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
of time and spin the propeller then I

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.120 
of time and spin the propeller then I
right-click<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.960> animation<00:02:14.440> panel<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
right-click in the animation panel and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.660 
right-click in the animation panel and
choose<00:02:15.550> add<00:02:15.790> component<00:02:16.020> keyframe<00:02:17.020> again<00:02:17.670> at

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
choose add component keyframe again at

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.580 
choose add component keyframe again at
this<00:02:18.940> point<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.660> reset<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.290> run<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
this point I can reset and run the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.500 
this point I can reset and run the
animation<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.430> should<00:02:21.730> see<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.120> propeller

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
animation and I should see the propeller

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.110 
animation and I should see the propeller
spinning<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:24.370> how<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.640> create<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
spinning so that's how you create a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.120 
spinning so that's how you create a
basic<00:02:25.210> animation<00:02:26.140> using<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.770> animation

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
basic animation using the animation

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.480 
basic animation using the animation
created

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.550
