00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello everyone today I bring you the step 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.949
 number 13 of exo zombies estuary 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.960
 we are on the map of this charm 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.060
 vance warfare and say that this is the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.919
 final step does not have much history 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
 although it is a bit complicated but what 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.770
 only we have to do we come 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.119
 here to the room is where was the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.890
 computer and we have to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.540
 teleport with the machine that we have 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.579
 turned on in the step of the numbers that 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.180
 we have turned on this machine although not 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.620
 it was seen in the step that I did but already 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.230
 we turned on that machine and we have 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.149
 to bring teleport bradon all 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.219
 the companions here to this kind of 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.579
 dimension to this room or as you want 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.679
 call you where the bus appears or 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.539
 the bus that leaves on the map out 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.999
 break as you can see there we can improve the 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.010
 weapon and it seems with a dimension like a 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.109
 weird place not like there's no fund there 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.100
 It has no end 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.620
 good here what we're going to have to 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.329
 make simple and we just have to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.960
 endure worth are going to be several waves 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.360
 in each wave we will be talking about a 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.720
 little and good we just have to 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.550
 hold on for a long time and that's it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 he has no more secret we hold some 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.280
 waves or we are talking and little more 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.530
 when these waves are over we 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.500
 teleport all the map to another 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 time and it will be over the interest will give us 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.420
 what is the achievement and then it will start 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.670
 a second round is worth the second 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.470
 return as you want to call it sure 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.800
 You have already seen many places in the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.840
 second round bones and the second round 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.610
 let's say it's like the game goes back to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 start again from scratch returns to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.790
 start as little at the beginning not with the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.070
 pistolita and all that what happens that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.890
 this time it will be black and white 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.050
 and the points will not appear 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.850
 they will give us points for shooting at 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.979
 zombies will only give us points for 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 zombies kill or be killed once 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.030
 they give us the points but for shooting 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.220
 with the bullets themselves they will not give us 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.009
 points like when we play now normal 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.470
 and then if they throw us on the ground 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.880
 zombies we are going to die directly that is 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.850
 will not be able to revive any 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.190
 mate you die of the pull is worth so 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.810
 nothing basically this was to be good 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.210
 this is the final step as you see then 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 we have to put up with a bit here and what 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.050
 what have I told you when we 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.580
 teleportation again to the map it 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.870
 The game will end in the achievement 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.610
 and then that happens that I told you about 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.820
 the second round the second round 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.370
 we can return again to kill of and 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.920
 then they would give us another trophy worth 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.420
 kill voice for the second time in difficult 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.610
 we could say no it would be blank and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.260
 black and all that sure that what 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.420
 you have seen in more places if someone 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.680
 Interested in climbing as we did then 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.890
 Well, there were some but 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.180
 it has more history as good justly 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.310
 here when is when they give us the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.740
 trophy and little else and then the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 second round and it is black and white 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.060
 what is being said here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.060
 As you can see, they do not look like that, they do not give us 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.650
 points for killing zombies and such 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.150
 that is , they give us forgiveness, they give us points for 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.730
 kill zombies but not by shooting them 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.819
 It is worth and little more and the points for that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.129
 they do not look and such 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.530
 now right here as you see is the 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.180
 trophy that you get with the easter ec vale 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.730
 when doing it from the second round they give you 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.989
 another trophy that goes to the right and little 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.340
 it's better so nothing this has been the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.299
 final step I hope you liked it and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.590
