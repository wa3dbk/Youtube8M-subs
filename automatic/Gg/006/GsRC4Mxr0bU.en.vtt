none<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.560> matters<00:04:53.890> it's<00:04:54.070> really<00:04:54.220> just

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
none of that matters it's really just

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.580 
none of that matters it's really just
like<00:04:54.460> everything<00:04:55.090> below<00:04:55.360> than<00:04:55.690> 1600<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.470> not

like everything below than 1600 and not

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.110 
like everything below than 1600 and not
more<00:04:56.800> or<00:04:56.980> less<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.640> that's<00:04:57.760> probably<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.060> best

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
more or less so that's probably the best
