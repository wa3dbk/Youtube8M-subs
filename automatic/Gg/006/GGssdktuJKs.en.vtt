00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
the fastest so let's get started so we

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.640 
the fastest so let's get started so we
have<00:00:36.350> here<00:00:36.620> is<00:00:36.800> start<00:00:37.520> off<00:00:37.610> with<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.880> hoe<00:00:38.650> so

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
have here is start off with the hoe so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.550 
have here is start off with the hoe so
as<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.310> can<00:00:40.490> see<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.970> hole<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:41.990> not<00:00:42.290> very

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
as you can see a hole it's not very

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.750 
as you can see a hole it's not very
effective<00:00:43.060> so<00:00:44.060> it's<00:00:44.240> taking<00:00:44.690> about<00:00:45.730> I'd<00:00:46.730> say

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
effective so it's taking about I'd say

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.290 
effective so it's taking about I'd say
just<00:00:47.600> as<00:00:47.720> long<00:00:47.900> as<00:00:48.050> city<00:00:48.590> into<00:00:49.010> mine<00:00:49.220> so<00:00:50.090> that's

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
just as long as city into mine so that's

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.910 
just as long as city into mine so that's
not<00:00:50.480> very<00:00:50.690> effective<00:00:51.170> let's<00:00:51.530> take<00:00:51.710> our<00:00:51.830> blocks
