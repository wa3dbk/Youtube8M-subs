00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
now we're I'm not going to measure out

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.279 
now we're I'm not going to measure out
the<00:05:30.179> the<00:05:31.179> cinnamon<00:05:31.569> or<00:05:31.689> anything<00:05:31.989> the

the the cinnamon or anything the

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.929 
the the cinnamon or anything the
disadvantage<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.979> having<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.519> cinnamon

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:33.939 
disadvantage of having the cinnamon

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.909 
disadvantage of having the cinnamon
sticks<00:05:34.209> as<00:05:34.689> you<00:05:34.839> can't<00:05:35.049> really<00:05:35.229> change<00:05:35.679> the

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
sticks as you can't really change the

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.409 
sticks as you can't really change the
level<00:05:36.189> of<00:05:36.249> cinnamon<00:05:36.639> it's<00:05:36.819> already<00:05:37.089> in<00:05:37.239> there

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
level of cinnamon it's already in there

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.209 
level of cinnamon it's already in there
with<00:05:37.989> the<00:05:38.319> ground<00:05:38.499> cinnamon<00:05:38.739> doing<00:05:39.099> it

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
with the ground cinnamon doing it

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.819 
with the ground cinnamon doing it
afterwards<00:05:39.899> you<00:05:40.899> get<00:05:41.079> just<00:05:41.259> as<00:05:41.409> much<00:05:41.439> flavor

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:41.829 
afterwards you get just as much flavor

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.619 
afterwards you get just as much flavor
and<00:05:42.309> you're<00:05:42.519> able<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:42.789> adjust<00:05:43.209> that<00:05:43.329> a<00:05:43.389> little

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
and you're able to adjust that a little

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.049 
and you're able to adjust that a little
bit<00:05:43.689> I<00:05:43.899> mentioned<00:05:44.679> the<00:05:44.979> lot<00:05:45.819> of<00:05:45.909> recipes
