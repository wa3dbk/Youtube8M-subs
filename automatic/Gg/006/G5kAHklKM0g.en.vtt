00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 German parliament be the last 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 that is, we have a day of travel 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 600 km long stage just all the cars 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 band that I owe to what comes of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.960
 maximum speed this mass 3 e 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.740
 we will have to arrive in Frankfurt for 5 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.660
 this afternoon 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.660

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.589
 right now 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.660
 the destination at 190 degrees above all 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.610
 there are not 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.740
 the limits 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.450
 of speed and breath we can 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.450
 for a budget of how 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.210
 I speak of what we are most objective 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.340
 things that I liked first 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.430
 successful style 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.090
 according to draft 3 this is very beautiful 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.680
 my personal said he was out in 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 Secondly, the road behavior 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 a compromise 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.110
 the nature of this meeting of this 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.820
 sense of ostension enough 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.630
 maximum tourist allowed to present two 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.120
 16 inches 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.340
 the new system that does telematics 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.560
 of the poker that works a lot 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.320
 well and it's very intuitive what is it to me 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.880
 liked soundproofing but a 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.950
 rolling level of private individuals 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.800
 according to you a bit invasive of life 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.140
 limited rear visibility the most 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.670
 dark much smaller and it was 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.270
 sacrificed on the plate of aesthetics 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.550
 of the car and third some 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.080
 comfort details such as the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 electric windows that don't 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 automatically lowers per passenger 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.430
 front and back own 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.100
 thorough which gives appointment at the end 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 September on every car when we find it 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.260
 the 2200 diesel version 150 channels is 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.619
 but probably the most 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:12.869
 interesting requests and we have been to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.869
 frankfurt the crazy design center without 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:34.500
 healthy thanks to everyone
