00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.290
 hello let's do a tutorial on how 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.719
 make a heart-shaped hanger 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.390
 As I have already explained in the photos I have 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.000
 I picked bits of cloth that I had 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.040
 cut in the shape of the heart I have picked 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.450
 a tape in this yellow case like this 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:31.329
 decorative and nothing is very easy we go 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.329
 to put like this 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.450
 and we're going to start sewing on the side 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.790
 top and we're going to leave two fingers here 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.240
 on the side to then be able to put the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.650
 wadding let's sew it up let's give two 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.040
 so we're going to give it an air 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.040
 carefree 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.800
 you could have cut the heart too 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.090
 with scissors zig zag shaped it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.480
 you could have done any other 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.480
 shape 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.040
 Here we go 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840
 it does not have to be 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.060
 we cut into the remaining threads and now 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.060
 I told you 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.580
 will make another offer 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.850
 It does not have to be above us 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 has to why we are 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.950
 if you use 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.790
 we could have used 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.349
 we cut wines centuries 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.310
 i 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.310
 but no 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.780
 and now 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.659
 I think it has left little space 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.639
 if this happens to you what you can use 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.639
 something for your health 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.080
 for example a stick like that a bowl and with 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.690
 plugs 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.690
 better a stick that is not dyed then 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.190
 to 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.599
 you put the wadding on the inside 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 shape with 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 if you think you need more you put 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.260
 more in this case I'm going to leave it like this and 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.459
 Now what I'm going to do is close this 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.459
 piece that remains open 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:05.650
 as we have done two laps now the 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:08.770
 turns and I do and it's already here we have 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.960
 a stuffed heart 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.830
 to hang it where you want us in the 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.730
 room at the door or whatever or 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.880
 you can use it to put the needles 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.070
 but you have also done this in 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.520
 heart 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.150
 Elephants in white highlights more 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.150
 in this case 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.379
 and later
