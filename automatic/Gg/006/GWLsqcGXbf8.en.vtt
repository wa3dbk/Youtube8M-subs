00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.110 
for about two years I've had it you know
probably<00:02:22.099> about<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.340> hundred<00:02:22.430> times<00:02:22.670> perfect

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
probably about a hundred times perfect

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
probably about a hundred times perfect
in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.239> foam<00:02:23.390> pit<00:02:23.420> about<00:02:24.290> 10,000<00:02:24.800> times<00:02:24.950> not

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
in the foam pit about 10,000 times not

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.970 
in the foam pit about 10,000 times not
perfect<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.660> snap<00:02:27.410> with<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
perfect so it's just a snap with the
