00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.149
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:23.410
 Hello, Hankyoreh 0.54 Commissioner Lee Won-jae will start competing 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.099
 I wonder today why being in an amusement park entrance fees so expensive these questions 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.490
 I would like to share with you the management strategy 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.490
 I'll do it 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.640
 222 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.690
 One day, the cell phone company's call came in. 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:46.160
 I'm using a mobile phone, 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.940
 He has to change the service plan to a more expensive base rate 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.940
 Later it was before 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.620
 On the west side of mobile communication, I recently talked about the pattern of phone usage 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.430
 I think if you change the product to a more expensive base 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.229
 Then I could save some money. He convinced me. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 The telephone bill is composed of the basic fee and the fee per minute. 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 There is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.780
 Did not you think that this plan was a little strange? 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.440
 It's a unique plan. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.710
 I have been adopting this unusual pricing system. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 Will 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.680
 If you go to a Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood, is this possible? 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.680
 And then you get another food price . 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.899
 Of course, the food will be cheaper. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.950
 The telecommunications company's home system is similar to this mechanism 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:47.330
 The price system that mobile phone companies adopt 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.360
 Part 2 price is called 2nd pac cherry 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.990
 If the consumer buys something under 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.509
 First, you have to buy the right to buy things. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.580
 And then, when you actually spend the product, it's a little more 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.260
 You will pay the price 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:13.620
 The fact that it is not only the mobile phone unit price Example 2 is an amusement park or 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.540
 Public services such as water and electricity, shaver companies, and golf courses. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.830
 Use 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.750
 2 unit through the second company the price is, without reducing the volume 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.140
 We can maximize profits because the price per product does not increase 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.860
 As a consumer, there is no reason to reduce usage. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 And if the admission is not higher than the consumer who is not from the entire consumption 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:41.670
 I will gladly pay for the admission and start using it. 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.640
 The very traditional example used to analyze the second part price body is the debt 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.590
 Case. I lived in an amusement park . 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.950
 For example, do you remember those rides in Wolmido, Incheon? 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.840
 In the past, the entrance fee was not so expensive. 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:03.299
 Or pay the entry fee was very expensive one, and then the rides once in a position 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.220
 Buy tickets one at the ticket office in front of the rides and ride the rides 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.079
 I had to write 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:14.700
 That's why we only go in without entering the entrance fee or entrance fee. 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:20.069
 Pick up a little rides, or just shop for a kid 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.780
 But nowadays Everland is the place to play in Seoul Land 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.040
 If you go to the park. 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:31.349
 The situation has changed completely . Tickets are very expensive. 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.459
 And the Big Fibnick Big Slin sells only those bundles that are very expensive. 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.180
 There is 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:41.370
 It is very difficult to ride only one rides. 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:46.200
 Relative freedom buiIding priced look very cheap price 0 Issues 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.000
 At Disneyland, the ticket itself is a free pass, 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.190
 High 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.930
 I have tried several pricing strategies for a long time and the pricing strategy in the amusement park 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.190
 Lower the fee 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:05.020
 It was arranged in such a way as to increase the admission fee . 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:08.050
 It is very strong 2 part price is to adopt the sin 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.190
 Reasons for raising admission fees for amusement parks 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.320
 Because the consumer's tendency to visit the amusement park is similar, 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.930
 You can guess 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.630
 Even if you increase or decrease the use rate of the rides 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:26.290
 The number of times the person who visited the amusement park once rides does not change much 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.460
 I can tell you this story. 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.260
 In addition, the greater the monopoly power of one company, 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.440
 I will have more room. 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:40.090
 Polaroid Electricity and Water Amusement Park Mobile phones are both monopoly industries 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.960
 You'll know. 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.350
 It's an industry that does not have many competitors. 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.760
 You need to think of Polaroid to buy an instant camera . 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.950
 And I went ahead and took the children home for the weekend to go somewhere rather than an amusement park 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.070
 There is no big alternative. 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:05.980
 If you keep thinking about it, you'll still have the option of increasing your base rate 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:08.200
 It's so fun to convince a cell phone or company to choose 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.370
 Here's why not 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.750
 I am worried that more and more industries are getting worse. 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.330
 It's possible 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.330
 If Obon is here today, thank you. 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.289
