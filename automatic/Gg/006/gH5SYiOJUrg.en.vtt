00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
like fifa it's like it's for example i

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.140 
like fifa it's like it's for example i
can<00:01:46.680> fee<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> score<00:01:47.369> goal<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> there's

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.609 
no animation like there's no cut in the
in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.330> game<00:01:51.600> plan<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.380> one

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
in the game plan I think it's just one

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
in the game plan I think it's just one
straight<00:01:53.390> flowing<00:01:54.390> bit<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> gameplay<00:01:55.680> from

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
straight flowing bit of gameplay from

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 
straight flowing bit of gameplay from
the<00:01:56.070> goal<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> celebration<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.600> get

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the goal to the celebration and you get

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
the goal to the celebration and you get
to<00:01:57.840> control<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.229> celebration<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.830> they<00:01:58.920> be

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to control the celebration so they be

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
to control the celebration so they be
quite<00:01:59.250> cool<00:01:59.490> I<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.630> maybe<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.869> could

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
also while map that goal kicking think

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.110 
also while map that goal kicking think
they<00:02:26.680> need<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:27.040> goalkicking<00:02:27.520> animations

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120

stances and all that sort of stuff and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.720 
stances and all that sort of stuff and
I'm<00:02:32.170> comparing<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.650> FIFA<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:33.190> there's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
I'm comparing it to FIFA but there's

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.720 
I'm comparing it to FIFA but there's
anything<00:02:34.000> we<00:02:34.180> got<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.420> compare<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:35.730> but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
anything we got to compare it really but

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
anything we got to compare it really but
yeah<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.380> they<00:02:38.380> should<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:38.590> different

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
yeah like they should have different

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.020 
yeah like they should have different
styles<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.280> kicking<00:02:39.520> as<00:02:39.580> well<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.940> example

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
styles of kicking as well for example

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.420 
styles of kicking as well for example
Hawkinson<00:02:40.810> kicks<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.560> dead<00:02:41.710> straight<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:42.250> know

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
Hawkinson kicks it dead straight I know

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.890 
Hawkinson kicks it dead straight I know
you<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.580> kind<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.180> somewhat<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
you can kind of do this somewhat in the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.870 
you can kind of do this somewhat in the
game<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.040> wind<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.430> plays<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> big

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
game but the wind really plays a big

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
game but the wind really plays a big
part<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.240> but<00:02:47.200> Hawkinson<00:02:47.890> keeps<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> dead

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
part in that but Hawkinson keeps it dead

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.670 
part in that but Hawkinson keeps it dead
straight<00:02:48.780> whereas<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.320> get<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
straight whereas you know you get the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.590 
straight whereas you know you get the

and this is rapidly but just like some
more<00:03:43.990> animations<00:03:44.500> would<00:03:44.620> be<00:03:44.740> nice<00:03:45.000> instead<00:03:46.000> of

I'm<00:04:14.890> thinking<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> corner<00:04:16.570> now<00:04:16.780> I

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
I'm thinking is in the corner now I

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.449 
I'm thinking is in the corner now I
think<00:04:17.080> I've<00:04:17.169> seen<00:04:17.290> at<00:04:17.470> once<00:04:17.650> where<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> player

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
think I've seen at once where the player

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
think I've seen at once where the player
will<00:04:18.580> come<00:04:18.730> over<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.209> do<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.630> tackler<00:04:19.900> around

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
will come over and do a tackler around

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.780 
will come over and do a tackler around
the<00:04:20.230> lake<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.530> try<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.739> force<00:04:20.980> amount<00:04:21.310> but<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
the lake and try and force amount but it

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.270 
the lake and try and force amount but it
doesn't<00:04:22.030> happen<00:04:22.120> enough<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.950> know<00:04:24.070> maybe

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
doesn't happen enough so you know maybe

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.469 
doesn't happen enough so you know maybe
they<00:04:24.370> should<00:04:24.520> put<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:24.820> up<00:04:24.940> more<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.390> a

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
they should put that up more of a

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.700 
they should put that up more of a
challenge<00:04:25.690> if<00:04:25.990> you're<00:04:26.110> coming<00:04:26.290> over<00:04:26.440> on<00:04:26.650> a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.100 
challenge if you're coming over on a
winger<00:04:26.950> rather<00:04:27.190> than<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.729> generic

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
winger rather than just the generic

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.810 
winger rather than just the generic
tackle<00:04:29.110> because<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.070> have<00:04:30.310> more<00:04:30.460> oil

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
tackle because it you have more oil

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.700 
tackle because it you have more oil
see<00:04:30.970> when<00:04:31.210> you're<00:04:31.330> coming<00:04:31.630> flying<00:04:31.840> across<00:04:32.110> for
