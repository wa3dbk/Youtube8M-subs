one thing to notice is the articulation
just<00:02:53.129> figure<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.760> joints<00:02:54.389> are<00:02:54.510> loose<00:02:54.690> I'm<00:02:54.930> not

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
just figure the joints are loose I'm not

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.530 
just figure the joints are loose I'm not
sure<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.379> it's<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:55.799> my<00:02:56.069> figure<00:02:56.540> maybe

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
sure if it's just my figure maybe

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.589 
sure if it's just my figure maybe
because<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.170> been<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> couple<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.680> years<00:02:59.599> the

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
because it's been a couple of years the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.809 
because it's been a couple of years the
plastics<00:03:01.049> got<00:03:01.290> looser<00:03:01.799> or<00:03:02.010> maybe<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.549> was<00:03:02.639> just

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
plastics got looser or maybe it was just

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.119 
plastics got looser or maybe it was just
bought<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:03.510> way<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.709> joints<00:03:05.010> are

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129
