going<00:05:53.989> to

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.529 

will<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.800> find<00:06:13.009> anything<00:06:13.370> or<00:06:13.999> will<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.300> find

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
will it find anything or will it find

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.659 
will it find anything or will it find
some<00:06:14.900> completely<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:15.800> utterly<00:06:15.860> random<00:06:16.370> songs

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
some completely and utterly random songs

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.170 
some completely and utterly random songs
I<00:06:17.590> think<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:19.039> second<00:06:19.400> option<00:06:19.520> is<00:06:19.789> much<00:06:20.029> more

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
I think the second option is much more

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:29.350 
I think the second option is much more
likely<00:06:23.650> struggling<00:06:24.650> to<00:06:24.740> find<00:06:24.860> anything<00:06:28.360> nope

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
likely struggling to find anything nope

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360 
likely struggling to find anything nope
no<00:06:29.839> luck<00:06:30.080> so<00:06:30.319> I'm<00:06:30.589> going<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.860> skip<00:06:31.099> to<00:06:31.129> further

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
no luck so I'm going to skip to further

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:47.240 
no luck so I'm going to skip to further
on<00:06:31.550> in<00:06:31.669> the<00:06:31.699> song<00:06:31.939> see<00:06:32.389> if<00:06:32.479> that<00:06:32.599> helps

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250
