with your fingertips until you make a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.440 
with your fingertips until you make a
rope<00:01:09.190> about<00:01:09.399> 16<00:01:10.240> inches<00:01:10.720> long<00:01:15.210> break<00:01:16.210> off

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.969 
about 1/3 of the length with the other
two-thirds<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.659> horseshoe<00:01:23.320> shape<00:01:23.680> and

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
two-thirds make a horseshoe shape and

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.899 
two-thirds make a horseshoe shape and
then<00:01:24.939> take<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.770> single<00:01:26.770> strip<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.430> place<00:01:27.670> it

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
then take the single strip and place it

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.780 
then take the single strip and place it
in<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.060> center<00:01:29.220> begin<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.369> braiding

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
in the center begin the braiding

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.550 
in the center begin the braiding
technique<00:01:31.270> just<00:01:31.570> as<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.840> would<00:01:31.990> be<00:01:32.110> braiding

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
technique just as you would be braiding

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.050 
technique just as you would be braiding
hair<00:01:32.890> by<00:01:33.790> overlapping<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:35.590> different<00:01:36.130> pieces

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
hair by overlapping the different pieces

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.520 
hair by overlapping the different pieces
one<00:01:37.750> over<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.320> other<00:01:39.540> until<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.570> create<00:01:41.049> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
one over the other until you create the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.770 
one over the other until you create the
shape<00:01:41.799> of<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.100> braid<00:01:44.729> pinch<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.030> edge<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.630> the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
shape of the braid pinch the edge so the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.209 
shape of the braid pinch the edge so the
dough<00:01:46.960> doesn't<00:01:46.990> unravel<00:01:47.649> during<00:01:48.399> baking<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
dough doesn't unravel during baking and

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.090 
dough doesn't unravel during baking and
this<00:01:51.219> is<00:01:51.460> what<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.909> should<00:01:52.180> see

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.550 

if<00:01:57.100> breeding<00:01:57.729> isn't<00:01:58.150> for<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:59.170> can<00:01:59.380> do<00:01:59.530> a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
if breeding isn't for you you can do a

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.310 
if breeding isn't for you you can do a
simpler<00:02:00.159> version<00:02:00.479> take<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.659> same<00:02:01.900> type<00:02:02.290> of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
simpler version take the same type of

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.539 
simpler version take the same type of
dough<00:02:02.740> size<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.759> golf<00:02:04.000> ball<00:02:04.890> roll<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.070> as<00:02:06.369> I

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
dough size of a golf ball roll it as I

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
dough size of a golf ball roll it as I
showed<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.850> before<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.990> do<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> little

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
kneading roll it into a long rope and as

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.890 
kneading roll it into a long rope and as
I<00:02:13.569> showed<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.430> time<00:02:15.730> only<00:02:16.000> about<00:02:16.300> 12

make a horseshoe again but this time use

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.809 
make a horseshoe again but this time use
just<00:02:28.660> braids<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.500> side<00:02:30.010> over<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.640> other

without the third piece

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.949 
without the third piece
you<00:02:33.940> still<00:02:34.239> get<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> twist<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.770> braid
