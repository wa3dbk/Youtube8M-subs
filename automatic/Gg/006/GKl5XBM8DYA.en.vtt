control which fields are available when

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.329 
control which fields are available when
you're<00:00:22.739> creating<00:00:23.159> and<00:00:23.400> editing<00:00:23.609> content<00:00:25.339> so

for example let me go ahead and log into

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.140 
for example let me go ahead and log into
our<00:00:30.089> site<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:33.110> I'll<00:00:34.110> show<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:35.150> what

we're talking about so I'm gonna go

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.230 
we're talking about so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> open<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.480> page<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
ahead and open up just a page here I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.060 
ahead and open up just a page here I
feel<00:00:42.240> we<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> new<00:00:42.660> page<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.950> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
feel we do a new page a little bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.050 
feel we do a new page a little bit
easier<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.060> this<00:00:45.500> had<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> page<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> right

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
easier so this had a page here and right

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.820 
easier so this had a page here and right
here<00:00:48.090> actually<00:00:48.540> we're<00:00:49.050> starting<00:00:49.380> to<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.560> the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
here actually we're starting to see the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.460 
here actually we're starting to see the
beginning<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.480> what's<00:00:51.480> something<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.990> gets

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
beginning of what's something that gets

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.040 
beginning of what's something that gets
created<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.490> use<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.540> create<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:54.960> own

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
created when you use and create your own

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970 
created when you use and create your own
field<00:00:55.380> sets<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:57.530> availability<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
field sets the availability here of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
field sets the availability here of
creating<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> standard<00:00:59.940> page<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:02.970> also

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
creating a standard page and then also

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.509 
creating a standard page and then also
all<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:03.600> fields<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.199> available<00:01:04.519> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
all the fields that are available so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.840 
all the fields that are available so
we're<00:01:05.670> seeing<00:01:05.880> title<00:01:06.479> slug<00:01:07.319> template<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
we're seeing title slug template in the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.499 
we're seeing title slug template in the
content<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.179> let's<00:01:12.390> go

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
content and that's it so now let's go

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.630 
content and that's it so now let's go
ahead<00:01:12.539> and<00:01:12.840> look<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.649> field<00:01:13.950> set<00:01:14.249> file

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
ahead and look at the field set file

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.620 
ahead and look at the field set file
that<00:01:14.999> controls<00:01:15.569> this<00:01:15.869> page<00:01:16.319> and<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.630> what

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that controls this page and then what

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.539 
that controls this page and then what
we'll<00:01:18.749> do<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.409> tutorial<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.100> add<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.850> new

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
we'll do in this tutorial is add a new

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.249 
we'll do in this tutorial is add a new
field<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.759> ahead<00:01:26.999> and<00:01:27.149> log<00:01:27.389> in<00:01:27.689> through<00:01:28.079> FTP

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
field so go ahead and log in through FTP

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
field so go ahead and log in through FTP
if<00:01:28.710> you're<00:01:28.859> working<00:01:29.039> locally<00:01:29.429> go<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.209> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
if you're working locally go to the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.499 
if you're working locally go to the
route<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:31.079> your<00:01:31.880> static<00:01:32.880> site<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
route where your static site is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
route where your static site is
installed<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> config

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
installed and go into the config

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.649 
installed and go into the config
directory<00:01:36.749> and<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.659> another

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
directory and there you will see another

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.889 
directory and there you will see another
directory<00:01:40.109> called<00:01:40.319> field<00:01:40.619> sets<00:01:41.479> go<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.749> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
directory called field sets go into that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.830 
directory called field sets go into that
and<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.859> default<00:01:44.399> there's<00:01:44.639> two<00:01:45.029> items<00:01:45.450> here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.900 

this<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.760> gamble<00:02:08.030> file<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.250> indention<00:02:10.790> is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
this is a gamble file so indention is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.540 
this is a gamble file so indention is
important<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:14.170> what<00:02:15.170> we're<00:02:15.350> gonna<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.920> here

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
important here what we're gonna see here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.900 
important here what we're gonna see here
is<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.690> starts<00:02:18.170> off<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.340> case<00:02:19.580> with

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
is that it starts off in this case with

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.110 
is that it starts off in this case with
a<00:02:20.530> field<00:02:21.970> called<00:02:22.970> title<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.310> it's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
a field called title and then it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.060 
a field called title and then it's
assigned<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.230> at<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.740> standard<00:02:28.220> page<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:30.070> when

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
assigned just at a standard page so when

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.430 
assigned just at a standard page so when
we<00:02:31.220> hit<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:35.390> seeing<00:02:35.660> standard<00:02:36.230> page

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
we hit this we're seeing standard page

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.370 
we hit this we're seeing standard page
here<00:02:36.920> that's<00:02:37.340> coming<00:02:37.670> from<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.140> is

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
here that's coming from this so this is

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.740 
here that's coming from this so this is
sort<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:41.410> creating<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:43.060> content<00:02:44.060> type<00:02:44.150> in

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
sort of like creating a content type in

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.360 
sort of like creating a content type in
a<00:02:44.870> way<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:47.180> field<00:02:48.080> sets<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.100> create

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
a way but field sets you can create

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.810 
a way but field sets you can create
multiple<00:02:49.610> field<00:02:50.240> sets<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.720> apply<00:02:50.990> them<00:02:51.290> to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
multiple field sets and apply them to

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.180 
multiple field sets and apply them to
you<00:02:52.820> know<00:02:52.940> multiple<00:02:53.180> types<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.320> it's<00:02:54.740> it's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
you know multiple types and so it's it's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.050 
you know multiple types and so it's it's
they're<00:02:55.520> not<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:56.020> exclusive<00:02:57.020> or<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.640> here<00:03:01.940> we

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
they're not like exclusive or so here we

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.930 
they're not like exclusive or so here we
see<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.360> opening<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.960> fields<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.760> now<00:03:04.760> we've

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
see the opening of fields and now we've

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.420 
see the opening of fields and now we've
seen<00:03:05.180> we're<00:03:05.540> seeing<00:03:05.870> here<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.650> three<00:03:06.980> fields

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
seen we're seeing here the three fields

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.260 
seen we're seeing here the three fields
that<00:03:07.880> are<00:03:08.290> available<00:03:09.489> for<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.550> page<00:03:10.850> by<00:03:11.209> default

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
that are available for a page by default

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:20.640 
that are available for a page by default
a<00:03:11.900> title<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:13.330> template<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:17.030> content<00:03:19.180> so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
a title a template and the content so

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.840 
a title a template and the content so
one<00:03:21.650> thing<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.070> we're<00:03:22.190> not<00:03:22.220> seeing<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
one thing that we're not seeing is the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.340 
one thing that we're not seeing is the
slug<00:03:23.330> that's<00:03:23.660> used<00:03:23.989> by<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.230> system<00:03:26.350> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
slug that's used by the system you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.729 
slug that's used by the system you
notice<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.800> some<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.850> fields<00:03:29.330> here<00:03:29.739> have

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
notice that some of the fields here have

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.410 
notice that some of the fields here have
different<00:03:31.100> settings<00:03:31.340> from<00:03:31.670> other<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.239> sort

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
different settings from other so it sort

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150 
different settings from other so it sort
of<00:03:32.450> depends<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.650> know<00:03:33.739> whether<00:03:33.920> or<00:03:34.040> not

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
of depends on you know whether or not

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.470 
of depends on you know whether or not
you<00:03:34.640> want<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> given<00:03:35.650> instructions<00:03:36.650> or<00:03:36.800> not<00:03:36.980> or

know you don't have to you know fill out

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.340 
know you don't have to you know fill out
all<00:03:46.459> these<00:03:46.640> attributes<00:03:46.820> for<00:03:47.360> everyone<00:03:47.780> but

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
all these attributes for everyone but

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.010 
all these attributes for everyone but
the<00:03:48.500> one<00:03:48.650> that's<00:03:48.830> sort<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.400> important<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.270> the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
the one that's sort of important is the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.520 
the one that's sort of important is the
type<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.370> under<00:03:53.090> content<00:03:53.750> we're<00:03:53.959> seeing<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
type so under content we're seeing a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.760 
type so under content we're seeing a
type<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:54.920> market<00:03:55.610> up<00:03:56.650> which<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:59.770> editor

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
type of market up which is this editor

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.430 
type of market up which is this editor
here<00:04:01.130> which<00:04:01.880> uses<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:03.680> language<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:06.019> we

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
here which uses that language if we

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.009 
here which uses that language if we
could<00:04:06.680> also<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:08.150> could<00:04:08.330> make<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.690> a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
could also we could make it just a

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.170 
could also we could make it just a
simple<00:04:09.980> text<00:04:10.220> area

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.210 

so<00:04:16.180> now<00:04:16.300> it's<00:04:16.450> just<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.690> text<00:04:16.900> area<00:04:17.370> we<00:04:18.370> could

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
so now it's just a text area we could

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.120 
so now it's just a text area we could
use<00:04:21.220> redactor<00:04:23.520> redactor<00:04:24.520> is<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:25.380> jquery<00:04:26.380> html5

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
use redactor redactor is a jquery html5

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.630 
use redactor redactor is a jquery html5
editor<00:04:28.020> which<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.800> kind<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.130> nice

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
editor which is kind of nice

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:43.590 
editor which is kind of nice
so<00:04:31.300> maybe<00:04:31.450> able<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.750> use<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:42.480> what<00:04:43.480> we

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
so maybe able to use this and what we

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.460 
so maybe able to use this and what we
want<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> do<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:45.090> create<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.480> new<00:04:46.720> custom<00:04:47.140> field

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
want to do is create a new custom field

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.040 
want to do is create a new custom field
so<00:04:48.040> let's<00:04:48.190> do<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.520> let's<00:04:48.880> create<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.870> note

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
another one we'll call it sub and the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:11.280 
another one we'll call it sub and the
display<00:05:03.390> is<00:05:04.390> gonna<00:05:04.630> be<00:05:04.840> sub<00:05:06.870> headline<00:05:10.290> default

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
display is gonna be sub headline default

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:20.070 
display is gonna be sub headline default
kind<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.800> blank<00:05:13.710> enter<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.690> what's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
kind of blank enter a so what's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.380 
kind of blank enter a so what's
important<00:05:20.530> about<00:05:20.590> this<00:05:21.010> here<00:05:21.490> is<00:05:21.700> this<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.210> the

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
important about this here is this is the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.790 
important about this here is this is the
template<00:05:22.900> tag<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:25.090> once<00:05:25.690> we<00:05:25.840> get<00:05:25.990> into<00:05:26.140> theming

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
template tag so once we get into theming

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.670 
template tag so once we get into theming
it's<00:05:27.460> this<00:05:28.030> that<00:05:28.330> goes<00:05:28.600> in<00:05:28.990> between<00:05:29.050> the

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
it's this that goes in between the

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.800 
it's this that goes in between the
double<00:05:29.980> curly<00:05:30.310> braces<00:05:30.550> so<00:05:31.450> let's<00:05:31.600> go<00:05:31.720> ahead

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
double curly braces so let's go ahead

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.840 
double curly braces so let's go ahead
and<00:05:31.930> hit<00:05:32.170> save<00:05:33.390> go<00:05:34.390> back<00:05:34.630> over<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.020> our<00:05:35.200> site
