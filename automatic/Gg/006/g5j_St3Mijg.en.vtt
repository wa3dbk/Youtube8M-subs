00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.289

 spend a good part of the horses and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 equestrian center ponies 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 during this time the quarries served 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.609
 from frame to several activities the party 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.800
 having started with motivated riders 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.800
 to start jumping 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.180
 for dawn the center instructor 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.479
 equestrian great organizer of this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.270
 day shows real fatigue the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.270
 balance sheet of the day gives him wings 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 magnificent 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:14.310
 for example does this experiment in the end 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 evening horse ball teams 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.110
 sadirac comfortable makes an appearance 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.660
 noticed the practice of this sport 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 spectacular requires qualities 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.780
 individual 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.720
 but the bear ball is a discipline that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.769
 focused on the collective game 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.989
 it is often said that it is a mixture 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.519
 between rugby and basketball because he 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.230
 there are contacts who are who are 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.670
 possible 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.829
 it's not a violent sport because it 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.650
 is it is run by rules necessarily 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.290
 As a result, he has very few injuries or 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.150
 horse players so it all goes well 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.190
 it is a sport before any collective 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.440
 I think in the middle 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.640
 equestrian is the only sport that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.750
 lets just work a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.080
 collective at the image of the day 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.910
 of basketball necessarily this group will be 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.560
 all the more powerful if the link 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080
 between the children in any case if these are 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.490
 friends outside and well in general 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.930
 works much better so there is a 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.910
 indoor group in the sport is 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.260
 a group also outside in 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.800
 the agreement we have with each other 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.290
 to others 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.330
 some reinforcements of riders or two 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.950
 riders would be welcome 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.030
 youth formations will begin the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.980
 season in october 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.300
 Damian and the stables of the windmill 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.300
