 our home 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.309

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.119

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.290

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 billy paul gautier 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.590
 ns 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.720

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.680
 messi 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 this activity 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.150
 is a municipality a anafre 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.790
 I recently had 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.860
 my life 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.750
 the third 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 ef 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.690
 my mind ends 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 I think not 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 nor 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.290
 as 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 notice moment 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.370
 in the past many 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.370
 so to succeed cristina 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.600
 according to residents of the region 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.050
 investors followed 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 two more was so the river is much later 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 and I'm here today 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 ae 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.460
 was immediate 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.559
 to elza of those that goes from the beginning of the night 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.819
 but as milan target is very low 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.030
 but it is impractical at the fair people can not talk that is why 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.459
 that his name is very low and that's what dissidents is bigger 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 ansa 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 is not it 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.709
 meditate 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 from exactly what he who compare 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.419
 when they enter the field 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 Christmas will yield 50% 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 my bottle of wine 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.349
 it's not like that 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.239
 in conversation with the soldiers - he has more information 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.779
 with the increase in population and the difficulties 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.369
 several people invade the most demanding near the rivers deforesting 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.489
 get them to get your boats 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.900
 one of the measures to solve this problem he takes away from those people 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.789
 regions and has exits to another location 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.729
 the march should be completed if reforestation of the 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.249
 local with plants and native forest 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.249
 bad 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.139
 about the controversial 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.449
 60% of the human body is composed of one year 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.829
 needs it directly for him and to develop 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.659
 approximately 95% of the world's water and 3% saline 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.939
 and 2% and drinking water 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.049
 the largest amount of fresh water can be found in glaciers and canyons 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.049
 polar 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.409
 neda agha 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.049
 talking to rtl radio then 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.639
 It is not simple yet 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.959
 exists but is also very dumb 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.440
 try not to walk loose many days of the week it is better to wait to accumulate 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.419
 one-time opening 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.789
 since January school teeth or do the dishes 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.539
 the gym falls to the sidewalk and when it was now hovel silva advancing 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.860
 other than India 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 then for me it will be much more water 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.580
 so we concluded that it is necessary to preserve water because it is one of the largest 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.489
 goods that nature can offer us
