up<00:02:34.740> with<00:02:34.860> 325<00:02:35.720> I've<00:02:36.720> been<00:02:36.870> hitting<00:02:37.080> 325

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
up with 325 I've been hitting 325

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.950 
up with 325 I've been hitting 325
consistently<00:02:38.400> now<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:38.880> easily<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
consistently now really easily so I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.540 
consistently now really easily so I
think<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.560> should<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.800> comfortable<00:02:41.190> with<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
think I should be comfortable with that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.480 
think I should be comfortable with that
weight<00:02:41.760> even<00:02:42.060> after<00:02:42.470> attempting<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.680> max<00:02:44.010> squat

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
weight even after attempting a max squat

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.860 
weight even after attempting a max squat
so<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.500> pretty<00:02:47.460> much

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
so that's that and pretty much

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.970 
so that's that and pretty much
everything<00:02:48.870> else<00:02:49.080> has<00:02:49.170> been<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:49.740> I'll
