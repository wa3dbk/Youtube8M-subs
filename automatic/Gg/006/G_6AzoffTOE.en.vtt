it<00:05:44.420> because<00:05:44.660> it's<00:05:44.810> worth<00:05:45.230> having<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:46.930> it's<00:05:47.930> I

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
it because it's worth having and it's I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.600 
it because it's worth having and it's I
think<00:05:48.290> it's<00:05:48.530> a<00:05:48.560> really<00:05:48.710> great<00:05:48.920> product<00:05:49.160> it's

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.270 
think it's a really great product it's
smaller<00:05:50.120> than<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.540> should<00:05:50.960> be<00:05:51.170> and<00:05:51.440> so<00:05:51.470> it

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
smaller than it should be and so it

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.280 
smaller than it should be and so it
doesn't<00:05:52.580> feel<00:05:52.850> right<00:05:53.090> when<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.420> hold<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.780> it's
