00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
you my version one sound card this is a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.250 
you my version one sound card this is a
my<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.570> version<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.770> sound<00:00:17.369> card<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
my first version of a sound card for a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.700 
my first version of a sound card for a
micro<00:00:19.260> CPU<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:22.050> no<00:00:22.470> any<00:00:22.680> optimized<00:00:24.230> it<00:00:25.230> can

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
micro CPU it's no any optimized it can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
micro CPU it's no any optimized it can
run<00:00:26.099> Joule<00:00:26.849> notes<00:00:28.699> it's<00:00:29.699> only<00:00:30.000> eight<00:00:30.330> notes

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
run Joule notes it's only eight notes

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
run Joule notes it's only eight notes
though<00:00:31.040> for<00:00:32.040> each<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.340> them<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:33.890> like

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
though for each of them going from like

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.110 
though for each of them going from like
middle<00:00:35.640> C<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.149> high<00:00:36.750> C<00:00:37.520> no<00:00:38.520> sharps<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.090> flats

middle C to high C no sharps or flats

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.250 
middle C to high C no sharps or flats
just<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> standard<00:00:40.350> notes<00:00:41.239> as<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.140> see

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
just the standard notes as you can see

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
just the standard notes as you can see
here<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:45.350> memory<00:00:46.850> it's<00:00:47.850> rather

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
here this is the memory it's rather

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.250 
here this is the memory it's rather
large<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:50.120> sixteen<00:00:51.120> bytes<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
large it's sixteen bytes I think so that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.150 
large it's sixteen bytes I think so that
allows<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> play<00:00:53.059> sixteen<00:00:54.059> notes<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
allows you to play sixteen notes in a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
allows you to play sixteen notes in a
song<00:00:56.539> that's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.870> including<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> doubled-up

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
song that's not including the doubled-up

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
song that's not including the doubled-up
notes<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> memory<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> got<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:03.739> shrug<00:01:04.739> its

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
notes this memory I got from shrug its

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.340 
notes this memory I got from shrug its
his<00:01:06.140> ultra<00:01:07.140> fast<00:01:07.530> memory<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.310> something<00:01:09.350> this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
his ultra fast memory or something this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
his ultra fast memory or something this
counter<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.720> got<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.960> from<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> another

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
counter I got that from so another

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
counter I got that from so another
redstone<00:01:17.070> thing<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> downloaded<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.390> cut

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
redstone thing I downloaded I just cut

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
redstone thing I downloaded I just cut
that<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.780> using<00:01:19.020> mcedit<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> there

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that out using mcedit and put it there

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.010 
that out using mcedit and put it there
and<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> sound<00:01:23.700> card<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and then this is the sound card so the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.710 
and then this is the sound card so the
way<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.290> runs<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> yellow<00:01:26.939> bit<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
way it runs is the yellow bit here is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
way it runs is the yellow bit here is
the<00:01:28.080> clock<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.119> it'll<00:01:30.119> send<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> pulse<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the clock and it'll send a pulse to the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.219 
the clock and it'll send a pulse to the
note<00:01:32.579> blocks<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> play<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> note<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.110> will

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
note blocks to play the note and it will

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.380 
note blocks to play the note and it will
also<00:01:34.380> send<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> pulse<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> incrementer<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
also send a pulse to the incrementer to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.719 
also send a pulse to the incrementer to
go<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> next<00:01:36.900> note<00:01:39.049> right<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.290> I've

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
go to the next note right now I've

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
go to the next note right now I've
almost<00:01:41.729> finished<00:01:42.119> programming<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
almost finished programming I'm just

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
almost finished programming I'm just
going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.790> note<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
going to put in one more note and then I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.530 
going to put in one more note and then I
can<00:01:46.259> save<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:48.000> test<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:50.540> I've

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
can save it and we can test it so I've

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
can save it and we can test it so I've
pretty<00:01:52.350> much<00:01:52.640> what<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:56.000> it's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
pretty much what it is is it's it's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.590 
pretty much what it is is it's it's
inverted<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.740> built<00:01:59.090> it<00:02:00.090> will

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
inverted just the way it's built it will

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.050 
inverted just the way it's built it will
be<00:02:00.719> fixed<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> final<00:02:02.189> version<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.880> for

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
be fixed in the final version but for

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.530 
be fixed in the final version but for
now<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:04.049> inverted<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.549> would<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
now it's inverted so this would be the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.609 
now it's inverted so this would be the
middle<00:02:07.350> C<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.479> need<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.349> need<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
middle C so what we need is we need to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.720 
middle C so what we need is we need to
play

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
play

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.350 
play
a<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.640> flip<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.580> would<00:02:17.879> play

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
a so we flip this on and that would play

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.750 
a so we flip this on and that would play
us<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.470> e<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.819> want<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.280> basically

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
us the e that we want then it basically

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.380 
us the e that we want then it basically
that's<00:02:27.510> those<00:02:28.290> three<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.860> eight<00:02:29.069> notes

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that's those three for the eight notes

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.390 
that's those three for the eight notes
this<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.989> for<00:02:31.379> whether<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.709> want<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> bass

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this one is for whether we want it bass

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.309 
this one is for whether we want it bass
or<00:02:32.900> piano<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> keep<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.549> as<00:02:35.670> piano

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
or piano so we want to keep it as piano

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.100 
or piano so we want to keep it as piano
the<00:02:37.319> next<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.950> want<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> bass<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the next one we want to be bass and this

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.369 
the next one we want to be bass and this
one<00:02:40.410> well<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.030> first<00:02:42.659> bit<00:02:42.930> least

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
one well this is the first bit least

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.130 
one well this is the first bit least
significant<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.900> this

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
significant bit this is the two and this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.580 
significant bit this is the two and this
is<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.549> four<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.720> only<00:02:49.110> reason<00:02:49.379> it's<00:02:49.530> like

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
is the four the only reason it's like

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.110 
is the four the only reason it's like
that<00:02:49.829> is<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:50.549> been<00:02:50.790> swapped

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that is because that's been swapped

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.229 
that is because that's been swapped
around<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.250> didn't<00:02:53.250> leave<00:02:53.609> enough<00:02:53.849> room<00:02:54.209> to

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
around and I didn't leave enough room to

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.500 
around and I didn't leave enough room to
switch<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.109> wires<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.430> pretty<00:02:57.060> much<00:02:57.239> all<00:02:57.480> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
switch the wires so pretty much all I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
switch the wires so pretty much all I
have<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.840> do<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.230> leave<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.739> how<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
have to do is leave that how it is and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.780 
have to do is leave that how it is and
now<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:00.690> will<00:03:01.079> have<00:03:01.290> an<00:03:01.470> e<00:03:01.829> with<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.549> bass<00:03:02.760> drum

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
now we will have an e with the bass drum

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.410 
now we will have an e with the bass drum
and<00:03:03.349> an<00:03:04.349> e<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.430> piano<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:07.109> we<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.379> over<00:03:07.410> here

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and an e in the piano so we go over here

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.520 
and an e in the piano so we go over here
if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.540> press<00:03:09.780> save<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.930> could<00:03:13.079> hear

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
if you press save as you could hear

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.860 
if you press save as you could hear
there<00:03:13.859> was<00:03:13.950> some<00:03:14.099> Pistons<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.609> moved<00:03:14.910> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
there was some Pistons that moved that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.319 
there was some Pistons that moved that
basically<00:03:16.470> means<00:03:16.889> that<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:19.340> drums<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.669> mean

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
basically means that the drums I mean

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.259 
basically means that the drums I mean
the<00:03:21.540> bass<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> piano<00:03:22.200> were<00:03:23.099> changing<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.120> if

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the bass and piano were changing so if

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.870 
the bass and piano were changing so if
we<00:03:24.419> just<00:03:24.660> disconnect<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.290> quickly<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.760> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
we just disconnect that quickly so it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.979 
we just disconnect that quickly so it
doesn't<00:03:27.120> increment<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.810> press<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
doesn't increment we can press the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.309 
doesn't increment we can press the
button<00:03:29.389> right<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:30.599> they're<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> two<00:03:31.049> notes

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
button right so they're the two notes

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.000 
button right so they're the two notes
there<00:03:31.650> when<00:03:31.859> we<00:03:31.980> press<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> button<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.769> can

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
there when we press the button so we can

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.210 
there when we press the button so we can
go<00:03:35.340> ahead<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:36.380> put<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> redstone<00:03:37.620> wire<00:03:37.950> back

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
go ahead and put the redstone wire back

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.270 
go ahead and put the redstone wire back
and<00:03:39.079> we<00:03:40.079> shall<00:03:40.769> be<00:03:40.980> ready<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.459> run<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.620> let's<00:03:43.980> go

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
and we shall be ready to run so let's go

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.809 
and we shall be ready to run so let's go
down<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.790> press<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.799> reset<00:03:46.799> as<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.730> see

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
down and press the reset as you can see

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.390 
down and press the reset as you can see
they<00:03:48.000> all<00:03:48.150> go<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.389> zero<00:03:49.790> run<00:03:50.790> over<00:03:51.030> here<00:03:52.400> flick

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
they all go to zero run over here flick

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.210 
they all go to zero run over here flick
the<00:03:53.519> switch<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.560> there's<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.769> first<00:03:55.950> note

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
the switch and there's the first note

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.979 
the switch and there's the first note
now<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.109> it's<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.849> decent<00:04:00.389> speed<00:04:00.720> I

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
now it's a it's it's a decent speed I

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.869 
now it's a it's it's a decent speed I
wouldn't<00:04:01.290> say<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.620> fast<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> wouldn't

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
wouldn't say it's fast but I wouldn't

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.640 
wouldn't say it's fast but I wouldn't
say<00:04:03.090> it's<00:04:03.239> slow<00:04:05.419> again<00:04:06.419> as<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.989> said<00:04:07.049> it's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
say it's slow again as I said it's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.599 
say it's slow again as I said it's
nowhere<00:04:07.980> near<00:04:08.190> optimized<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:10.500> as<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.519> can

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
nowhere near optimized and as you can

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.979 
nowhere near optimized and as you can
hear<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:11.910> notes<00:04:12.150> are<00:04:12.329> playing<00:04:12.569> now<00:04:12.780> and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
hear the notes are playing now and

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.310 
hear the notes are playing now and
they're<00:04:13.650> changing<00:04:14.069> you've<00:04:14.730> got<00:04:14.970> drums<00:04:15.840> and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
they're changing you've got drums and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.009 
they're changing you've got drums and
piano<00:04:18.320> basically<00:04:19.549> what<00:04:20.549> happens<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
piano basically what happens is the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.560 
piano basically what happens is the
three

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
three

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.680 
three
outputs<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> notes<00:04:25.300> go<00:04:26.300> into<00:04:26.540> this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
outputs for the notes go into this

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.950 
outputs for the notes go into this
decoder<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:28.150> if<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.450> decoder<00:04:30.820> has<00:04:31.820> when<00:04:32.810> it

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
decoder and if the decoder has when it

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.480 
decoder and if the decoder has when it
gets<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.590> right<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:33.890> from<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> decoder

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
gets the right one from the decoder

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.440 
gets the right one from the decoder
it'll<00:04:35.360> set<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.750> low<00:04:35.990> right<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:37.730> then<00:04:38.090> when<00:04:38.300> this

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
it'll set up low right so then when this

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.040 
it'll set up low right so then when this
inverts<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:39.140> it<00:04:39.830> sets<00:04:40.220> them<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.180> low<00:04:41.810> down

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
inverts it it sets them to low down

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.040 
inverts it it sets them to low down
there<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.460> will<00:04:43.610> set<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.850> one<00:04:44.780> that's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
there and it will set the one that's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.620 
there and it will set the one that's
meant<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.320> be<00:04:45.640> played<00:04:46.640> hi

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
meant to be played hi

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.450 
meant to be played hi
as<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.930> just<00:04:47.960> saw<00:04:48.320> there<00:04:48.820> now<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.570> bit<00:04:50.840> here

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
as you just saw there now this bit here

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.910 
as you just saw there now this bit here
will<00:04:52.460> set<00:04:52.850> them<00:04:53.000> all<00:04:53.240> high<00:04:53.510> so<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.380> none<00:04:54.800> of

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
will set them all high so that none of

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.530 
will set them all high so that none of
them<00:04:55.100> will<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.460> played<00:04:55.850> when<00:04:56.210> there's<00:04:56.420> any

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
them will be played when there's any

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.160 
them will be played when there's any
switchover<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.500> memory<00:04:57.950> or<00:04:58.390> when<00:04:59.390> it's<00:04:59.930> not

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
switchover in memory or when it's not

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.080 
switchover in memory or when it's not
meant<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.440> be<00:05:00.560> played<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.490> when<00:05:01.640> it<00:05:01.760> receives

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
meant to be played and when it receives

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.830 
meant to be played and when it receives
the<00:05:02.270> pulse

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
the pulse

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.070 
the pulse
they<00:05:03.140> flash<00:05:03.620> off<00:05:04.060> just<00:05:05.060> allowing<00:05:05.570> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
they flash off just allowing the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.160 
they flash off just allowing the
selected<00:05:06.920> note<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.370> flash<00:05:07.790> off<00:05:08.030> allowing<00:05:08.810> that

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
selected note to flash off allowing that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.430 
selected note to flash off allowing that
to<00:05:09.380> turn<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.310> play<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.670> note<00:05:11.440> this

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
to turn on and play the note this

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.950 
to turn on and play the note this
happens<00:05:12.860> on<00:05:12.980> both<00:05:13.190> sides<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.820> then<00:05:14.510> when<00:05:14.840> we

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
happens on both sides and then when we

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.140 
happens on both sides and then when we
go<00:05:15.140> down<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:17.180> orange<00:05:17.750> wire<00:05:18.170> pretty<00:05:18.770> much

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
when there's wood so that's all I did to

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.690 
when there's wood so that's all I did to

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
those two at the end are probably just

would<00:05:54.260> be<00:05:54.290> that<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.940> would<00:05:56.030> write<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.270> program

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
would be that you would write a program

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.440 
would be that you would write a program
and<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.290> program<00:05:57.640> would<00:05:58.640> tell<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.120> computer

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
and the program would tell the computer

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.380 
and the program would tell the computer
to<00:06:00.070> write<00:06:01.070> to<00:06:01.610> put<00:06:01.850> all<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:03.140> notes<00:06:04.090> stored<00:06:05.090> in

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
it'll probably have more memory as well

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.710 
it'll probably have more memory as well
maybe<00:06:51.290> like<00:06:52.290> eight<00:06:52.830> bits<00:06:53.130> no<00:06:54.000> eight<00:06:54.360> eight

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
maybe like eight bits no eight eight

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.560 
maybe like eight bits no eight eight
address<00:06:55.200> bits<00:06:55.440> of<00:06:55.620> memory<00:06:55.920> so<00:06:56.730> that<00:06:56.760> then<00:06:57.120> all

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
address bits of memory so that then all

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.940 
address bits of memory so that then all
you<00:06:58.410> will<00:06:58.650> have<00:06:58.830> to<00:06:58.980> do<00:06:59.130> is<00:07:00.590> start<00:07:01.590> it<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:01.890> you

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
you will have to do is start it and you

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.590 
you will have to do is start it and you
will<00:07:02.700> then<00:07:02.880> have<00:07:04.220> 255<00:07:05.220> notes<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:06.180> will<00:07:06.330> need

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
will then have 255 notes that will need

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.540 
will then have 255 notes that will need
to<00:07:06.660> be<00:07:06.780> played<00:07:08.000> actually<00:07:10.040> 255<00:07:11.040> is<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.220> bit<00:07:11.400> much

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
to be played actually 255 is a bit much

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
to be played actually 255 is a bit much
I<00:07:11.910> will<00:07:12.390> well<00:07:12.800> 256<00:07:13.800> I'll<00:07:14.580> probably<00:07:14.850> only<00:07:15.120> make

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
I will well 256 I'll probably only make

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.030 
I will well 256 I'll probably only make
it<00:07:15.600> maybe<00:07:16.790> six<00:07:17.790> bits<00:07:18.290> for<00:07:19.290> the<00:07:19.380> address<00:07:19.680> or

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 
it maybe six bits for the address or

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.540 
it maybe six bits for the address or
something<00:07:20.660> because<00:07:21.660> you<00:07:22.290> want<00:07:22.680> more<00:07:22.860> than<00:07:23.040> 16

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
something because you want more than 16

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.600 
something because you want more than 16
but<00:07:23.850> not<00:07:24.000> too<00:07:24.210> much<00:07:24.500> maybe<00:07:25.500> even<00:07:26.130> just<00:07:26.340> five

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
but not too much maybe even just five

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.060 
but not too much maybe even just five
bits<00:07:26.910> so<00:07:27.180> that<00:07:27.210> it's<00:07:27.510> 32<00:07:27.990> and<00:07:28.230> I'll<00:07:28.860> just

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070 
bits so that it's 32 and I'll just

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.720 
bits so that it's 32 and I'll just
extend<00:07:29.340> that<00:07:29.610> over<00:07:29.850> one<00:07:31.130> so<00:07:32.130> yeah<00:07:32.280> that's

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
extend that over one so yeah that's

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.080 
extend that over one so yeah that's
about<00:07:32.940> it<00:07:33.090> for<00:07:33.540> my<00:07:34.190> resonant<00:07:35.190> sound<00:07:35.340> card<00:07:35.640> hope
