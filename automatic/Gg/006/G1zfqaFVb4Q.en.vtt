actually our little crew now thing is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.340 
actually our little crew now thing is
what<00:02:36.040> does<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.580> mean<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.930> fact<00:02:38.230> that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
what does this really mean the fact that

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.490 
what does this really mean the fact that
the<00:02:38.560> ancients<00:02:39.100> built<00:02:39.250> statues<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.180> our<00:02:40.630> crew

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the ancients built statues of our crew

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.030 
the ancients built statues of our crew
yes<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.090> game<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:45.010> have

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
yes this is all just a game and you have

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.760 
yes this is all just a game and you have
to<00:02:45.340> think<00:02:45.850> about<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.360> too<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.560> all

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
to think about that too like this is all

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.080 
to think about that too like this is all
just<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.100> game<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.550> that's<00:02:48.670> sort<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.970> almost

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
just the game so that's sort of almost

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.810 
just the game so that's sort of almost
discredits<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.650> part<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.100> storyline<00:02:51.640> in

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
discredits this part of the storyline in

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.820 
discredits this part of the storyline in
one<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.209> my<00:02:52.330> theories<00:02:52.690> or<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.170> discredits<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
one of my theories or it discredits the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.920 
one of my theories or it discredits the
entire<00:02:54.100> storyline<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.510> whole<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.280> really

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
entire storyline as a whole but really

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.320 
entire storyline as a whole but really
if<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.230> ancients<00:02:59.860> built<00:03:00.130> these<00:03:00.520> statues<00:03:01.120> of

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
if the ancients built these statues of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.030 
if the ancients built these statues of
the<00:03:01.480> characters<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.500> seems<00:03:02.800> like

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
the characters that just seems like

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.140 
the characters that just seems like
whole<00:03:04.080> mind-blowing<00:03:05.160> storyline<00:03:06.160> information

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
whole mind-blowing storyline information

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.960 
whole mind-blowing storyline information
if<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.360> know<00:03:07.510> what<00:03:07.600> I'm<00:03:07.690> saying<00:03:08.049> like<00:03:08.290> if<00:03:08.970> if

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
if you know what I'm saying like if if

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.120 
if you know what I'm saying like if if
the<00:03:10.239> ancients<00:03:10.660> knew<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.200> they<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.769> these
