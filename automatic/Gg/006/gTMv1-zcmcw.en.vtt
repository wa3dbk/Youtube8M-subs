you<00:01:08.970> can't<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.950> banggood<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you can't get that on banggood I had to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
you can't get that on banggood I had to
go<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:13.200> eBay<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.970> this<00:01:14.970> particular

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
go on the on eBay to get this particular
one<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.960> can't<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> thicker

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
one because you can't get the thicker

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
one because you can't get the thicker
coax<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:19.229> banggood<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> form<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.080> RP

board<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.490> getting<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.030> one

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
board now just getting back to this one

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.930 
board now just getting back to this one
here<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.570> one<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.080> moose<00:02:22.940> doesn't

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
here this is one you have moose doesn't

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.750 
here this is one you have moose doesn't
matter<00:02:24.090> which<00:02:24.210> one<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.600> purchase<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.950> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
matter which one your purchase of that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.710 
matter which one your purchase of that
RP<00:02:27.270> SMA<00:02:28.170> female<00:02:28.970> you'll<00:02:29.970> still<00:02:30.240> have<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> cut

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
RP SMA female you'll still have to cut

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.500 
RP SMA female you'll still have to cut
the<00:02:30.840> other<00:02:30.960> end<00:02:31.080> off<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:32.300> because<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.450> not

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the other end off it because you're not

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.450 
the other end off it because you're not
going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.590> need<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.950> separate

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
going to use it and you need to separate

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.240 
going to use it and you need to separate
the<00:02:36.300> internal<00:02:37.170> conductor<00:02:38.010> from<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.990> shield

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the internal conductor from the shield

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790 
the internal conductor from the shield
so<00:02:41.250> ya<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.210> picture<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.690> shows<00:02:42.990> your<00:02:43.260> one

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so ya this picture here shows your one

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
so ya this picture here shows your one
that<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> another<00:02:44.460> lead<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.090> I've<00:02:45.180> got<00:02:45.390> which

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that of another lead that I've got which

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.200 
that of another lead that I've got which
is<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.260> same<00:02:46.470> thickness<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.980> coax<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
is the same thickness of coax and you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.570 
is the same thickness of coax and you
can<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.750> there's<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.020> center<00:02:49.350> conductor

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
can see here there's a center conductor

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.300 
can see here there's a center conductor
and<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.390> other<00:02:51.480> side<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.530> braid

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and on the other side here is the braid

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.850 
and on the other side here is the braid
the<00:02:53.670> shield<00:02:54.030> which<00:02:54.720> obviously<00:02:55.230> connects<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
the shield which obviously connects to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.810 
the shield which obviously connects to
that<00:02:55.890> circuit<00:02:56.370> board<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.920> say<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.610> you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that circuit board so as I say if you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.040 
that circuit board so as I say if you
want<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> thicker<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.480> you'll<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.930> go

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
want the thicker one you'll have to go

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.400 
want the thicker one you'll have to go
on<00:03:01.170> eBay<00:03:01.470> cause<00:03:01.710> bangle<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.700> and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
on eBay cause bangle don't have it and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
on eBay cause bangle don't have it and
I'll<00:03:04.410> repeating<00:03:04.890> myself<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.240> want

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
I'll repeating myself but you just want

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.290 
I'll repeating myself but you just want
to<00:03:06.450> make<00:03:06.570> sure<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.780> get<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:06.990> right<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
to make sure I get it right it's a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.500 
to make sure I get it right it's a
thicker<00:03:09.510> coax<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.200> RP<00:03:10.770> SMA<00:03:11.520> female<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
thicker coax and it's RP SMA female and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.010 
thicker coax and it's RP SMA female and
this<00:03:13.440> one<00:03:13.650> here<00:03:13.860> was<00:03:13.890> about<00:03:14.300> 10<00:03:15.300> centimeters<00:03:15.990> I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
this one here was about 10 centimeters I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
this one here was about 10 centimeters I
think<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.830> I've<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.430> cut<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.790> short

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
think it was and I've just cut it short

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.670 
think it was and I've just cut it short
the<00:03:18.240> length<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> cable<00:03:19.080> doesn't<00:03:19.530> really

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the length of the cable doesn't really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.850 
the length of the cable doesn't really
matter<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.220> much<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.440> kept<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> little

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
matter that much so I just kept a little

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.960 
matter that much so I just kept a little
bit<00:03:22.950> short<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> could<00:03:23.550> leave<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.850> bit

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
bit short but you could leave it a bit

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.850 
bit short but you could leave it a bit
longer<00:03:24.209> if<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.390> wanted<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:24.959> whatever<00:03:25.620> one

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
longer if you wanted to but whatever one

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.110 
longer if you wanted to but whatever one
you<00:03:25.980> buy<00:03:26.190> make<00:03:27.120> sure<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.810> your<00:03:27.959> SMA

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
you buy make sure it's just got your SMA

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.420 
you buy make sure it's just got your SMA
RP<00:03:30.120> SMA<00:03:30.540> connector<00:03:31.050> on<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.200> end<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:32.130> doesn't

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
RP SMA connector on one end and doesn't

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.290 
RP SMA connector on one end and doesn't
matter<00:03:32.550> what's<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> other<00:03:32.970> end<00:03:33.120> you're

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
matter what's on the other end you're

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.810 
matter what's on the other end you're
gonna<00:03:33.420> cut<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.750> off<00:03:33.780> anyway<00:03:34.170> because<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:35.640> need

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
gonna cut it off anyway because you need

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.240 
gonna cut it off anyway because you need
to<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.900> split<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.320> solder<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.920> circuit

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
to just split the solder on the circuit

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.420 
to just split the solder on the circuit
board<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.870> hope<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.650> clear<00:03:40.860> enough<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.310> you

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
board I hope that's clear enough for you

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.960 
board I hope that's clear enough for you
now<00:03:42.330> I'll<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.780> remove<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:44.340> one<00:03:44.550> here<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
now I'll just remove this one here for a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
now I'll just remove this one here for a
second<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:47.690> just<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.250> sake<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:52.040> being

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
second and just for the sake of it being

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.550 
second and just for the sake of it being
good<00:03:53.310> call<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:55.490> connectors<00:03:56.630> would<00:03:57.630> they<00:03:58.350> call

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
good call the connectors would they call

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.420 
good call the connectors would they call
it<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.860> an<00:03:59.100> SMA<00:04:00.290> connection<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:02.010> call<00:04:02.280> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
it a an SMA connection and they call it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.630 
it a an SMA connection and they call it
with<00:04:02.550> an<00:04:02.700> inner<00:04:03.060> needle<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.430> with

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
inner hole that's the way that bank

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.850 
inner hole that's the way that bank
would<00:04:10.320> describe<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.890> connector<00:04:11.450> now<00:04:12.680> as<00:04:13.680> you

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
would describe the connector now as you

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.699 
would describe the connector now as you
can<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.130> here<00:04:14.310> I've<00:04:14.400> used<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.500> old

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
can see here I've used the the old

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.440 
can see here I've used the the old
fitting<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.190> connects<00:04:17.790> into<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.090> top<00:04:18.299> here

now in the previous video you saw this
in<00:04:22.979> three<00:04:23.490> separate<00:04:23.850> two<00:04:24.300> separate<00:04:24.660> three

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
in three separate two separate three

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.309 
in three separate two separate three
separate<00:04:25.319> pieces<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:26.780> before<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.960> cut<00:04:28.229> it

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
separate pieces actually before I cut it

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.409 
separate pieces actually before I cut it
off<00:04:28.439> as<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.830> top<00:04:29.189> section<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:29.819> which<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.389> just

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
off as a top section here which is just

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.129 
off as a top section here which is just
there<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.400> get<00:04:32.400> my<00:04:32.550> penknife<00:04:32.909> there<00:04:33.719> that<00:04:33.870> piece

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
there I get my penknife there that piece

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.350 
there I get my penknife there that piece
there<00:04:34.409> which<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.770> glued<00:04:35.069> in<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.120> section

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
there which is glued in to this section

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.320 
there which is glued in to this section
here<00:04:36.689> now<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.979> get<00:04:38.099> the<00:04:38.250> SMA<00:04:38.639> connector<00:04:39.090> up

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
here now to get the SMA connector up

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.890 
here now to get the SMA connector up
through<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:40.199> at<00:04:41.009> least<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.819> far<00:04:42.090> you'll

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
through there at least this far you'll

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.740 
through there at least this far you'll
need<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.259> run<00:04:43.439> a<00:04:43.710> 10<00:04:44.310> millimeter<00:04:44.610> drill<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.509> the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
need to run a 10 millimeter drill so the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.200 
need to run a 10 millimeter drill so the
nut<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.409> fit<00:04:46.590> up<00:04:46.740> through<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.039> hole<00:04:47.219> now<00:04:48.000> when

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
nut can fit up through the hole now when

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.580 
nut can fit up through the hole now when
you<00:04:48.330> get<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.479> this<00:04:48.659> section<00:04:48.900> here<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:49.439> little

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
you get to this section here this little

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.309 
you get to this section here this little
top<00:04:50.069> section<00:04:50.550> where<00:04:51.449> I've<00:04:51.569> cut<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.960> aerial

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
top section where I've cut the aerial

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.339 
top section where I've cut the aerial
off<00:04:52.879> don't<00:04:53.879> run<00:04:54.479> your<00:04:54.599> ten<00:04:54.810> mil<00:04:54.990> drill<00:04:55.229> up

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
off don't run your ten mil drill up

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.420 
off don't run your ten mil drill up
through<00:04:55.500> there<00:04:55.680> because<00:04:55.919> then<00:04:56.189> that<00:04:56.340> will

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
through there because then that will

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.640 
through there because then that will
just<00:04:56.639> go<00:04:56.759> straight<00:04:57.090> through<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.629> this<00:04:58.409> top

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
just go straight through so this top

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.309 
just go straight through so this top
section<00:04:59.009> here<00:04:59.039> before<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.550> glue<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.879> in<00:05:00.319> just

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
section here before you glue it in just

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.309 
section here before you glue it in just
drill<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.620> seven<00:05:02.099> mil<00:05:02.310> hole<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.780> SMA

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
drill a seven mil hole and the SMA

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.629 
drill a seven mil hole and the SMA
connector<00:05:04.349> will<00:05:04.830> fit<00:05:05.039> up<00:05:05.159> through<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.610> the

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
connector will fit up through the the

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.309 
connector will fit up through the the
guts<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.360> because<00:05:06.719> you've<00:05:06.840> draw<00:05:07.050> about

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
guts of this because you've draw about

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.950 
guts of this because you've draw about
ten<00:05:07.620> mil<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.129> then<00:05:08.909> it'll<00:05:09.060> slide<00:05:09.479> up<00:05:09.659> through

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
ten mil and then it'll slide up through

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.550 
ten mil and then it'll slide up through
the<00:05:10.110> seven<00:05:10.530> mil<00:05:10.830> hole<00:05:11.069> here<00:05:11.400> 6.47<00:05:12.330> mil<00:05:12.659> so<00:05:13.349> the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
the seven mil hole here 6.47 mil so the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.999 
the seven mil hole here 6.47 mil so the
SMA<00:05:14.180> can<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.330> screwed<00:05:16.259> to<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.529> top<00:05:16.740> here<00:05:16.919> I

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
SMA can be screwed to the top here I

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.769 
SMA can be screwed to the top here I
hope<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.940> can<00:05:18.060> understand<00:05:18.479> that<00:05:18.629> okay<00:05:19.669> now

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
hope you can understand that okay now

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.080 
hope you can understand that okay now
another<00:05:21.779> way<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:22.169> can<00:05:22.409> do<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:23.000> in<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
another way you can do it is in the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.360 
another way you can do it is in the
previous<00:05:24.300> video<00:05:24.659> I<00:05:24.750> showed<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.439> can<00:05:26.069> just<00:05:26.250> get

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
previous video I showed you can just get

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.600 
previous video I showed you can just get
yourself<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:27.029> disc<00:05:27.449> like<00:05:28.349> that<00:05:29.419> and<00:05:30.469> originally

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
yourself a disc like that and originally

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.550 
yourself a disc like that and originally
if<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.849> can<00:05:33.000> just<00:05:33.150> see<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:33.449> this<00:05:33.960> was<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.199> disc

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
if I can just see that this was a disc

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.390 
if I can just see that this was a disc
when<00:05:35.159> I<00:05:35.190> purchased<00:05:35.699> it<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:35.879> just<00:05:36.060> went<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.360> a

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
when I purchased it I just went to a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.529 
when I purchased it I just went to a
perspex<00:05:38.400> dealer<00:05:38.759> and<00:05:38.849> asked<00:05:39.029> him<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.210> cut<00:05:39.419> me

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
perspex dealer and asked him to cut me

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.040 
perspex dealer and asked him to cut me
out<00:05:39.569> of<00:05:39.659> 30<00:05:39.960> mil<00:05:40.199> disc<00:05:41.069> now<00:05:42.000> obviously<00:05:42.810> when<00:05:43.020> he

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
out of 30 mil disc now obviously when he

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.950 
out of 30 mil disc now obviously when he
cuts<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.379> 30<00:05:43.589> mil<00:05:43.860> out<00:05:44.029> the<00:05:45.029> disc<00:05:45.330> diameter

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
cuts the 30 mil out the disc diameter

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.110 
cuts the 30 mil out the disc diameter
across<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.919> Arizona<00:05:47.099> gonna<00:05:47.430> be<00:05:47.550> about<00:05:47.699> 29

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
across the Arizona gonna be about 29

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.760 
across the Arizona gonna be about 29
which<00:05:48.479> is<00:05:48.509> fair<00:05:48.839> enough<00:05:48.990> but<00:05:49.139> it'll<00:05:49.409> still<00:05:49.620> fit

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
which is fair enough but it'll still fit

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.070 
which is fair enough but it'll still fit
in<00:05:49.919> there<00:05:50.069> with<00:05:50.819> a<00:05:50.849> bit<00:05:51.029> of<00:05:51.150> modification<00:05:51.360> so

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
in there with a bit of modification so

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.140 
in there with a bit of modification so
this<00:05:53.039> is<00:05:53.159> an<00:05:53.250> easy<00:05:53.430> way<00:05:53.639> to<00:05:53.669> do<00:05:53.940> it<00:05:54.029> you<00:05:54.120> just

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
this is an easy way to do it you just

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.459 
this is an easy way to do it you just
drilled<00:05:54.449> a<00:05:54.509> six<00:05:54.719> and<00:05:54.779> a<00:05:54.839> half<00:05:54.900> or<00:05:55.110> seven<00:05:55.259> mil

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
drilled a six and a half or seven mil

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.999 
drilled a six and a half or seven mil
hole<00:05:55.650> through<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.039> center<00:05:56.219> and<00:05:57.060> put<00:05:57.509> your

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
hole through the center and put your

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.409 
hole through the center and put your
connector<00:05:59.009> through<00:05:59.159> it<00:05:59.310> doesn't<00:06:00.120> matter<00:06:00.270> what

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
connector through it doesn't matter what

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.290 
connector through it doesn't matter what
coax<00:06:00.779> it<00:06:00.900> is<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:02.370> all<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.669> do<00:06:02.819> is<00:06:02.849> just<00:06:03.120> go<00:06:03.270> to

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
coax it is and all you do is just go to

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.119 
coax it is and all you do is just go to
your<00:06:03.509> bench<00:06:03.690> grinder<00:06:04.229> and<00:06:04.409> just<00:06:04.440> put<00:06:05.099> a

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
your bench grinder and just put a

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.469 
your bench grinder and just put a
chamfer<00:06:05.460> you'll<00:06:05.729> need<00:06:05.879> to<00:06:06.000> make<00:06:06.180> this<00:06:06.300> the

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
chamfer you'll need to make this the

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.829 
chamfer you'll need to make this the
same<00:06:06.690> shape<00:06:07.080> as<00:06:07.379> this<00:06:07.560> original<00:06:08.190> part<00:06:08.839> but

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
same shape as this original part but

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.769 
same shape as this original part but
just<00:06:09.900> chamfer<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.620> around<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.009> edges<00:06:11.779> there

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
just chamfer it around the edges there

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.159 
just chamfer it around the edges there
and<00:06:13.080> I'll<00:06:13.919> just<00:06:14.479> excuse<00:06:15.479> my<00:06:15.599> airfare<00:06:15.930> I'll

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
and I'll just excuse my airfare I'll
