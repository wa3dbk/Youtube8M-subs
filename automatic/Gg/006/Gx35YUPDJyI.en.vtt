00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
side Christians and Muslims there is a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.550 
side Christians and Muslims there is a
unity<00:02:42.910> there<00:02:43.120> against<00:02:43.510> Morsi<00:02:43.750> against<00:02:44.470> the

Muslim Brotherhood against my client and
that's<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> things<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.650> I'm

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
that's one of the things that I'm

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.430 
that's one of the things that I'm
wondering<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.460> if<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.360> violence<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
wondering here if in this violence and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.160 
wondering here if in this violence and
this<00:02:50.730> devastation<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.150> family<00:02:52.570> there

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
this devastation for this family there

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.200 
this devastation for this family there
might<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.650> kernel<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.610> something<00:02:54.670> that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
might be a kernel of something that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.750 
might be a kernel of something that
brings<00:02:55.540> together<00:02:56.100> Muslims<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.340> Christians

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
brings together Muslims and Christians

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.210 
brings together Muslims and Christians
who<00:02:58.210> want<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.720> live<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.590> democratic

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
who want to live in a democratic

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220 
who want to live in a democratic
environment<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.880> Egypt<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.450> perhaps<00:03:01.720> this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
environment in Egypt and perhaps this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.470 
environment in Egypt and perhaps this
girl's<00:03:02.530> death<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.130> some<00:03:03.760> way<00:03:03.910> down<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.300> road

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
girl's death in some way down the road

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.450 
girl's death in some way down the road
inspires<00:03:04.930> them<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.380> get<00:03:05.530> together<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.340> it's

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
inspires them to get together and it's

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.730 
inspires them to get together and it's
extremely<00:03:07.420> symbolic<00:03:08.050> in<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.320> way<00:03:08.470> there's<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
extremely symbolic in that way there's a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.680 
extremely symbolic in that way there's a
one-to-one<00:03:09.040> correlation<00:03:09.670> across<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.450> region

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
one-to-one correlation across the region

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.760 
one-to-one correlation across the region
and<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:10.870> let's<00:03:11.140> look<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> broader

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
and again let's look at the broader

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.670 
and again let's look at the broader
picture<00:03:12.070> here<00:03:12.610> where<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.380> see<00:03:14.560> an

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
picture here where as you see an

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.350 
picture here where as you see an
increase<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.430> radicalism<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.240> extremism

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
increase in the radicalism and extremism

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600 
increase in the radicalism and extremism
and<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.320> those<00:03:17.500> influences<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.370> see<00:03:18.550> an

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and in those influences you see an

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.550 
and in those influences you see an
increase<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.060> Christian<00:03:19.570> persecution<00:03:19.989> that's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
increase in Christian persecution that's

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.900 
increase in Christian persecution that's
across<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.890> board<00:03:21.040> we're<00:03:21.310> seeing<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.640> in<00:03:21.730> so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
across the board we're seeing that in so

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.210 
across the board we're seeing that in so
many<00:03:21.940> middle<00:03:22.450> eastern<00:03:22.720> countries<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.860> in

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
many middle eastern countries and in

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.350 
many middle eastern countries and in
North<00:03:24.430> Africa<00:03:24.610> as<00:03:25.090> well<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.410> know<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
North Africa as well so you know the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.690 
North Africa as well so you know the
silver<00:03:28.360> lining<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.140> will<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.130> story

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
silver lining if you will of this story
