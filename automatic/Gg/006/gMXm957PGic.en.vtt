but<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> figured<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.740> gladiator<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.850> would

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but I figured with gladiator this would

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.520 
but I figured with gladiator this would
be<00:02:06.180> better<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> give<00:02:07.290> him<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
be better because if you give him the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
be better because if you give him the
full<00:02:07.680> gauntlet<00:02:08.129> now<00:02:08.310> he's<00:02:08.789> got<00:02:08.970> hypersonic

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
full gauntlet now he's got hypersonic

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
full gauntlet now he's got hypersonic
and<00:02:09.959> he<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.500> push<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> can't<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.220> outwitted

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and he can push and can't be outwitted

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.010 
and he can push and can't be outwitted
and<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.020> dial<00:02:13.379> but<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and I really like this dial but the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.630 
and I really like this dial but the
think<00:02:14.200> holding<00:02:14.470> them<00:02:14.590> back<00:02:14.770> was<00:02:15.220> he<00:02:15.400> couldn't

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
think holding them back was he couldn't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.600 
think holding them back was he couldn't
push<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:17.350> was<00:02:17.770> my<00:02:18.070> idea<00:02:18.370> with<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
push so that was my idea with that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.060 
push so that was my idea with that
figured<00:02:19.420> would<00:02:19.990> be<00:02:20.140> pretty<00:02:20.830> competitive

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
figured would be pretty competitive

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.890 
figured would be pretty competitive
wasn't<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> hundred<00:02:22.210> percent<00:02:22.420> sure<00:02:22.660> on<00:02:22.840> how

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
wasn't a hundred percent sure on how

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.840 
wasn't a hundred percent sure on how
good<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.380> would<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.740> thought<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> would<00:02:24.460> be<00:02:24.550> fun

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
good it would do thought it would be fun

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.390 
good it would do thought it would be fun
I<00:02:25.090> will<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.750> through<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.130> figure

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
I will go through this this is a figure

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100 
I will go through this this is a figure
that<00:02:27.760> everyone<00:02:28.210> got<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.750> prized

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
that everyone got for prized

that everyone got for prized
participation<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> I'll<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:30.520> through<00:02:30.760> this

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
participation and I'll go through this

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.810 
participation and I'll go through this

Dom<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.890> through<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> dial<00:02:45.400> really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
Dom and going through the dial really

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.250 
Dom and going through the dial really
quick<00:02:46.000> here<00:02:46.210> I'm<00:02:46.360> not<00:02:46.450> gonna<00:02:46.630> show<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
quick here I'm not gonna show it to you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.610 
quick here I'm not gonna show it to you
but<00:02:47.530> she<00:02:48.100> pretty<00:02:48.400> much<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.480> three<00:02:50.410> damage

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
but she pretty much can do three damage

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.350 
but she pretty much can do three damage
throughout<00:02:51.100> her<00:02:51.250> whole<00:02:51.400> dial<00:02:51.700> she<00:02:51.970> ends<00:02:52.270> up

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
throughout her whole dial she ends up

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.960 
throughout her whole dial she ends up
with<00:02:52.420> flurry<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.220> middle<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.640> her<00:02:54.730> dial

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
with flurry in the middle of her dial

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.300 
with flurry in the middle of her dial
and<00:02:55.330> then<00:02:55.690> late<00:02:55.990> dial<00:02:56.290> she<00:02:56.500> has<00:02:56.590> close<00:02:57.040> combat

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and then late dial she has close combat

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.520 
and then late dial she has close combat
expert<00:02:57.910> she<00:02:58.240> was<00:02:58.330> actually<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.990> that<00:02:59.230> bad<00:02:59.500> for

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
expert she was actually not that bad for

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.930 
expert she was actually not that bad for
a<00:02:59.740> hundred<00:02:59.980> points<00:03:00.310> she's<00:03:00.520> not<00:03:00.670> super

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
a hundred points she's not super

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.720 
a hundred points she's not super
powerful<00:03:01.570> but<00:03:02.410> she<00:03:02.680> complements<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.520> nose

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
powerful but she complements the nose

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.340 
powerful but she complements the nose
pretty<00:03:04.090> well<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.720> results<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
pretty well so the results of the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.090 
pretty well so the results of the
tournament<00:03:05.800> we<00:03:05.920> had<00:03:06.130> 18<00:03:06.760> players<00:03:07.180> so

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
tournament we had 18 players so

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.410 
tournament we had 18 players so
basically<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.310> was<00:03:09.430> gonna<00:03:09.550> be<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> four<00:03:10.150> round

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
basically it was gonna be a four round

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.680 
basically it was gonna be a four round
tournament<00:03:11.020> but<00:03:11.260> if<00:03:11.380> one<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.070> players

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
tournament but if one of the players

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.720 
tournament but if one of the players
forced<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.930> game<00:03:14.380> five<00:03:14.740> because<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.550> two

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
forced a game five because of two

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.120 
forced a game five because of two
undefeated<00:03:15.970> teams<00:03:16.480> then<00:03:17.170> we<00:03:17.320> would<00:03:17.500> force<00:03:17.950> a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
undefeated teams then we would force a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.100 
undefeated teams then we would force a
game<00:03:18.310> five<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.910> was<00:03:19.150> able<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.450> win<00:03:19.690> my<00:03:19.840> first

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
game five I was able to win my first

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.070 
game five I was able to win my first
match<00:03:20.350> then<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.280> got<00:03:21.459> put<00:03:21.730> into<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.630> bracket

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
match then I got put into the bracket

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.560 
match then I got put into the bracket
where<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.740> was<00:03:24.130> playing<00:03:24.580> against<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> losers

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
where I was playing against the losers

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.150 
where I was playing against the losers
but<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.900> had<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> winning<00:03:26.410> bracket<00:03:26.920> because<00:03:27.010> I

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
but I had a winning bracket because I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.699 
but I had a winning bracket because I
had<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> least<00:03:27.850> points<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.750> won<00:03:29.020> my<00:03:29.170> second

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
had the least points so I won my second

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.220 
had the least points so I won my second
match<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:30.940> my<00:03:31.120> third<00:03:31.150> match<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:32.020> also

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
match and then my third match I also

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.160 
match and then my third match I also
played<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.970> highest<00:03:34.390> point<00:03:34.690> character

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
played the the highest point character

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.320 
played the the highest point character
with<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.380> loss<00:03:35.680> which<00:03:36.520> was<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> very<00:03:37.090> difficult

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
with a loss which was a very difficult

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.050 
with a loss which was a very difficult
team<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.020> had<00:03:38.200> German<00:03:38.500> mu<00:03:38.860> gamma<00:03:39.310> bomb<00:03:39.640> and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
team that had German mu gamma bomb and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.900 
team that had German mu gamma bomb and
The<00:03:40.900> Watcher<00:03:41.440> where<00:03:41.740> he<00:03:41.920> would<00:03:42.430> sit<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
The Watcher where he would sit the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.850 
The Watcher where he would sit the
watcher<00:03:43.270> on<00:03:43.300> top<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.870> gamma<00:03:44.080> bomb<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.800> you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
watcher on top of the gamma bomb so you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.830 
watcher on top of the gamma bomb so you
had<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.250> take<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.730> figure<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.330> first<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
had to take that figure out first and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.660 
had to take that figure out first and
then<00:03:46.900> disarm<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:47.950> was<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.310> able<00:03:48.550> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
then disarm it and I was not able to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
was actually pretty interesting because

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.780 
was actually pretty interesting because
he<00:04:19.390> was<00:04:19.510> able<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.900> use<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.770> magic<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.549> take

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
away my hypersonic which was really

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.710 
away my hypersonic which was really
difficult<00:04:25.000> got<00:04:25.810> into<00:04:26.140> position

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
difficult got into position

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.750 
difficult got into position
where<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> could<00:04:27.080> block<00:04:27.530> him<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.040> then<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.520> just

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
where I could block him and then I just

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.820 
where I could block him and then I just
used<00:04:29.150> Running<00:04:29.690> Shot<00:04:29.750> with<00:04:30.050> pulse<00:04:30.290> wave<00:04:30.530> to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
used Running Shot with pulse wave to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.450 
used Running Shot with pulse wave to
pulse<00:04:31.190> wave<00:04:31.720> Scarlet<00:04:32.720> Witch<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.310> Wonder<00:04:34.310> Man

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
pulse wave Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.080

to<00:04:34.910> take<00:04:35.420> him<00:04:35.600> out<00:04:35.750> within<00:04:36.080> three<00:04:36.590> turns<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.460> I

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
to take him out within three turns and I

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.180 
to take him out within three turns and I
was<00:04:38.240> able<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.480> beat<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.650> team<00:04:39.980> which

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
was able to beat that that team which

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.920 
was able to beat that that team which
was<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.520> thought<00:04:40.790> was<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> pretty<00:04:41.210> good<00:04:41.390> team<00:04:41.630> and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
was I thought was a pretty good team and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.290 
was I thought was a pretty good team and
he<00:04:42.140> actually<00:04:42.290> did<00:04:42.650> pretty<00:04:42.950> well<00:04:43.070> but<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.180> think

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
he actually did pretty well but I think

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.050 
he actually did pretty well but I think
with<00:04:44.600> gladiator<00:04:45.020> being<00:04:45.470> able<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.710> be<00:04:45.830> able<00:04:45.920> to

Bolt<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:51.050> pulse<00:04:51.350> wave<00:04:51.590> was<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.400> really

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
Bolt to pulse wave was just really

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.310 
Bolt to pulse wave was just really
really<00:04:53.480> good<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.890> was<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:56.000> an<00:04:56.270> O<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.810> I

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
really good so I was for an O and I

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.510 
really good so I was for an O and I
forced<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.920> game<00:04:57.950> five<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.510> I<00:05:00.200> went<00:05:00.440> up<00:05:00.560> against

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
forced a game five and I went up against

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.480 
forced a game five and I went up against
a<00:05:01.820> mastermold<00:05:02.600> team<00:05:02.960> with<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.830> couple<00:05:04.220> shield

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
everybody energy shield deflection and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.100 
everybody energy shield deflection and
mole<00:05:15.620> now<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.040> team<00:05:16.310> was<00:05:16.520> very<00:05:16.910> very<00:05:17.810> good

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
mole now that team was very very good

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.150 
mole now that team was very very good
obviously<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:19.190> made<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.700> finals<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.450> I

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
obviously it made it to the finals and I

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.280 
obviously it made it to the finals and I
got<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.580> top<00:05:22.820> part<00:05:23.360> of<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.510> map<00:05:23.660> even<00:05:24.200> though

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
got the top part of the map even though

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.110 
got the top part of the map even though
I<00:05:24.320> lost<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.890> map<00:05:25.070> role<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.550> actually<00:05:25.760> played

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
I lost the map role I actually played

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.940 
I lost the map role I actually played
the<00:05:26.270> bottom<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.810> whole<00:05:27.080> tournament<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.860> I

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
the bottom the whole tournament and I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.250 
the bottom the whole tournament and I
switched<00:05:28.250> sides<00:05:28.580> on<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.940> map<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.960> he

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
switched sides on the map because he

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.230 
switched sides on the map because he
wanted<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.740> bottom<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.820> think<00:05:32.060> that

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
wanted the bottom and I think that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.810 
wanted the bottom and I think that
really<00:05:32.510> helped<00:05:32.810> him<00:05:32.930> out<00:05:33.050> tremendously<00:05:33.820> not

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
really helped him out tremendously not

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820 
really helped him out tremendously not
that<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.090> wasn't<00:05:35.330> prepared<00:05:35.810> for<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.140> top<00:05:36.320> level

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
that I wasn't prepared for the top level

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.120 
that I wasn't prepared for the top level
it's<00:05:37.430> just<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.940> think<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:39.230> team<00:05:39.500> plays<00:05:39.890> better

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
it's just I think this team plays better

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.730 
it's just I think this team plays better
from<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.610> bottom<00:05:40.940> but<00:05:41.450> anyways<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.080> got<00:05:42.440> up<00:05:42.590> in

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
from the bottom but anyways I got up in

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.440 
from the bottom but anyways I got up in
the<00:05:42.860> corners<00:05:43.340> all<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.880> way<00:05:44.030> up<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
the corners all the way up in the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.590 
the corners all the way up in the
corners<00:05:44.900> of<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:46.040> top<00:05:46.250> level<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:46.940> because

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
corners of the top level and because

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
corners of the top level and because
Black<00:05:47.990> Bolt<00:05:48.169> and<00:05:48.410> gladiator<00:05:48.860> can<00:05:49.070> fly<00:05:49.340> over<00:05:49.669> I

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
Black Bolt and gladiator can fly over I

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
Black Bolt and gladiator can fly over I
thought<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.770> was<00:05:51.919> probably<00:05:52.220> gonna<00:05:52.400> give<00:05:52.580> me

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
thought that was probably gonna give me

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.820 
thought that was probably gonna give me
the<00:05:52.760> best<00:05:53.000> chance<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.690> mastermold<00:05:54.290> that<00:05:54.470> 200

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
the best chance but mastermold that 200

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.100 
the best chance but mastermold that 200
points<00:05:55.130> has<00:05:55.250> multi<00:05:55.669> attack<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.360> he<00:05:56.750> had<00:05:56.900> all

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
points has multi attack and he had all

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.980 
points has multi attack and he had all
the<00:05:57.260> shield<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.040> perplexes<00:05:59.030> he<00:05:59.479> just<00:05:59.720> started

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
the shield and perplexes he just started

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.370 
the shield and perplexes he just started
to<00:06:00.200> multi<00:06:00.740> attack<00:06:01.040> blowing<00:06:01.669> out<00:06:01.790> walls<00:06:02.200> two<00:06:03.200> at

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
to multi attack blowing out walls two at

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.070 
to multi attack blowing out walls two at
a<00:06:03.410> time<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:04.190> it<00:06:04.370> was<00:06:04.520> just<00:06:04.550> really<00:06:05.030> really<00:06:05.750> bad

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
a time and it was just really really bad

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.560 
a time and it was just really really bad
and<00:06:06.380> then<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.160> had<00:06:07.700> to<00:06:07.820> make<00:06:07.970> one<00:06:08.210> last-ditch

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
and then I had to make one last-ditch

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.560 
and then I had to make one last-ditch
effort<00:06:09.260> or<00:06:09.530> just<00:06:10.130> stall<00:06:10.460> even<00:06:10.910> longer<00:06:11.150> which<00:06:11.450> I

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
effort or just stall even longer which I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.000 
effort or just stall even longer which I
didn't<00:06:11.810> really<00:06:11.990> want<00:06:12.290> to<00:06:12.410> stall<00:06:12.620> I<00:06:12.650> was<00:06:12.860> just

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
didn't really want to stall I was just

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.110 
didn't really want to stall I was just
trying<00:06:13.190> to<00:06:13.220> give<00:06:13.370> myself<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.790> best

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
trying to give myself the best

trying to give myself the best
opportunity<00:06:14.750> to<00:06:14.870> make<00:06:15.020> an<00:06:15.169> attack<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.710> got<00:06:16.070> a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
opportunity to make an attack I got a

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.260 
opportunity to make an attack I got a
perplex<00:06:17.000> with<00:06:17.960> guided<00:06:18.410> her<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.530> a<00:06:18.910> 13<00:06:19.910> attack

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
he was perplexed up to a 20

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.770 
he was perplexed up to a 20
I<00:06:22.610> had<00:06:23.300> gladiator<00:06:24.100> hypersonic<00:06:25.100> down<00:06:25.780> before

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
I had gladiator hypersonic down before

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.320 
I had gladiator hypersonic down before
that<00:06:26.930> I<00:06:27.260> had<00:06:27.560> Scarlet<00:06:28.280> Witch<00:06:28.430> go<00:06:28.910> to<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.180> edge

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
that I had Scarlet Witch go to the edge

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.710 
that I had Scarlet Witch go to the edge
she<00:06:29.780> phage<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.620> edge<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.360> so<00:06:32.360> I<00:06:32.390> could<00:06:32.630> get

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
she phage to the edge and so I could get

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.310 
she phage to the edge and so I could get
a<00:06:32.780> prob<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.320> needed<00:06:33.650> a<00:06:33.740> 7<00:06:34.310> on<00:06:34.729> mastermold<00:06:35.330> for<00:06:35.750> 7

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
a prob I needed a 7 on mastermold for 7

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.710 
a prob I needed a 7 on mastermold for 7
damage<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:37.010> missed<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.640> first<00:06:37.789> attack<00:06:38.180> role<00:06:38.450> I

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
damage I missed the first attack role I

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.180 
damage I missed the first attack role I
propped<00:06:39.410> it

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
propped it

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.640 
propped it
stood<00:06:40.430> again<00:06:40.760> and<00:06:41.120> that<00:06:41.690> was<00:06:41.810> pretty<00:06:42.140> much<00:06:42.260> the

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
stood again and that was pretty much the

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.070 
stood again and that was pretty much the
tournament<00:06:43.160> because<00:06:43.310> then<00:06:43.580> at<00:06:43.910> that<00:06:44.120> point<00:06:44.480> he

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
tournament because then at that point he

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.440 
tournament because then at that point he
was<00:06:45.230> pushed<00:06:45.590> but<00:06:46.040> with<00:06:46.250> colossal<00:06:47.030> do<00:06:47.150> you<00:06:47.270> have

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
was pushed but with colossal do you have

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.570 
was pushed but with colossal do you have
colossal<00:06:47.960> stamina<00:06:48.440> where<00:06:48.650> they<00:06:48.830> can<00:06:49.130> push

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
colossal stamina where they can push

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.900 
colossal stamina where they can push
again<00:06:50.060> beyond<00:06:50.480> that<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:51.110> he<00:06:51.950> had<00:06:52.250> on<00:06:52.550> his

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910

gauntlet<00:06:53.420> he<00:06:53.630> had<00:06:53.720> psychic<00:06:54.110> blast<00:06:54.350> so<00:06:54.680> he

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
gauntlet he had psychic blast so he

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.380 
gauntlet he had psychic blast so he
multi<00:06:55.190> text<00:06:55.550> like<00:06:55.700> a<00:06:55.730> blast

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
multi text like a blast

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.990 
multi text like a blast
gladiator<00:06:56.840> two<00:06:57.680> times<00:06:57.980> and<00:06:58.280> knocked<00:06:58.700> him<00:06:58.880> out

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
gladiator two times and knocked him out

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.690 
gladiator two times and knocked him out
and<00:06:59.410> that<00:07:00.410> was<00:07:00.590> pretty<00:07:00.800> much<00:07:01.040> it<00:07:01.310> I<00:07:01.340> was<00:07:01.670> not

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
and that was pretty much it I was not

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.360 
and that was pretty much it I was not
able<00:07:02.000> to<00:07:02.150> do<00:07:03.050> much<00:07:03.320> with<00:07:03.560> the<00:07:03.710> rest<00:07:03.890> of<00:07:03.980> my<00:07:04.100> team

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
able to do much with the rest of my team

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.850 
able to do much with the rest of my team
I<00:07:04.670> tried<00:07:05.210> to<00:07:05.330> make<00:07:05.480> one<00:07:05.720> last-ditch<00:07:06.080> effort<00:07:06.620> to

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
I tried to make one last-ditch effort to

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.620 
I tried to make one last-ditch effort to
try<00:07:07.220> to<00:07:07.250> maybe<00:07:07.550> take<00:07:07.820> out<00:07:07.970> some<00:07:08.210> support

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
try to maybe take out some support

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.270 
try to maybe take out some support
figures<00:07:08.990> because<00:07:09.380> then<00:07:09.620> if<00:07:09.770> I<00:07:09.860> could<00:07:10.040> take<00:07:10.130> out

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
figures because then if I could take out

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.920 
figures because then if I could take out
the<00:07:10.400> support<00:07:10.820> figures<00:07:11.180> even<00:07:11.480> though<00:07:11.750> there

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
the support figures even though there

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.020 
the support figures even though there
was<00:07:12.050> like<00:07:12.230> five<00:07:12.650> of<00:07:12.680> them<00:07:12.950> I<00:07:13.280> might<00:07:13.820> have<00:07:14.000> a

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
was like five of them I might have a

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.810 
was like five of them I might have a
chance<00:07:14.120> on<00:07:14.540> points<00:07:15.080> but<00:07:15.560> when<00:07:15.860> I<00:07:15.890> came<00:07:16.010> down<00:07:16.460> I

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
chance on points but when I came down I

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.030 
chance on points but when I came down I
did<00:07:17.420> pulse<00:07:17.720> wave<00:07:17.990> and<00:07:18.230> take<00:07:18.410> out<00:07:18.590> Scarlet

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
did pulse wave and take out Scarlet

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.460 
did pulse wave and take out Scarlet
Witch<00:07:19.220> but<00:07:19.610> when<00:07:20.300> I<00:07:20.330> pushed<00:07:20.660> again<00:07:21.020> to<00:07:21.200> try<00:07:21.350> to

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
Witch but when I pushed again to try to

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.820 
Witch but when I pushed again to try to
do<00:07:21.680> some<00:07:21.890> damage<00:07:22.310> I<00:07:22.660> pushed<00:07:23.660> to<00:07:24.200> crit<00:07:24.560> Miss

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
do some damage I pushed to crit Miss

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.860 
do some damage I pushed to crit Miss
pretty<00:07:25.400> much<00:07:25.610> was<00:07:25.790> out<00:07:25.970> there<00:07:26.210> left<00:07:26.540> to<00:07:26.660> dry

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
pretty much was out there left to dry

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.380 
pretty much was out there left to dry
and<00:07:27.230> at<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.770> point<00:07:27.950> when<00:07:28.190> gladiator<00:07:28.580> was

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
and at the point when gladiator was

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.600 
and at the point when gladiator was
taken<00:07:29.720> out<00:07:29.870> you<00:07:30.620> know<00:07:30.740> that<00:07:31.010> was<00:07:31.160> pretty<00:07:31.460> much

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
taken out you know that was pretty much

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.880 
taken out you know that was pretty much
the<00:07:31.850> tournament<00:07:32.330> so<00:07:32.510> I<00:07:32.540> was<00:07:32.870> like<00:07:33.500> pretty<00:07:33.830> much

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:33.890 
the tournament so I was like pretty much

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.130 
the tournament so I was like pretty much
done<00:07:34.280> at<00:07:34.460> that<00:07:34.610> point<00:07:34.880> but<00:07:35.090> I<00:07:35.150> figured<00:07:35.720> might

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140 
done at that point but I figured might

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.500 
done at that point but I figured might
as<00:07:36.170> well<00:07:36.350> try<00:07:36.560> to<00:07:36.620> play<00:07:36.860> it<00:07:36.950> out<00:07:37.070> but<00:07:37.670> it<00:07:37.910> wasn't

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.510 
as well try to play it out but it wasn't
