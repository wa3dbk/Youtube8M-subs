00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980 

so<00:00:23.610> what<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.789> fashion<00:00:25.330> going<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.539> look<00:00:25.660> like<00:00:25.840> in

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
so what is fashion going to look like in

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.430 
so what is fashion going to look like in
the<00:00:26.080> future

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
the future

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.380 
the future
now<00:00:27.220> I'm<00:00:27.340> not<00:00:27.460> talking<00:00:27.580> about<00:00:27.730> oat<00:00:28.030> Couture

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
now I'm not talking about oat Couture

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.600 
now I'm not talking about oat Couture
because<00:00:28.690> it's<00:00:29.230> really<00:00:29.590> hard<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.250> predict

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
because it's really hard to predict

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.139 
because it's really hard to predict
where<00:00:32.160> artists<00:00:33.160> are<00:00:33.219> going<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> go<00:00:33.610> with<00:00:34.000> their

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
where artists are going to go with their

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.270 
where artists are going to go with their
ideas<00:00:34.539> and<00:00:34.899> really<00:00:35.260> at<00:00:35.530> that<00:00:35.590> point<00:00:35.710> when

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
ideas and really at that point when

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.110 
ideas and really at that point when
you're<00:00:36.370> when<00:00:36.670> you're<00:00:36.699> talking<00:00:36.940> about<00:00:36.970> very

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
you're when you're talking about very

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.380 
you're when you're talking about very
high-end<00:00:38.310> concept<00:00:39.310> fashion<00:00:39.730> it's<00:00:39.940> really

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
high-end concept fashion it's really

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.229 
high-end concept fashion it's really
pretty<00:00:40.540> hard<00:00:40.810> to<00:00:40.930> predict<00:00:41.310> but<00:00:42.310> I<00:00:42.640> think<00:00:43.000> that

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
pretty hard to predict but I think that

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.330 
pretty hard to predict but I think that
in<00:00:43.480> terms<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:44.050> street<00:00:44.440> layer<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.920> what<00:00:45.070> people

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
in terms of street layer and what people

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.000 
in terms of street layer and what people
are<00:00:45.460> wearing<00:00:45.579> day<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.940> day<00:00:46.180> we<00:00:47.170> can<00:00:47.440> pretty

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
are wearing day to day we can pretty

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.340 
are wearing day to day we can pretty
easily<00:00:48.809> postulate<00:00:49.809> where<00:00:49.989> we're<00:00:50.170> going<00:00:50.290> to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
easily postulate where we're going to

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.920 
easily postulate where we're going to
end<00:00:50.530> up<00:00:50.649> in<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.950> not-too-distant<00:00:51.309> future

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
end up in the not-too-distant future

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.990 
end up in the not-too-distant future
already<00:00:52.930> there<00:00:53.500> are<00:00:53.920> designers<00:00:54.460> like<00:00:54.670> Diana

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
already there are designers like Diana

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.869 
already there are designers like Diana
Eng<00:00:55.270> who<00:00:55.980> incorporate<00:00:56.980> technology<00:00:57.760> and

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
Eng who incorporate technology and

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.569 
Eng who incorporate technology and
science<00:00:58.329> into<00:00:58.780> their<00:00:58.930> designs<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.770> for

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
science into their designs and for

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.330 
science into their designs and for
example<00:01:00.790> she<00:01:01.149> created<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.110> hoodie<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.770> had

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
example she created a hoodie that had

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.120 
example she created a hoodie that had
both<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:04.210> heart<00:01:04.839> rate<00:01:04.930> monitor<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.680> camera

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
both a heart rate monitor and a camera

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.990 
both a heart rate monitor and a camera
embedded<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:06.670> it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
embedded in it

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.359 
embedded in it
so<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.360> idea<00:01:07.689> was<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.200> when<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.979> wearer's

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
so the idea was that when the wearer's

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.130 
so the idea was that when the wearer's
heart<00:01:09.640> rate<00:01:09.850> reached<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.299> certain<00:01:10.450> level<00:01:10.600> or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
heart rate reached a certain level or

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.960 
heart rate reached a certain level or
exceeded<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.619> certain<00:01:11.890> level<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.640> camera

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
exceeded a certain level the camera

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.670 
exceeded a certain level the camera
would<00:01:13.090> automatically<00:01:13.630> snap<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:13.990> picture<00:01:14.290> and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
would automatically snap a picture and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.250 
would automatically snap a picture and
when<00:01:15.610> she<00:01:15.790> conceived<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> idea<00:01:16.930> was

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
when she conceived of it the idea was

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.100 
when she conceived of it the idea was
that<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:18.250> would<00:01:18.280> be<00:01:18.640> capturing<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.750> wearer's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
that it would be capturing the wearer's

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.840 
that it would be capturing the wearer's
life<00:01:20.439> in<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.830> moments<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.220> were<00:01:21.369> important

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
life in the moments that were important

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.580 
life in the moments that were important
to<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.090> wearer<00:01:22.330> throughout<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> day<00:01:23.170> so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
to that wearer throughout the day so

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.020 
to that wearer throughout the day so
that<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.830> would<00:01:23.920> have<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.100> record<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.909> know

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
that it would have a record of you know

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.429 
that it would have a record of you know
all<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.420> exciting<00:01:25.840> things<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:26.170> happen

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
all of the exciting things that happen

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.929 
all of the exciting things that happen
to<00:01:26.500> them<00:01:26.650> while<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:27.430> were<00:01:27.460> wearing<00:01:27.820> her

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
to them while they were wearing her

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.690 
to them while they were wearing her
garment<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.720> course<00:01:29.320> it's<00:01:29.500> very<00:01:29.590> very<00:01:30.159> easy<00:01:30.220> to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
garment of course it's very very easy to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.940 
garment of course it's very very easy to
see<00:01:30.909> potential<00:01:31.630> military<00:01:31.810> applications<00:01:32.799> of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
see potential military applications of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.520 
see potential military applications of
something<00:01:33.189> like<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.960> has<00:01:35.259> even

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
something like this and there has even

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.219 
something like this and there has even
been<00:01:35.830> discussions<00:01:36.520> about<00:01:36.900> possibly<00:01:37.900> using<00:01:38.049> a

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
been discussions about possibly using a

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.830 
been discussions about possibly using a
technology<00:01:38.560> like<00:01:39.009> that<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.400> monitor<00:01:39.840> parolees

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
technology like that to monitor parolees

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.380 
technology like that to monitor parolees
so<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:42.009> know<00:01:42.130> as<00:01:42.310> their<00:01:42.729> excitement

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
so that you know as their excitement

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.240 
so that you know as their excitement
levels<00:01:43.659> maybe<00:01:43.990> go<00:01:44.259> up<00:01:44.439> as<00:01:44.619> they're<00:01:44.830> thinking

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
levels maybe go up as they're thinking

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.819 
levels maybe go up as they're thinking
about<00:01:45.520> possibly<00:01:46.259> falling<00:01:47.259> back<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.439> their

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
about possibly falling back to their

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.560 
about possibly falling back to their
criminal<00:01:48.040> behavior<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.329> could<00:01:49.540> be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
criminal behavior that that could be

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.390 
criminal behavior that that could be
monitored<00:01:50.020> which<00:01:50.259> brings<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.650> some<00:01:50.829> other<00:01:50.950> you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
monitored which brings up some other you

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.080 
monitored which brings up some other you
know<00:01:51.720> theoretical<00:01:52.720> issues<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.909> think

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
know theoretical issues but if you think

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.789 
know theoretical issues but if you think
about<00:01:55.329> that<00:01:55.479> technology<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.380> then<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.650> think

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
about that technology and then you think

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.380 
about that technology and then you think
about<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.159> fact<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.520> there<00:01:58.060> are<00:01:58.210> also

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
about the fact that there are also

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510 
about the fact that there are also
designers<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.470> even<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.950> scientists<00:02:00.369> that

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
designers and even just scientists that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
designers and even just scientists that
aren't<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:00.790> fashion<00:02:01.240> designers

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
aren't really fashion designers

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.010 
aren't really fashion designers
developing<00:02:02.829> clothing<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.490> has<00:02:03.840> LCD<00:02:04.840> and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
developing clothing that has LCD and

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.860 
developing clothing that has LCD and
Plasma<00:02:05.079> displays<00:02:05.770> embedded<00:02:06.310> in

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
Plasma displays embedded in

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.590 
Plasma displays embedded in
you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> garments<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.040> are<00:02:08.240> full<00:02:09.240> display

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
you know garments that are full display

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040 
you know garments that are full display
pieces<00:02:09.930> really<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:11.520> becomes<00:02:11.970> very<00:02:12.390> very<00:02:12.750> easy

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
pieces really it becomes very very easy

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.880 
pieces really it becomes very very easy
to<00:02:13.380> see<00:02:13.620> how<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:15.120> move<00:02:15.330> forward

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
to see how as we move forward

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.570 
to see how as we move forward
technologies<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.520> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
technologies like that are going to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.040 
technologies like that are going to
integrate<00:02:17.850> not<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.480> clothing<00:02:18.780> but

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
integrate not just with clothing but

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.130 
integrate not just with clothing but
with<00:02:19.170> each<00:02:19.380> other<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:21.330> could<00:02:21.660> for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
with each other so that you could for

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.330 
with each other so that you could for
example<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.830> thought<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.160> those<00:02:23.280> two

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
example if you thought of those two

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.270 
example if you thought of those two
technologies<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.810> wearing<00:02:25.350> something<00:02:25.830> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
technologies be wearing something that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.890 
technologies be wearing something that
captures<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> picture<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.270> you're<00:02:27.390> excited

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
captures a picture when you're excited

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.710 
captures a picture when you're excited
and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.290> displays<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:30.150> very<00:02:30.300> garment

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and then displays it on the very garment

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.760 
and then displays it on the very garment
that<00:02:30.810> you're<00:02:30.960> wearing<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.650> you're

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
that you're wearing so that you're

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.530 
that you're wearing so that you're
almost<00:02:32.100> literally<00:02:32.550> wearing<00:02:33.000> your<00:02:33.150> heart<00:02:33.300> on

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
almost literally wearing your heart on

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.510 
almost literally wearing your heart on
your<00:02:33.720> sleeve

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
your sleeve

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.250 
your sleeve
additionally<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.820> also<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.450> nano

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
additionally we also have nano

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.920 
additionally we also have nano
generators<00:02:37.950> coming<00:02:38.340> out<00:02:38.460> which<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:39.540> say<00:02:39.750> are

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
generators coming out which they say are

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.720 
generators coming out which they say are
only<00:02:40.140> about<00:02:40.440> five<00:02:40.740> years<00:02:40.920> off<00:02:41.190> from<00:02:41.220> being

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
only about five years off from being

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.460 
only about five years off from being
integrated<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.330> our<00:02:42.450> day-to-day<00:02:42.630> lives<00:02:43.050> which

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
integrated in our day-to-day lives which

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.220 
integrated in our day-to-day lives which
are<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:43.830> very<00:02:44.190> tiny<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.210> mean<00:02:45.780> when<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.020> say

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
are very very tiny I mean when they say

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.480 
are very very tiny I mean when they say
Nano<00:02:46.590> they<00:02:46.860> mean<00:02:47.070> tiny<00:02:48.470> tiny<00:02:49.470> chips<00:02:49.890> that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
Nano they mean tiny tiny chips that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.960 
Nano they mean tiny tiny chips that
basically<00:02:51.330> they're<00:02:51.720> flexible<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.470> they

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
basically they're flexible and they

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.790 
basically they're flexible and they
harness<00:02:53.970> kinetic<00:02:54.420> energy<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.290> store<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
harness kinetic energy and can store it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.950 
harness kinetic energy and can store it
as<00:02:55.950> usable<00:02:56.370> energy<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.240> far<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> think

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
as usable energy and so far I think

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.690 
as usable energy and so far I think
they're<00:02:58.110> about<00:02:58.380> at<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.740> point<00:02:58.950> where<00:02:59.520> they

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
they're about at the point where they

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.460 
they're about at the point where they
can<00:02:59.940> harness<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.540> equivalent<00:03:01.050> energy<00:03:01.140> of

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can harness the equivalent energy of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.960 
can harness the equivalent energy of
about<00:03:01.680> two<00:03:02.040> AAA<00:03:02.280> batteries

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
about two AAA batteries

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300 
about two AAA batteries
what<00:03:03.510> does<00:03:03.600> basically<00:03:03.900> means<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.380> this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
what does basically means is that this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.480 
what does basically means is that this
chip<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.700> embedded<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.480> your<00:03:07.260> hoody<00:03:07.950> your

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
chip is embedded in your hoody your

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.520 
chip is embedded in your hoody your
running<00:03:08.910> pants<00:03:09.420> whatever<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.990> as<00:03:10.140> you're

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
running pants whatever and as you're

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.979 
running pants whatever and as you're
moving<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:11.489> flexing<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.330> every<00:03:12.660> flex

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
moving it's flexing and every flex

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.229 
moving it's flexing and every flex
creates<00:03:13.590> some<00:03:13.860> current<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.550> current<00:03:14.910> is

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
creates some current and that current is

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.210 
creates some current and that current is
being<00:03:15.390> stored<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.650> means<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.130> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
being stored and that means that that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.880 
being stored and that means that that
could<00:03:17.280> potentially<00:03:18.320> power<00:03:19.320> your<00:03:19.590> mobile

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
could potentially power your mobile

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.350 
could potentially power your mobile
devices<00:03:20.190> power<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.830> mp3<00:03:22.830> player<00:03:22.910> power<00:03:23.910> you

devices power your mp3 player power you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540 
devices power your mp3 player power you
know<00:03:24.480> any<00:03:24.690> number<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.170> things<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.890> more<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
know any number of things and more and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.000 
know any number of things and more and
more<00:03:26.700> going<00:03:26.970> forward<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:28.560> we've<00:03:28.770> been

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
more going forward but as we've been

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.220 
more going forward but as we've been
really<00:03:30.000> wearing<00:03:30.300> through<00:03:30.480> our<00:03:30.600> fossil<00:03:30.810> fuels

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
really wearing through our fossil fuels

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.260 
really wearing through our fossil fuels
and<00:03:31.590> we're<00:03:31.950> exploring<00:03:32.190> new<00:03:32.459> technologies<00:03:32.670> I

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
and we're exploring new technologies I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.580 
and we're exploring new technologies I
think<00:03:33.300> our<00:03:33.630> clothing<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.350> become

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think our clothing is going to become

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.229 
think our clothing is going to become
one<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> technologies<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.550> we<00:03:35.820> harness

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
one of the technologies that we harness

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.260 
one of the technologies that we harness
to<00:03:36.900> make<00:03:37.110> ourselves<00:03:38.060> sustainable<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
to make ourselves sustainable in the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.540 
to make ourselves sustainable in the
long<00:03:39.540> run<00:03:39.780> otherwise<00:03:40.440> we're<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:40.860> kind<00:03:41.489> of

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
long run otherwise we're just kind of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.270 
long run otherwise we're just kind of
being<00:03:41.730> foolish<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.380> look<00:03:43.770> forward<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
being foolish so I look forward to a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.420 
being foolish so I look forward to a
future<00:03:44.459> where<00:03:44.700> we<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.420> both<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.250> feel

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
future where we can both think and feel

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.180 
future where we can both think and feel
with<00:03:47.640> our<00:03:47.760> clothes<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.300> well<00:03:48.360> as<00:03:48.870> use<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.800> for

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
with our clothes as well as use them for

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.430
