has done this sort of stuff before knows
that<00:02:22.200> cibecue<00:02:22.680> reeks<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.250> once<00:02:23.909> you've<00:02:24.090> used

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that cibecue reeks and once you've used

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.220 
that cibecue reeks and once you've used
them<00:02:24.569> unless<00:02:25.469> you<00:02:25.620> take<00:02:25.859> great<00:02:26.099> care<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:27.230> three

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
them unless you take great care in three

them unless you take great care in three
threading<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.680> back<00:02:28.799> into<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> packet

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
threading it back into the packet

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.039 
threading it back into the packet
they're<00:02:29.579> usually<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.939> a<00:02:30.329> tangled<00:02:30.840> mess<00:02:30.989> of

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
they're usually just a tangled mess of

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.179 
they're usually just a tangled mess of
hooks<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.680> line

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189

so<00:02:32.609> these<00:02:32.730> cibecue<00:02:33.120> rods<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:33.689> designed<00:02:34.079> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so these cibecue rods are designed to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
so these cibecue rods are designed to
minimize<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.219> tangles<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.239> when

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
minimize the tangles that you get when

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
minimize the tangles that you get when
you're<00:02:36.569> using<00:02:36.780> these<00:02:37.049> rigs<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
you're using these rigs and make the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.250 
you're using these rigs and make the
whole<00:02:38.609> process<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:39.060> lot<00:02:39.090> easier<00:02:39.239> why<00:02:40.049> don't<00:02:40.200> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
whole process a lot easier why don't I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.869 
whole process a lot easier why don't I
get<00:02:40.469> this<00:02:40.650> rigged<00:02:41.099> up<00:02:41.219> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:41.639> I'll<00:02:41.730> just

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
get this rigged up and then I'll just

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.280 
get this rigged up and then I'll just
show<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.060> some<00:02:42.150> basic<00:02:42.599> tips<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.959> how<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.109> get

some baits and how to use these rigs and
these<00:02:46.019> quite<00:02:46.620> nifty<00:02:46.950> cibecue<00:02:47.370> rods

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.010 

okay<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.030> we've<00:03:06.300> got<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.450> rigged<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:06.960> you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
okay so we've got a rigged up now you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.720 
okay so we've got a rigged up now you
can<00:03:07.140> see<00:03:07.350> basically<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.220> pattern

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
can see basically it's just a pattern

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.550 
can see basically it's just a pattern
hasta<00:03:09.090> rig<00:03:09.270> which<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.690> basically<00:03:10.050> droppers

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
hasta rig which is basically droppers

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.740 
hasta rig which is basically droppers
got<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:11.370> little<00:03:11.550> jigs<00:03:11.970> off<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.510> side

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
got these little jigs off the side

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.180 
got these little jigs off the side
they've<00:03:12.960> got<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.320> fluro<00:03:13.560> bead<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.070> them

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
they've got a little fluro bead on them

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.880 
they've got a little fluro bead on them
really<00:03:14.730> sharp<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.270> hooks<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:16.290> little<00:03:16.770> sort
