what<00:00:03.179> we've<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.360> here<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.620> pump<00:00:05.069> that

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
what we've got here is the pump that

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.910 
what we've got here is the pump that
will<00:00:06.089> go<00:00:06.359> at<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.049> bottom<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.700> well

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
will go at the bottom of my well

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.270 
will go at the bottom of my well
underneath<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.219> windmill<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
underneath the windmill and the way it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.370 
underneath the windmill and the way it
works<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:16.310> check<00:00:17.310> about<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:18.090> that

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
works is we have check about here that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.939 
works is we have check about here that
lets<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.650> water<00:00:19.800> go<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:21.080> up<00:00:22.820> like<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.949> but

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
lets the water go out up like that but

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.070 
lets the water go out up like that but
it<00:00:26.070> won't<00:00:26.220> let<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> water<00:00:26.730> fall<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.840> down

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it won't let the water fall back down

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.580 
it won't let the water fall back down
into<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.740> chamber<00:00:29.720> we<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> piston<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
into this chamber we have the piston and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.229 
into this chamber we have the piston and
we<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:35.160> another<00:00:35.309> check<00:00:35.790> valve<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
we have here another check valve that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
we have here another check valve that
lets<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.600> water<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> chamber<00:00:37.950> into

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
lets the water go into the chamber into

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.209 
lets the water go into the chamber into
this<00:00:38.969> part<00:00:40.430> right<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.219> has

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this part right here and then this has

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
this part right here and then this has
this<00:00:44.640> piston<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
this piston which is this is just a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.040 
this piston which is this is just a
hitch<00:00:46.680> pin

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
hitch pin

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.040 
hitch pin
when<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.230> piston<00:00:50.090> goes<00:00:52.489> pulls<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.719> sucks

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
when this piston goes pulls up it sucks

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
when this piston goes pulls up it sucks
water<00:00:55.379> into<00:01:00.680> when<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.710> sucks<00:01:02.070> water<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:03.059> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
water into when it sucks water into this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
water into when it sucks water into this
chamber<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> push<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
chamber and I want to push it down and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.230 
chamber and I want to push it down and
pushes<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> water<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
pushes the water back out and this you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.710 
pushes the water back out and this you
can<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:10.400> has<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:12.140> filter<00:01:13.220> right<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.299> I've<00:01:15.299> got

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lets the weeds be blocked but let some

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.109 
lets the weeds be blocked but let some
water<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.680> through<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.979> use<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.850> here
