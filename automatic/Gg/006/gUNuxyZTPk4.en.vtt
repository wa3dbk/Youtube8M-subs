Release that button.

00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.498
- Have you released that button?
- Yes.

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:12.278
Great.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:17.704
On the set of “Convict in Love”

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:19.920
I have very wise thoughts.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.491
This is why we shot
a special "Mongrel" some time ago.

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.976
I had a very wise thought today too,

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:28.632
so there is going to be 
a next special episode of the Mongrel.

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:32.946
You can put that before the episode.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.383
A Roadside Mongrel

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:39.552
Episode 19:
The one with Pope Francis’ Drachma

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:41.912
God bless.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:49.172
Today is a very special day,
yesterday a new pope was chosen.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:53.152
There is no point if fooling ourselves,
the world has come to an end.

00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:54.835
At least for Dominicans.

00:01:55.452 --> 00:01:57.232
A Jesuit is a pope.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.334
Everyone says that 
probably his first decision

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:02.938
will be the cassation of the Dominicans.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.501
But this morning I read the news
and probably today, on Thursday,

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.756
on the first day of his pontificate
Pope Francis went

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.275
to the Basilica of Santa Maria
Maggiore in Rome,

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:16.811
which, as you know,
and those who don’t know

00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.587
are about to find out,
is run by Dominicans.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.920
For his first prayer,
for his first meeting,

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:29.694
Pope Francis, a Jesuit,
went to Dominicans.

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:36.875
Furthermore, the habit I wear is exactly
what Pope Francis is wearing now,

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.751
because popes
have worn white cassock

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:43.371
since the pope blessed Innocent V,

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.739
who after he was chosen
strongly stated

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.367
that he would wear a white habit
as he had had before.

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.519
He was a pope only for six months,

00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:58.446
but he started the tradition
of wearing a white habit.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.559
I believe that Dominicans
will somehow survive.

00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:07.662
And now seriously, I’m extremely happy
that we have a new pope like this.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:14.247
Yesterday during the announcement,
when the pope was shown to the world,

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:17.361
he made an amazing gesture.

00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.761
When he bowed down in front of
the whole Church

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.431
and asked the whole Church
to pray for him.

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:29.721
It reminded me of a parable
from the Gospel of St. Luke

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.132
and I’d like to say something
about it today.

00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:38.526
In chapter 15,
there are three beautiful parables:

00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:43.187
about a lost sheep, about a lost drachma
and about the prodigal son.

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:47.094
I think that we usually 
omit the middle one.

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.681
The one about the lost sheep is very nice,

00:03:49.681 --> 00:03:51.971
the one about the prodigal son is great,

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.578
and the one about a lost drachma
is slightly a trifle.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:04:00.511
I believe that this image somehow shows
the beginning of this pontificate.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.511
And this shows what Pope Francis
is probably going to do.

00:04:04.186 --> 00:04:10.761
There is description of a housewife,
a crazy housewife.

00:04:11.077 --> 00:04:14.514
She is a stange woman,
as people in all parables of Jesus.

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:16.912
She has lost one drachma.

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.939
In our language, we would say
that she has lost 10 cents,

00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:27.749
and she sweeps the whole house,
she almost takes away all the furniture,

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.937
she moves them to look for the coin.

00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:32.427
She cares so much about this coin.

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:35.688
And when she finds it, as Jesus said,

00:04:35.688 --> 00:04:40.670
she invites all of her friends
and throws a big party.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.571
What kind of a woman is she?

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:49.666
I don’t know anyone who would sweep
their house to find lost 10 cents,

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:53.882
and even if they would look for those
10 cents because they needed them,

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:59.761
they wouldn’t invite all of their friends
to say “I’ve found 10 cents!”.

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:04.327
Those are Jesus’s parables,
one insanity is followed by another.

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:09.237
But yesterday, when I saw Pope Francis,
who bowed down in front of the Church,

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:14.228
I immediately thought
that pope looks for 10 cents,

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:18.574
that pope in Vatican
on the Saint Peter Basilica balcony

00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:21.737
had lost a 10 cent coin
and was looking for it.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:26.433
He called himself Francis,
and Francis in the Church

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:30.753
is someone who looked for God
amidst 10-cent coins.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.970
Someone who looked for God
among the poor, where there was nothing.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.970
Someone who descended
from the pedestal of wealth and majesty

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.950
to find God among the poor
as the poorest one.

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:48.952
I think that Pope Francis wants
to do the same thing.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.540
He showed it by that gesture,
he bent down to look for 10 cents.

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:57.359
If in Church, and especially outside
the Church,

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:02.858
there are people who are worth
10 cents or even less,

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:08.521
Pope Francis, I believe, will spend
his pontificate, hope he will live long,

00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:10.440
on looking for those 10 cents coins.

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.256
And if he finds one, I suppose,
he will invite the whole Church

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:18.515
and will prepare a great celebration
because he found ten cents.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.747
I would like to ask you to pray intensely
for the new pope Francis,

00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:27.361
because it is a wonderful configuration:

00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:31.865
a Jesuit in Dominican’s habit
and with Franciscan’s name.

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:37.273
The strongest powers of the Church have
come together to put everything in order.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.392
What is going to happen will be
an amazing, heavenly ride.

00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:46.073
What is going to happen right now
will be a great blessing

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.332
prepared by God for us
for this time.

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:51.516
I believe that the Church
really needs this.

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:56.800
Let’s pray for our new, wonderful,
given by God Pope Francis.

00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:02.529
Let’s ask for him to fulfil his mission
and find all ten cents coins.
