Brainard's concern 50 raids last time
and<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.900> instance

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and there were there would be instance

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
and there were there would be instance
where<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.619> agree<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.210> should

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
where I actually agree that we should

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.039 
where I actually agree that we should
take<00:01:12.570> action<00:01:12.780> locally<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.810> there<00:01:15.810> are

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
take action locally first but there are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.760 
take action locally first but there are
not<00:01:16.290> any<00:01:16.939> CAFO<00:01:17.939> operations<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.810> georgetown<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
not any CAFO operations in georgetown so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.260 
not any CAFO operations in georgetown so
for<00:01:19.950> us<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> within<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> city

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
for us to just say it within the city

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:40.330 
for us to just say it within the city
limits<00:01:31.310> would<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.549> empty<00:01:32.700> gesture<00:01:33.479> oh<00:01:35.570> so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.219 

also<00:01:41.340> these<00:01:41.490> diseases<00:01:44.869> don't<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:46.049> any

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
also these diseases don't know any

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950 
also these diseases don't know any
boundaries<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> state-by-state<00:01:48.509> approach

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
boundaries so a state-by-state approach

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.109 
boundaries so a state-by-state approach
would<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.220> mean<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:56.119> therapy

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
would just mean that the therapy

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.240 
would just mean that the therapy
clusters<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.170> disease<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> would<00:02:00.979> go<00:02:01.979> across

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
clusters of disease that would go across

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
clusters of disease that would go across
the<00:02:02.790> border<00:02:03.210> anyways<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> stop

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the border anyways I'm going to stop

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.170 
the border anyways I'm going to stop
talking<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.070> ask<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.759> give<00:02:05.969> this

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
talking now and ask that you give this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
talking now and ask that you give this
serious<00:02:06.570> consideration<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.680> approve<00:02:08.129> this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
serious consideration and approve this

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.610 
serious consideration and approve this
resolution
