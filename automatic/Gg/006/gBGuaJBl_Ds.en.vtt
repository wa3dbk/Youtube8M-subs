dual video series it has been tweaked
and<00:00:49.340> modified<00:00:49.780> since<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.960> originally<00:00:51.350> did

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
and modified since we originally did

filmed those videos but this deck is
still<00:00:55.220> pretty<00:00:55.880> close<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:56.330> one<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:56.780> just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
still pretty close to that one it's just

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.530 
still pretty close to that one it's just
slightly<00:00:58.310> better<00:00:58.520> more<00:00:58.820> consistent<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.390> guess

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
originally I think we only had one or
two<00:02:31.820> Effect<00:02:32.240> Veiler<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.720> deck<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.140> having

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
two Effect Veiler in the deck but having

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.080

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
three really makes the deck a little bit

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.250 
three really makes the deck a little bit
more<00:02:35.240> consistent<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.810> get<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.140> effect

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
more consistent you get that effect

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.780

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
it that way you can don't have to worry

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
it that way you can don't have to worry
about<00:02:39.560> your<00:02:40.460> general<00:02:40.730> khattala<00:02:41.090> being<00:02:41.360> out

them<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.190> little<00:02:43.430> better<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.850> think<00:02:43.910> that

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
them a little better and I think that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.030 
them a little better and I think that
really<00:02:44.330> helps<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> deck<00:02:44.900> out<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.080> lot<00:02:45.320> all

Pryor again kind of puts them in a

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.810 
Pryor again kind of puts them in a
little<00:06:50.810> bit<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:50.990> a<00:06:51.080> loop<00:06:51.290> trap<00:06:51.740> so<00:06:52.580> they<00:06:52.670> have

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
little bit of a loop trap so they have

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.040 
little bit of a loop trap so they have
to<00:06:52.940> find<00:06:53.120> a<00:06:53.210> way<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.390> get<00:06:53.570> rid<00:06:53.660> of<00:06:53.720> actually

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
to find a way to get rid of actually

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.110 
to find a way to get rid of actually
both<00:06:54.290> cards<00:06:54.800> and<00:06:55.010> then<00:06:55.520> there's<00:06:55.730> a<00:06:55.790> lot<00:06:56.000> of

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
both cards and then there's a lot of

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.150 
both cards and then there's a lot of
recursion<00:06:56.420> in<00:06:56.780> this<00:06:56.990> deck<00:06:57.230> so<00:06:57.680> even<00:06:57.890> assuming

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
recursion in this deck so even assuming

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.050 
recursion in this deck so even assuming
they<00:06:58.250> get<00:06:58.310> rid<00:06:58.460> of<00:06:58.520> both<00:06:58.670> of<00:06:58.790> them<00:06:58.880> you<00:06:58.970> could

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
they get rid of both of them you could

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.360 
they get rid of both of them you could
play<00:06:59.210> something<00:06:59.450> like<00:06:59.600> surface<00:07:00.320> go<00:07:00.920> ahead<00:07:01.130> and

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
play something like surface go ahead and

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.500 
play something like surface go ahead and
special<00:07:01.670> something<00:07:01.880> back<00:07:02.030> out<00:07:02.210> your<00:07:02.330> prior

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
special something back out your prior

special something back out your prior
should<00:07:03.110> beat<00:07:03.230> them<00:07:03.350> again<00:07:03.440> bring<00:07:04.220> back<00:07:04.340> out

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
should beat them again bring back out

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.040 
should beat them again bring back out
gun<00:07:04.610> Tala<00:07:04.820> bring<00:07:05.090> back<00:07:05.240> out<00:07:05.390> your<00:07:05.510> prior<00:07:05.720> and

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
gun Tala bring back out your prior and

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.750 
gun Tala bring back out your prior and
just<00:07:06.350> start<00:07:06.500> the<00:07:06.620> whole<00:07:06.770> chain<00:07:07.040> loop<00:07:07.250> all<00:07:07.460> over

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
just start the whole chain loop all over

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.270 
just start the whole chain loop all over
again<00:07:07.850> we<00:07:08.660> also<00:07:08.810> have<00:07:09.080> stuff<00:07:09.380> like<00:07:09.500> Salvage<00:07:10.100> in

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
again we also have stuff like Salvage in

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.860 
again we also have stuff like Salvage in
the<00:07:10.370> day<00:07:10.490> to<00:07:10.700> help<00:07:10.820> getting<00:07:11.270> back<00:07:11.300> your<00:07:11.480> prior

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
again and with two services to salvages

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.750 
again and with two services to salvages
and<00:07:18.140> three<00:07:18.710> priors<00:07:18.950> in<00:07:19.130> the<00:07:19.190> deck<00:07:19.340> with<00:07:19.550> three
