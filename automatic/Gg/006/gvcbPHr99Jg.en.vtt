00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
no sense to you then you really should

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.680 
no sense to you then you really should
just<00:02:21.890> stop<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.310> video<00:02:22.520> right<00:02:22.910> now<00:02:22.970> go<00:02:23.630> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
just stop this video right now go to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.310 
just stop this video right now go to
tornado<00:02:24.170> twins<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:25.150> some<00:02:26.150> other<00:02:26.320> tutorial

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
tornado twins or some other tutorial

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.620 
tornado twins or some other tutorial
series<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.920> may<00:02:28.010> find<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.670> check<00:02:29.480> those

out first and then come back here so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.410 
out first and then come back here so
that<00:02:34.310> when<00:02:34.490> they<00:02:34.610> say<00:02:34.820> something<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:35.300> one<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that when they say something in one of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.970 
that when they say something in one of
those<00:02:35.540> tutorial<00:02:36.110> series<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> won't

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
those tutorial series that you won't

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.010 
those tutorial series that you won't
necessarily<00:02:37.190> understand<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.720> come<00:02:38.900> back

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
necessarily understand you can come back

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.150 
necessarily understand you can come back
here<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.350> I'll<00:02:39.560> give<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.860> all<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> details

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
here and I'll give you all the details

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.560 
here and I'll give you all the details
and<00:02:40.790> explain<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.870> functioning<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:43.330> how<00:02:44.330> all

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and explain the functioning of how all

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.390 
and explain the functioning of how all
those<00:02:44.780> things<00:02:45.080> work<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.010> next<00:02:46.100> couple

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
those things work in the next couple

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.250 
those things work in the next couple
episodes<00:02:46.880> we're<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.570> go<00:02:47.690> over<00:02:47.720> unity

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
episodes we're going to go over unity

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.190 
episodes we're going to go over unity
script<00:02:48.740> reference<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:50.390> basics<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:51.080> how

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
script reference and the basics of how

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.540 
script reference and the basics of how
variables<00:02:52.070> functions<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.760> classes<00:02:53.209> work

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
variables functions and classes work

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.040 
variables functions and classes work
then<00:02:55.550> we're<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.940> go<00:02:56.120> over<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.570> basics

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
then we're going to go over the basics

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.410 
then we're going to go over the basics
of<00:02:57.260> what<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> transform<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.090> how<00:02:59.240> it<00:02:59.390> works

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
of what a transform is and how it works

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.410 
of what a transform is and how it works
and<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.410> vector<00:03:00.620> 3<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.459> then<00:03:01.670> quaternions

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
and then vector 3 and then quaternions

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.120 
and then vector 3 and then quaternions
all<00:03:02.900> right<00:03:02.990> then<00:03:03.290> after<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.770> we're<00:03:03.980> going<00:03:04.070> to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
all right then after that we're going to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.860 
all right then after that we're going to
go<00:03:04.310> over<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.490> couple<00:03:04.670> functions<00:03:05.300> from<00:03:05.570> all

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
go over a couple functions from all

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.230 
go over a couple functions from all
around<00:03:05.990> unity<00:03:06.560> script<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.550> are<00:03:07.790> some<00:03:08.120> of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
around unity script there are some of

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.670 
around unity script there are some of
the<00:03:08.300> most<00:03:08.420> useful<00:03:08.660> functions<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.530> you're

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
the most useful functions that you're

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
the most useful functions that you're
going<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.830> be<00:03:09.920> using<00:03:10.520> more<00:03:10.880> often<00:03:11.300> than<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:11.510> to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
going to be using more often than not to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.310 
going to be using more often than not to
