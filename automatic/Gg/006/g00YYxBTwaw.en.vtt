00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.860

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.409

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.870

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 case you deserve it good for the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 good sermons good friends from youtube 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 As my avatar will have already realized 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.690
 female is metal edge slug hello 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 friends of youtube I'm loose the one 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.000
 we do well and all that web that is 3 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.310
 good friends are asking 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.440
 what I still do not know what spears hates 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 well I was doing it and I took a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.120
 I breathe and I took advantage of making this video 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.860
 I also believe that I will upload several videos 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.350
 before the respite day since it will be 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.870
 quite because the most fixed story 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.060
 more stuffing like a long video and I think 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.220
 that will have two parts you believe but hates 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.250
 but we skip the subject 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.410
 let's start this top at once I think 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.160
 is the most original top of all the story 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.160
 city xd 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.750
 - and look like marijuana and it ends with 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.230
 the music for damn control works 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.230
 works 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.440
 work but the only thing that happens is high 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.510
 because you curse the cobra control of the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.150
 television because the control I know what 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.459
 I try to stop the music and go on and on 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.350
 I do not know how not to see the control pass 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.530
 because you do not know those things 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.890
 I also know if I do not know less but 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.990
 how was that I can not believe it good 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.800
 I loosen it but what you talk about is not a 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.320
 flask 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.770
 but good still with the good top in the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.930
 put 10 is this is fucked control 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.600
 with the video 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.630
 Fuck ya with the fucking video a good 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.640
 time is now what happens is the control 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.000
 I try to put the video and it does not appear 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.880
 nothing to have tried you good there is 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.040
 but how the fuck does it good we start 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.470
 the top in the tenth place is rock 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.660
 Danish controls I'll give you a little 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.670
 of information of this game because if 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.220
 I give a lot to those who have not yet 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.150
 they play they are going to complain well let's start 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.460
 in the year 200 x the robo ro a project 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.650
 of doctor thomas light was created 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.500
 later in series was created to its 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.560
 sisters role together with others 86 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.690
 originally working brothers 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.960
 this was an era in which humans 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.150
 they lived together with the robots without 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.460
 However the doctor light's rival 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.440
 Dr. Willy rebelled and took the 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.630
 creations of the doctor dick for his 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.810
 own use leaving behind the useless 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.669
 robots rock and roll the reprogrammed those 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.220
 robots and he used them in a navy to 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.950
 conquer the world so when the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.960
 things looked really bad rock was offered 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.110
 as a volunteer to be converted into 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.810
 a fighting robot in this way he 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.300
 came back known as good megaman the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.850
 soundtrack are very good although the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.460
 music sometimes repeats itself and that's a 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.650
 little annoying but of all good 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.990
 why 18 good is the difficulty is 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.870
 great for you to just play but good 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.970
 I put a 7 because I already got used to it 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.220
 well the quality of one's game is not 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.860
 could put a lot in Danish but what 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.200
 well the other reason is because I put it in 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.600
 this position is because it was the first 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.360
 classic megaman game that pass good 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.740
 9 since it will trust hour monitoring 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.740
 shit works
