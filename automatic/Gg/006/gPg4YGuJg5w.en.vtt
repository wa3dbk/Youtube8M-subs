pretty standard nothing more than be

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.210 
pretty standard nothing more than be
reasonable<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.080> snow<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.770> back<00:03:10.980> tail

reasonable for the snow the back tail

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.130 
reasonable for the snow the back tail
here<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> rubbery<00:03:12.030> plastic<00:03:12.270> material<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
here is a rubbery plastic material that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.300 
here is a rubbery plastic material that
looks<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.560> it'll<00:03:13.770> have<00:03:13.890> some<00:03:14.040> articulation

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
looks like it'll have some articulation

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.820 
looks like it'll have some articulation
but<00:03:14.820> really<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.360> limited<00:03:16.110> it's<00:03:16.320> basically

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
but really it's limited it's basically

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.770 
but really it's limited it's basically
just<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.250> rubber<00:03:17.460> value<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.270> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.480> bend<00:03:18.660> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
just the rubber value but if you bend it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 
just the rubber value but if you bend it
too<00:03:18.900> much<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.080> going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> stick<00:03:19.680> anyway<00:03:20.040> echo

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
too much just going to stick anyway echo

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.940 
too much just going to stick anyway echo
here<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.390> just<00:03:21.660> exactly<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.290> same<00:03:22.500> got<00:03:22.800> some
