 hello everybody is starting now a long time brazil with the forecast of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.090
 time for this weekend promises to be well chilled in the region are is 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.790
 unstable weather 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.970
 there is this cold front that is already in the southern region 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.599
 was responsible for rainfall 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.640
 and also do not think well loaded 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 safin as this cold front advances it will cause rainfall in the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.220
 southeast 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.399
 and in the southern region the weather starts to open and a new polar air mass goes 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.069
 bring down the temperatures 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.409
 only in the early hours of Saturday we will still have areas of instability 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.420
 mainly in the eastern part of the region and in the Rio Grande and 

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.359
 instabilities combined with cold 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.170
 conditions for wood 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.910
 in the region so there you will do a lot of 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.910
 It will be quite cold in the whole south. 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.940
 temperatures of only 5 degrees in merry port I have is even higher in the mountains 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.960
 and also in the campaign of the great river of the south already in the Southeast and Center-West or 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 cold takes a little longer for the arrival 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.420
 on Sunday is that temperatures should drop more 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.240

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.270
 brasília 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.429
 the time gets more muffled in the light as the collector is 16 degrees at the beginning of 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.090
 Saturday in manaus in maceió the minimum temperature around 19 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.319
 degrees and in the course of the Sabbath as the cold front advances it will bring 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.219
 rains for good part of são paulo south of minas gerais' and south of rio de janeiro 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.520
 in addition this same cold front causes rains in part of the thick mato 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 and continued to maintain unstable time in part of the paraná and also 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 in the extreme north-east of santa catarina, mainly in the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.979
 inside the south region time back open here we will have dry weather in great 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.560

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.719
 isolated especially that I think of thick bush 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.150
 also rononia to tim a amazonastur in roraima 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.340
 this literature select large part of the country why this polar air mass per 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.360
 while lava reaching us mostly in the southern region I need on Saturday 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.640
 the cold is more restricted in this region and also in part of the southern thicket 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.200
 reaching the south of são paulo, this maxim is only as if degrees in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.730
 porto alegre already here in the center-west in darcy cinema time much more muffled to 32 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.899
 degrees in brasilia 36 degrees in manaus-- 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.060
 and 28 degrees in maceió al 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 in Sao Paulo as it has pulled should be more unstable on Saturday the temperature 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.369
 it will not go up so much is to stay around the 3 3 degrees 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.309
 and on Sunday the rains lose some intensity the cold front begins to 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:55.119
 to get away and cause more rain here on the rest of São Paulo I'm from 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.319
 minasgerais rio de janeiro and also has leftovers between the holy spirit and extreme 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.100
 south 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.959
 in the bay but the people 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.099
 although persist throughout the day will be low accumulated already in good 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.120
 part of the southern region in the mid-west in the northeast dry weather will predominate and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.150
 in the north region we will have rain showers especially in the Amazon 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.420
 the weariness of the trip was a little intensity 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.390
 and then risks to heavy rain it rains still in the north end of the region a 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.870
 more isolated strokes 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.790
 the site of the work tries by mistake on Monday with more forecast of the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.360
