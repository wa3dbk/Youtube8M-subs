mount a for your tripod it's kind of
offset<00:02:00.560> compared<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.310> where<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.149> it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
offset compared to where it is so it's

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.529 
offset compared to where it is so it's
there's<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.200> gear<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.530> here<00:02:03.679> that's<00:02:04.539> turning

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.380 

open<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.739> your<00:02:12.920> 60<00:02:13.540> there's<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.840> little<00:02:16.390> lever

open up your 60 there's a little lever

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.789 
open up your 60 there's a little lever
right<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:18.459> pull<00:02:19.459> on<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:21.349> door<00:02:21.560> comes

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
off the door locks into the battery grip

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:38.430 
off the door locks into the battery grip
and<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:30.160> has<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.430> same<00:02:33.880> locking<00:02:34.880> s<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:37.010> camera

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
and it has the same locking s the camera

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.610 
and it has the same locking s the camera
and<00:02:38.830> then<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.480> lock<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.690> down<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.380> don't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
and then you can lock it down so I don't

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.270 
and then you can lock it down so I don't
come<00:02:41.800> off<00:02:43.200> put<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> camera<00:02:44.920> just

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
come off put it on to the camera just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.620 
come off put it on to the camera just
slide<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:48.100> right<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:52.240> gear<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
slide this in the right way and gear it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.100 
slide this in the right way and gear it
in<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> plastic<00:02:54.240> overall<00:02:55.240> review<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.930> this

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
in so the plastic overall review on this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.340 
in so the plastic overall review on this
the<00:02:56.800> plastic<00:02:57.340> matches<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.600> color<00:02:58.840> matches

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the plastic matches the color matches

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.970 
the plastic matches the color matches
the<00:03:00.280> rubber<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.740> color<00:03:02.740> wise

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the rubber on this and this color wise

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.830 
the rubber on this and this color wise
matches<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> lot<00:03:05.380> softer<00:03:06.840> more

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
matches but this is a lot softer more

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.280 
matches but this is a lot softer more
pliable<00:03:08.080> than<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:12.150> overall<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.900> big

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
pliable than this overall it's a big

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.420 
pliable than this overall it's a big
grip<00:03:19.020> if<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.080> look<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.830> side<00:03:21.100> it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
grip if you look on this side it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.580 
grip if you look on this side it
protrudes<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.800> has<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.940> foot<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:29.320> if<00:03:29.440> you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
protrudes back and has a foot so if you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.910 
protrudes back and has a foot so if you
have<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.800> small<00:03:30.400> hand<00:03:30.700> this<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.930> probably<00:03:32.710> not

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
have a small hand this is probably not

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.980 
have a small hand this is probably not
the<00:03:33.390> best<00:03:34.390> grip<00:03:35.140> for<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:37.060> probably<00:03:37.450> made

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
the best grip for you it's probably made

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.070 
the best grip for you it's probably made
to<00:03:38.260> can<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.740> standard<00:03:39.460> so<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.840> know<00:03:41.020> if

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
to can and standard so I don't know if

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.440 
to can and standard so I don't know if
they<00:03:41.320> make<00:03:41.590> anything<00:03:42.040> smaller<00:03:42.370> than<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.820> but

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
they make anything smaller than this but

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.199 
they make anything smaller than this but
it<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.810> fairly<00:03:44.170> large<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.400> need<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.580> big<00:03:45.850> hand

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
it is fairly large you need a big hand

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.930 
it is fairly large you need a big hand
to<00:03:46.390> hold<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:48.190> when<00:03:48.310> you're<00:03:48.430> holding<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
it is comfortable it does add a lot of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
it is comfortable it does add a lot of
weight<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.760> camera<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.330> camera<00:03:58.390> is<00:03:58.840> a

weight to this camera this camera is a

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.770 
weight to this camera this camera is a
fairly<00:03:59.290> heavy<00:03:59.770> camera<00:04:00.160> already<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.450> with<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
fairly heavy camera already so with the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.580 
fairly heavy camera already so with the
two<00:04:01.959> battery<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.920> battery<00:04:02.950> grip<00:04:04.590> makes

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
two battery and the battery grip makes

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.910 
two battery and the battery grip makes
it<00:04:05.740> very<00:04:05.950> substantial<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.650> lens<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.810> 60d

it very substantial the lens on this 60d

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it very substantial the lens on this 60d
6d<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:13.260> pretty<00:04:14.260> heavy<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> overall<00:04:15.790> this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
6d is pretty heavy so the overall this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.599 
6d is pretty heavy so the overall this
camera<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.560> good<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.770> feels<00:04:17.919> like<00:04:18.160> four<00:04:18.400> pounds

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
camera is good it feels like four pounds

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.340 
camera is good it feels like four pounds
or<00:04:18.970> something<00:04:19.299> here<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:20.380> could<00:04:21.130> be<00:04:21.220> wrong<00:04:21.400> but

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.950 

on<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.410> normal<00:04:26.800> day<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.520> don't<00:04:27.760> leave<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
on a normal day I don't leave this on I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.530 
on a normal day I don't leave this on I
only<00:04:29.560> leave<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.400> if<00:04:30.610> I'm<00:04:30.760> going<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:30.970> do<00:04:31.150> like

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
only leave it on if I'm going to do like

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.250 
only leave it on if I'm going to do like
a<00:04:31.600> shoot<00:04:32.470> or<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> lot<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.180> videos<00:04:34.600> then<00:04:35.140> I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
a shoot or do a lot of videos then I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.100 
a shoot or do a lot of videos then I
leave<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.669> otherwise<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.540> comes<00:04:37.870> off

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
leave that on but otherwise it comes off

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.610 
leave that on but otherwise it comes off
on<00:04:38.350> daily<00:04:39.100> uses<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.940> don't<00:04:40.690> really<00:04:41.200> use<00:04:41.440> it

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
on daily uses I don't really use it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
on daily uses I don't really use it
because<00:04:41.770> it's<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.970> hard<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.419> store<00:04:43.630> in

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
because it's just it's hard to store in

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.210 
because it's just it's hard to store in
my<00:04:43.930> camera<00:04:44.169> bag<00:04:44.290> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
my camera bag and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.620 
my camera bag and
it<00:04:46.790> just<00:04:48.520> makes<00:04:49.520> a<00:04:49.640> whole<00:04:49.760> camera<00:04:50.000> very<00:04:50.270> heavy

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
it just makes a whole camera very heavy

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.700 
it just makes a whole camera very heavy
to<00:04:51.080> use<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:53.050> if<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.200> don't<00:04:54.350> do<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.470> lot<00:04:54.680> of

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
to use so if you don't do a lot of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.710 
to use so if you don't do a lot of
videos<00:04:56.560> if<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.770> don't<00:05:00.280> shoot<00:05:01.480> six<00:05:02.480> seven

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
videos if you don't shoot six seven

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.610 
videos if you don't shoot six seven
hundred<00:05:02.920> shots<00:05:03.920> at<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.340> time<00:05:05.260> then<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.380> wouldn't

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
hundred shots at a time then I wouldn't

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.270 
hundred shots at a time then I wouldn't
recommend<00:05:06.920> this<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.540> is<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:09.280> cheap

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280
