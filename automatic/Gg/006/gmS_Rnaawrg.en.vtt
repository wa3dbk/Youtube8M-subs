00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
actually like I just see this first year

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
actually like I just see this first year
was<00:02:21.510> pretty<00:02:21.990> damn<00:02:22.470> epic<00:02:22.770> he<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.460> like

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
was pretty damn epic he was like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000 
was pretty damn epic he was like
literally<00:02:24.090> fool<00:02:24.540> he<00:02:25.260> only<00:02:25.440> had<00:02:25.590> three<00:02:25.800> food

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
literally fool he only had three food

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040 
literally fool he only had three food
left<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.240> basically<00:02:27.690> three

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
left so like that's basically three

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.950 
left so like that's basically three
inventory<00:02:28.470> sports<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.690> yeah<00:02:30.840> that's

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
inventory sports I think so yeah that's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.230 
inventory sports I think so yeah that's
the<00:02:31.170> great<00:02:31.980> kill<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.520> there<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:32.850> I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the great kill right there I think I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.630 
the great kill right there I think I
believe<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.170> 40<00:02:34.650> k<00:02:34.800> or<00:02:35.010> something<00:02:35.430> in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
believe that's like 40 k or something in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 
believe that's like 40 k or something in
one<00:02:35.910> drop<00:02:36.150> right<00:02:36.390> there<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.290> get<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
one drop right there and if you get that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.370 
one drop right there and if you get that
often<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:38.580> yeah<00:02:39.240> you're<00:02:39.420> gonna<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.870> rich<00:02:40.110> in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
often then yeah you're gonna be rich in

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.400 
often then yeah you're gonna be rich in
no<00:02:40.410> time<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.180> did<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.900> while<00:02:42.990> and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
no time so I did that for a while and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.810 
no time so I did that for a while and
