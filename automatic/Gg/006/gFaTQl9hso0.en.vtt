00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 The video thing is that I gave ct this 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 centralized testing if anyone 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.040

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.790
 type of Russian food something like that and 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 finally i finally passed all 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.160
 exams and now i'm free to freedom 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 I have a lot of free time but not so 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.649
 much that there is still much to do except 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.270
 studies and which are no longer practical and 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.930
 actually all zashib everything is simple 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 perfectly 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.879
 if you are interested in principle but 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980
 the most important thing lies ahead is very 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 a lot of interesting things and today we 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 splendid holiday just 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.850
 the wonderful thing is that we have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.850
 channel 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.110
 5000 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.299
 five thousand subscribers and it's just 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.010
 zashib because well this is unrealistic for 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.479
 me this is not really this such 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.710
 never with me was naturally not 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.680
 was there eliminate i didn't have that much 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.240
 subscribers actually this very 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.850
 a lot because when you present 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.070
 that before you is 5000 people this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.740
 it is unreal it is like at concerts 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.200

 Of course, not everyone writes adequate and so 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 people who write inadequate i'm not 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 such that enrages infuriates simply and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.050
 distract and interfere with my work every day 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.110
 message arrives that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.920
 sound like hello I don't answer them 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580
 of course 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.300
 well sense sense to answer this but also 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.319
 there is a message like how are you -ah-ah-ah what 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.709
 friends if you need someone 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.870
 chat with someone if you want 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 more communication then you can communicate 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.270
 each other and with someone you 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.690

 girl at least there or couples nobody in this 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.770
 I do not know and everything will hurt me to write 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.379
 it is not necessary that there be arranged like mine 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 things like my life is not necessary but 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.330
 seriously don't need it just not to me 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.040
 because to me it is from uninteresting not 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.410
 interested to answer do not answer 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 such messages in general 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.250
 Actually, I am grateful to all those who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.200
 I was supported all this time and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.980
 and we are ahead and in two weeks 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.020
 somewhere another holidays well what 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.900
 you may guess, and may be 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.830
 no but let's see let's see it is not 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.680
 it doesn't matter 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.930
 actually there is still news 1 one such 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.920
 one single news that you 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.970
 may not like 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.320
 the thing is, I'm tired of minecraft 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.500
 and no matter how silly it sounds for the whole 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.560
 almost a year almost a year attention 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.200
 stuff b'lieve i'm tired i'm tired of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.090
 this shit I 'll close the trembled simple 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040
 I would play with pleasure if 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.780
 Only not these lags I have a powerful computer 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.270
 in maykravt not pulls you understand it 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.400
 horror, horror will turn out just utter but 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.360
 the thing is, I'm not going to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 finish shooting minecraft because 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.590
 because once I have a new 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
 iron or minecraft optimizes 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.680
 finally son who knows what can 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.650
 happen and then I can play 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.420
 ok mind game and by record and here 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.620
 it'll be zashib just so for now 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.250
 we set a little bit of our learning 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.880
 survive 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.459
 Well, everything connected with it is such 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.690
 will sometimes go navy on and lance 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.130
 if you know what I'm talking about and can 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.830
 sometime mine will be vidos 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.350
 but not now will not learn 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.710
 it will be possible to survive the dam 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.080
 that is, in fact, I see a look 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.310
 I think that this summer will be a lot of games 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.410
 different games 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.440

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.900
