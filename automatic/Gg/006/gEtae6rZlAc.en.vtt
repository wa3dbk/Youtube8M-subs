00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
edges it's nice it was basically exactly

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.150 
edges it's nice it was basically exactly
the<00:00:22.410> same<00:00:22.619> size<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:24.140> insulation<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the same size as the insulation so I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:37.270 
the same size as the insulation so I
didn't<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> cut<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:28.080> piece<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.650> all

head up here and i'll show you my my
little<00:01:07.679> plans<00:01:08.039> for<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:13.530> basically

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
little plans for this it's basically

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.180 
little plans for this it's basically
what<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.160> looked<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> i<00:01:16.560> measured<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
what it looked like and so i measured in

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.570 
what it looked like and so i measured in
from<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> edge<00:01:17.910> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.149> plywood<00:01:19.580> for

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
from the edge of the plywood for

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.820 
from the edge of the plywood for
instance<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.600> inches<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.289> right<00:01:22.470> side

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
instance five inches on the right side

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
instance five inches on the right side
now<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.100> left<00:01:26.369> side<00:01:26.580> five<00:01:26.940> inches<00:01:27.210> on

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
now this is the left side five inches on

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.850 
now this is the left side five inches on
the<00:01:27.450> left<00:01:27.600> side<00:01:27.750> five<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> half<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the left side five and a half on the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
the left side five and a half on the
right<00:01:29.009> side<00:01:29.310> eight<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> half<00:01:30.300> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> right

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

you can't see it too well in the video
but<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.830> would<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:47.490> looks<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.880> nice

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
could just cut out strips of wood or I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.200 
could just cut out strips of wood or I
could<00:01:58.730> do<00:01:59.730> something<00:01:59.760> else
