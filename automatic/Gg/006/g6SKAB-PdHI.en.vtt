another chance for a long time and it

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
another chance for a long time and it
will<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.209> outdated<00:03:58.660> if<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.049> do<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.320> any

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
at this point it's going to be there and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.950 
at this point it's going to be there and
whichever<00:04:31.060> one<00:04:31.300> gets<00:04:31.330> picked<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.750> or

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
whichever one gets picked on or

streaming<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.470> its<00:04:32.680> entirety<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:33.700> much<00:04:34.060> as<00:04:34.180> I

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
streaming in its entirety as much as I

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.390 
streaming in its entirety as much as I
can<00:04:34.330> anyways<00:04:35.110> if<00:04:35.350> it's<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.590> longer<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.190> I

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
can anyways if it's a longer in that I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.159 
can anyways if it's a longer in that I
might<00:04:36.610> not<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:37.000> through<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> all<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:38.020> one

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
might not get through it all in the one

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.400 
might not get through it all in the one
stream<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.120> I'm<00:04:40.120> gonna<00:04:40.300> try<00:04:40.600> my<00:04:40.630> best<00:04:41.050> and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
stream but I'm gonna try my best and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.830 
stream but I'm gonna try my best and
hopefully<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:42.639> won't<00:04:42.789> be<00:04:42.880> super<00:04:43.240> redundant

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
hopefully it won't be super redundant

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.690 
hopefully it won't be super redundant
because<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.200> like<00:04:44.380> oh<00:04:44.680> you're<00:04:45.400> doing<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
because it's like oh you're doing the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.210 
because it's like oh you're doing the
same<00:04:45.880> game<00:04:46.150> again<00:04:46.539> yeah<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.770> I'm<00:04:47.919> not<00:04:48.070> like

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
same game again yeah but I'm not like

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.860 
same game again yeah but I'm not like
uploading<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.000> my<00:04:49.120> youtube<00:04:49.510> channel<00:04:49.539> or

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
uploading it to my youtube channel or

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.390 
uploading it to my youtube channel or
anything<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.260> it's<00:04:50.320> not<00:04:50.470> really<00:04:50.530> super

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
anything so it's not really super

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.310 
anything so it's not really super
redundant<00:04:51.910> but<00:04:52.500> no

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
redundant but no

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.170 
redundant but no
