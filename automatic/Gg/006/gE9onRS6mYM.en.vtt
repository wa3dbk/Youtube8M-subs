00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.130
 smartphone at ces in las vegas and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 actually from here we take our 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299

 this is sony xperia z 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.100
 This unit is unique both in its 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
 characteristics so by their design and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the design I first want 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 tell the company applied new 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 approach to building design build 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.110
 apparatus that called me balance and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120
 which tells us that with whatever 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 parties you did not look at the smartphone he 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 will look you about the same and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.129
 look beautiful on all sides 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 Carefully front panel with us 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 busy mostly big screen here 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.480
 5 inch full hd display is very bright and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.729
 very clear its resolution is 443 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.700
 pixels per inch and the brightness is 500 candles 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.460
 per square meter respectively 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 a large and very beautiful display with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.830
 the display has two key 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 technology that we have already applied for 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 separately in our different models this 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 technology new rg which cleans up 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 air gap between the matrix and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.600
 proper protective glass and technology 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 sensor he lance which says that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 sensor the sensor layer is applied on itself on 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 protective glass itself as a result of these 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 two technologies combined gives you a very 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.000
 bright and good screen with large angles 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 review and best of all he 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.870
 does not fade in the bright sun that is, he 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.910
 visible in any condition + on the front 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.820
 we have a camera on the side of the phone 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.240
 here is a 2 megapixel camera with a matrix 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.130
 exmor r which allows you to shoot 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 video and even well own photos at 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.479
 bad lighting conditions here we have 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.330
 on top there are two sensors this sensor 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.630
 proximity and light sensor and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.459
 bottom here is on with you main 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.510
 microphone but from above naturally main 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.100
 speaker on the right side of the device we 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 you see the on / off button 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.020
 the phone and transfer it to scan buy mode 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.820
 the button I draw your attention is made of 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 aluminum and made very very 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.350
 qualitatively like your own whole machine 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.270
 In general, in the development of this device with 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.250
 its manufacturing company announced 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.620
 special attention to the quality of performance 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 small details 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 affects the overall feeling of the device 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.420
 here we are with you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.510
 stub this stub under micro sim 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.540
 the card and here is the rocker 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.970
 volume controls that you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.040
 undoubtedly this slot is useful 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.070
 this is the speaker through which you own 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.100
 hear the external sound on the back side 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.450
 apparatus we see the inscription xperia 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.709
 naturally see with you 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.780
 peephole camera this camera is 13 megapixels 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.640
 made using exmor rs matrix 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.989
 This is a new development by sony 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 which was created specifically for 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.920
 use in mobile devices and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.410
 here we have with you a LED which 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.900
 responsible for the flash the camera has 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.829
 very interesting new features and so 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.260
 anime such as shooting video in 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.959
 hdr mode i.e. backlit 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.870
 for example on the background of a light window or on 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.010
 sunset background you still get 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.350
 very good shots 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.500
 I will remind earlier izeo.ru we were only in 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.150
 photo mode on the left side of the device we 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.900
 see with you two stubs this download 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.700
 plug under 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.900
 port m is very responsible for us 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.599
 actually it is a combined port which 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 combines micro lesbian and hdmi 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.310
 opportunities and next to it is 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.780
 plug for the portal under the micro card 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.040
 sd and if you look carefully you 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.079
 note that there are two 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.450
 pads that like us 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.720
 guessed serves to charge the machine 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.650
 through the docking station but about the docking station 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.659
 separately in the next review 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.069
 above we have a cap under 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.789
 which hides three and a half 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.389
 millimeter is our traditional port for 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.490
 connect headphones or headset 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.250
 As for the design, well, the phone 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.990
 undoubtedly beautiful and the phone is beautiful for 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.060
 bill of materials as i have 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.780
 said here we used aluminum 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.520
 and the panels themselves are all around vinegar 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.740
 front rear side 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.240
 It is protected and durable glass which 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.830
 gives the device the best premium look 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.510
 and very good quality sensations 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.180
 as for the internal stuffing apparatus 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.860
 here, too, everything is in its place and the company 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.639
 I tried to make the device the most 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.729
 functional for users very 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.620
 very pleasant what i am talking about first 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.250
 display to which has already been said on 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.400
 display 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.380
 the club itself is not so good if 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.669
 they complemented 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.949
 traditional sunni technologies such 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.409
 like for example mobile took engine second 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.180
 generation here is engine which 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.400
 processes your photo and video 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.349
 image making them even clearer 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.849
 even more contrast more correctly 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.620
 exposes the colors and removing the extra noise 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.690
 here it all serves the processor 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.699
 this is the processor of one of the last 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.940
 generations here are qualcomm companies this 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.960
 snapdragon s4 pro 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.770
 quad core on each 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.919
 bucket floor 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.080
 one and a half gigahertz and at the same time we have the core 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.409
 all new cray architecture i.e. 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.880
 the device works very very quickly 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.969
 also allows him to work quickly 2 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.779
 gigov of RAM and immediately want 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.820
 note that 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.980
 internal memory 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.420
 there is also here 16 gigabytes 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.790
 onboard memory so how am i 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.040
 mentioned here there is a slot for micro sd 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.110
 all you can expand the memory which 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.770
 you need 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.560
 the machine will come to us on this jellybin 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:11.850
 version android 4.1 and after some 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.870
 time will get update to 4.2 and this is 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.390
 as for its core functions 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.510
 I want to note that all this is very 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.670
 beautiful design is a very powerful stuffing 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.930
 all this is packed in dustproof waterproof 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.360
 corps what you could already guess 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.090
 when looked at the stub that is 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.290
 our device is protected by protocol and 55 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.320
 and 57 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.110
 The device will appear in Russia in the first 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.050
 quarter of 2013 and it will be released in three 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:47.030
 colors it is black white and 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:49.410
 such a purple three colors 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.290
 will appear on our shelves 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.860
 soon thank you for your attention 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.860
 dating
