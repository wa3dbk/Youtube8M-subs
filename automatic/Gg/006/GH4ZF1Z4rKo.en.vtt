00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.540
 Hello everyone welcome to another video 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.690
 madrid mons this time I want 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.250
 teach them how I do the pacifiers 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.770
 or pacifiers for live babies in 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.190
 this time I have some pacifiers that 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.970
 I have not removed the plastic yet 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.000
 as well as these from here 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.030
 and I have these that I just did for 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.830
 Madrid 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.950
 As you can see, the magnet is very fixed 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.160
 and I have others that I have already 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.110
 removed the pacifier 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.739
 what I use to do these 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.350
 Pacifiers are a stiletto of preference 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.570
 a stiletto because scissors never go 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.120
 to get to the base 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.210
 to the base of the pacifier although it can be 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.320
 appreciate the protruding plastic and the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.480
 scissors what they are going to do is to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.460
 cut them a small space and what 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.950
 have to do after taking tweezers 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.079
 hold back to cut with scissors to 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.750
 me it's much better to cut with stiletto 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.309
 I do not think that it is more make a 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.770
 recommendation to be very careful 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.640
 next to the stiletto because we do not know 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.050
 what can happen and I use these magnets 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.130
 from here 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.920
 super magnets 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.450
 they are super super strong and the good is 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.710
 that as they have a coating 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.509
 silver 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 do not hurt the mouth of babies 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.470
 riva and here we have this here and for 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.940
 paste what I use is the silicone 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.040
 hot 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 here I have the pacifiers that I have already 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.580
 previously removed to those and that's it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.800
 The first thing that I recommend to you 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.540
 able to successfully cut a 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.970
 pacifier is to take the pacifier and download everything 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.670
 what they can to the plastic everything 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.830
 absolutely everything I can once 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.720
 lowered this for this is very important 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.659
 use both hands in this part of the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.759
 video no no I do not have both so it's that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.159
 I'll go by if you get off and around here 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.590
 just where the edge is placed 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.680
 the tip of the stylet in such a way that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.689
 the tip of the stiletto 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.300
 let's see with this that the tip of the 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.940
 stylet 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.590
 I got to this part of here it looks good 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.420
 how low it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.180
 once the pacifier is as low as 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.160
 possible put the tip of the stiletto 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 putting him in the gap between the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.590
 plastic and the plastic of the pacifier and 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.379
 only short 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.269
 then let's see how is this 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.269
 pacifier after that process 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.080
 ready as you see 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 here is the whole pacifier and if that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.519
 they lower everything 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.519
 you can see that it is cut 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.570
 and that's what they have to do 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.030
 around totally around equal 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.150
 way on the edge they lower it and it happens in 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.910
 the stiletto here get him down and they pass him 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.860
 the stylet to remove all the pacifier 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.860
 and then the only thing that remains is to paste 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.879
 ready as you see the soother no longer has 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.799
 totally disappeared and we can see 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.219
 that the plastic is totally clean 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.680
 without any plastic trace of the pacifier 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.590
 and up here as you see the cut is very 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.750
 clean and very rarely will there be a 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.790
 slight edge but that's fine since 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.459
 we have enough space to be able 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.489
 paste the magnet and now how we paste the 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.109
 magnet what they do not want is to stick in bad 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.480
 address and that does not serve the pacifier 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.350
 That's why the first thing I do is 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.069
 taste in the mouth of the beverly board 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.079
 in this case maddie if they see 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.450
 and once we see that the side is the 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.459
 right I know that this side of up here 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.420
 is where we are going to put a ball of 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.420
 hot silicone 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.800
 then they put the silicon ball 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.850
 hot and they press you 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.300
 to the magnet 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.870
 It is very important that you let them pass 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.390
 approximately four or five 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 hours and it's much better if they leave 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.180
 spend the whole night then let's see the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.720
 next process ready come they place a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.220
 silicon droplet good a drop 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.950
 considerably large on the side 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.020
 correct and crush and then it's ready 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.020
 to use we give you madrid 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.580
 ready as you see we have all 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.470
 with the magnet 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.590
 and then everyone likes to have a session 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.620
 you can try them just put it 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.129
 in the mouth of the new rival and ready glue 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 perfectly that would be all I hope that 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.860
 have any questions or have you 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
 question they let me know and I 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.199
 I will respond happy thank you for watching us 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.199
 we see
