00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.650
 Y 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 for this season we are going to have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.230
 we spent a bit the issue of metals and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.239
 the tachas that were very strong 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.400
 this winter they also spend this 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.160
 season always getting like the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.970
 details on the heels in the heels 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.489
 bright colors silver colors 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.440
 golden in a theme that always has a lot 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.449
 strength are the cakes all 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.129
 cakes in all kinds of shoes we are 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.920
 talking about pastel turquoise colors 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.290
 12 coral color comes in with a lot 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.300
 strength this season we have also 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.640
 another trend that is what refers to everything 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.710
 what are lace types are all 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.110
 shoes that have wicker weaves or 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.759
 tissue type member rather use 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.729
 that detail of the lace that is medium 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.619
 transparent to look more more standing and 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.960
 as we always have the trends 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.360
 classic summer that are floral 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.310
 which is why some ethnic issues 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.170
 basically those that are sandals france 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.759
 the good thing is that now this is no longer 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.160
 theme that you have not know what to wear 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.630
 all in one color or you have to have 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.250
 the wallet and shoes of the same color 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 so that you look good but now 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.590
 you can give yourself that luxury of being able to play 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.510
 mix combine and there is no longer a rule 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.640
 then the white the black now you 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.890
 you can make your own mixes and see 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.860
 what is best for you and what 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.590
 shoes nude tones or pastels are 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.540
 they adapt much more to this type of company 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.790
 more to combinations by colors 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.590
 a little neutral what is really everything 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.520
 depends a lot on the intention and use 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.869
 that you go to see the shoe 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 definitely any shoe with 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.020
 taco is going to stylize the figure is going to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.880
 make your legs look more 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.800
 long you will see much higher 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.510
 but for example if you do not know then you're going to 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.670
 leave in the morning in to walk what I know 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.729
 me and you want to generate that effect of 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.680
 length it is best to use 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.150
 wedges because they are shoes that give you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.239
 all the benefits of a taco but 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.940
 as it is a composite sole rests you 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.860
 much more the foot for a day to day 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.810
 you can use ballerinas you can use 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 flatts that in fact are much more 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.220
 comfortable or more versatile you can not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.910
 You can use it on the beach if you go 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 shopping are much more comfortable with 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.190
 with the straps to be very careful 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 because in fact if your calves a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 little chubby and you put on a shoe with 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.290
 ankle strap what he's going to do 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.319
 is to hang it then it's like 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.060
 a roll comes out and it does not look very good if 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.920
 your legs are short either 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 We recommend using the shoe with ring 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.069
 ankle because what it does is you 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.870
 short leg length what 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.209
 could you use is maybe some current 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.640
 on the instep with some nice detail 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.739
 if he wants to exist the shoe in 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.760
 all its splendor if you have legs 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.020
 long and thin 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.330
