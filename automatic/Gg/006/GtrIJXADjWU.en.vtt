00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.580 
take a picture and then you can adjust
the<00:02:26.980> angle<00:02:27.270> using<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.600> digitizer<00:02:29.110> stylus

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590

another<00:02:51.620> thing<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.100> can<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:53.000> using<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:54.050> OCR

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
another thing we can do is using the OCR

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.840 
another thing we can do is using the OCR
function<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:57.140> say<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.500> was<00:02:57.770> something<00:02:58.610> you

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
function so say this was something you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.220 
function so say this was something you
want<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> piece<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.420> your<00:02:59.540> email<00:02:59.900> or<00:03:00.080> something

want a piece on your email or something

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.810 
want a piece on your email or something
and<00:03:00.530> there<00:03:00.650> were<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:00.950> many<00:03:01.100> letters<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and there were so many letters that you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.270 
and there were so many letters that you
don't<00:03:02.330> want<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.570> type<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.900> what<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.710> can<00:03:03.890> do<00:03:04.070> is

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
don't want to type in what you can do is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.850 
don't want to type in what you can do is
use<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.850> character<00:03:05.390> recognition<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.620> then

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
use this character recognition and then

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.880 
use this character recognition and then
as<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.130> can<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.490> it's<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.420> detected<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.800> you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
as you can see it's all detected so you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.650 
as you can see it's all detected so you
can<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.220> copy<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.850> then<00:03:11.180> paste<00:03:11.210> it<00:03:11.570> directly

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
can just copy and then paste it directly

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.630 
can just copy and then paste it directly
to<00:03:12.110> email<00:03:12.500> as

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
to email as

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.820 
to email as
and<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.570> want<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.870> use<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.320> just<00:03:15.380> as

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
and then if you want to use this just as

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.640 
and then if you want to use this just as
an<00:03:16.010> image<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.570> bring<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.500> know

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.670 

and<00:03:22.690> then<00:03:22.930> for<00:03:23.170> example<00:03:23.260> say<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.100> was<00:03:24.340> sorry
