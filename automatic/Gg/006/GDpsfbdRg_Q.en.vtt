00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.430 
and read them on the go I tried doing
that<00:06:29.940> with<00:06:30.150> some<00:06:30.360> readers<00:06:30.570> on<00:06:30.870> Android<00:06:31.409> and

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
that with some readers on Android and

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.920 
that with some readers on Android and
the<00:06:31.949> screen<00:06:32.370> being<00:06:32.580> so<00:06:32.820> small<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.570> was<00:06:33.659> really

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
the screen being so small it was really

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.360 
the screen being so small it was really
difficult<00:06:34.110> for<00:06:34.409> it<00:06:34.620> to

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
difficult for it to

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.340 
difficult for it to
the<00:06:35.460> text<00:06:35.760> flow<00:06:35.880> properly<00:06:36.270> this<00:06:37.139> actually

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
the text flow properly this actually

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.140 
the text flow properly this actually
deals<00:06:37.740> with<00:06:37.919> it<00:06:38.040> really<00:06:38.340> really<00:06:38.520> well<00:06:38.729> as<00:06:38.970> long

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
deals with it really really well as long

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150 
deals with it really really well as long
as<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.360> PDF<00:06:39.720> isn't<00:06:40.169> that<00:06:40.440> doesn't<00:06:40.800> have<00:06:41.010> some

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
as the PDF isn't that doesn't have some

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.250 
as the PDF isn't that doesn't have some
sort<00:06:41.310> of<00:06:41.370> DRM<00:06:41.820> built<00:06:42.060> into<00:06:42.360> it<00:06:42.479> I<00:06:42.630> don't<00:06:43.169> know

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
sort of DRM built into it I don't know

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.110 
sort of DRM built into it I don't know
anything<00:06:43.410> about<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:43.680> other<00:06:44.520> than<00:06:44.699> that<00:06:44.970> it

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
anything about that other than that it

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.700 
anything about that other than that it
does<00:06:45.270> really<00:06:45.540> well<00:06:45.720> with<00:06:45.960> it<00:06:45.990> I<00:06:46.290> tried<00:06:46.590> the

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
Drupal manual and it was really easy to

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.260 
Drupal manual and it was really easy to
read<00:06:48.720> it<00:06:48.900> so<00:06:49.500> I'm<00:06:49.889> looking<00:06:50.100> forward<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.639> where
