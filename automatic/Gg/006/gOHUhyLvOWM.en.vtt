00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that it is a safe car so when i first

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
that it is a safe car so when i first
started<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.570> project<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:25.320> definitely

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
started this project i definitely

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.399 
started this project i definitely
thought<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.340> smart<00:01:26.850> car<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.570> european

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
thought that smart car was a european

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.170 
thought that smart car was a european
vehicle<00:01:28.860> meant<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.250> european<00:01:29.729> market<00:01:30.150> i

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
vehicle meant for european market i

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
vehicle meant for european market i
didn't<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> could<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
didn't think that it could make it here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
didn't think that it could make it here
in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> US<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.290> honestly<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> I've<00:01:35.130> been

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
in the US but honestly as I've been

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
in the US but honestly as I've been
getting<00:01:35.430> into<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.060> definitely<00:01:36.330> seen<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
getting into it I'm definitely seen that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.890 
getting into it I'm definitely seen that
there<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.530> market<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.939> yes

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
there is market for it out there yes

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.510 
there is market for it out there yes
it's<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.140> niche<00:01:40.290> market<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.220> might<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.460> be

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's a niche market and it might not be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.210 
it's a niche market and it might not be
as<00:01:41.700> big<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.060> something<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
as big as something like you know a

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.890 
as big as something like you know a
honda<00:01:44.220> accord<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.700> something<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.150> but

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
honda accord or something like that but

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.410 
honda accord or something like that but
but<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.159> definitely<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.640> market<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> can

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
but it's definitely a market that can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
but it's definitely a market that can
make<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> US<00:01:49.400> initially<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.549> only

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
make it in the US initially the only

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
make it in the US initially the only
time<00:01:50.939> I've<00:01:51.030> ever<00:01:51.090> seen<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> smart<00:01:51.659> car<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
time I've ever seen a smart car was in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
time I've ever seen a smart car was in
the<00:01:52.140> ER<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.340> didn't<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.640> much<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the ER so I really didn't have much of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.080 
the ER so I really didn't have much of
an<00:01:54.210> impression<00:01:54.450> sighs<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.229> small<00:01:55.590> size

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
an impression sighs little small size

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
an impression sighs little small size
after<00:01:57.090> getting<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.689> project<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
after getting to know the project I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.070 
after getting to know the project I
understood<00:01:59.610> fuel<00:02:00.150> economy<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.690> all<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
understood fuel economy and all the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.719 
understood fuel economy and all the
other<00:02:01.200> benefits<00:02:01.590> had<00:02:01.680> offered<00:02:02.010> how<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> could

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other benefits had offered how it could

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.020 
other benefits had offered how it could
be<00:02:02.820> eco-friendly<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> car<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
be eco-friendly and how it was a car for

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.980 
be eco-friendly and how it was a car for
almost<00:02:06.360> anyone<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.229> looking<00:02:07.500> for

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.070 

the<00:02:12.590> tritium<00:02:12.920> cell<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:14.030> didn't<00:02:14.540> understand<00:02:14.930> it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the tritium cell I didn't understand it

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720 
the tritium cell I didn't understand it
before<00:02:15.140> necessarily<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.430> someone<00:02:16.700> just

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
before necessarily but someone just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.690 
before necessarily but someone just
explained<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.480> me<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.980> definitely<00:02:19.220> after

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
explained it to me and definitely after

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.090 
explained it to me and definitely after
having<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.360> an<00:02:20.780> understanding<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:21.980> what

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
having a an understanding of it and what

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350 
having a an understanding of it and what
it<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> mean<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.700> thought<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.940> was<00:02:23.000> just<00:02:23.180> like

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
it is I mean I thought it was just like

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.940 
it is I mean I thought it was just like
a<00:02:23.390> roll<00:02:23.780> cage<00:02:23.990> before<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.710> it's<00:02:24.830> certainly

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
a roll cage before but it's certainly

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.190 
a roll cage before but it's certainly
more<00:02:25.280> than<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:25.870> absorbs<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.050> impact

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
more than that that I absorbs the impact

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.490 
more than that that I absorbs the impact
and<00:02:27.530> 2<00:02:27.920> flex<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.370> back<00:02:28.400> into<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.380> into<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and 2 flex it back into the into the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.350 
and 2 flex it back into the into the
crumple<00:02:30.950> zone<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.280> other<00:02:31.460> vehicles<00:02:31.910> it's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
crumple zone to the other vehicles it's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.090 
crumple zone to the other vehicles it's
pretty<00:02:32.540> cool<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.960> like<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.380> my<00:02:33.710> favorite

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
pretty cool I like that my favorite

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.700 
pretty cool I like that my favorite
thing<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.520> smart<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.060> definitely<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
thing about the smart is definitely the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.870 
thing about the smart is definitely the
paddle<00:02:36.710> shifting<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.640> fun<00:02:37.760> to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
paddle shifting it's a lot of fun to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.590 
paddle shifting it's a lot of fun to
drive<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.600> uniqueness<00:02:39.260> system<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:41.180> reason<00:02:41.510> I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
drive the uniqueness system the reason I

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.590 
drive the uniqueness system the reason I
could<00:02:41.900> buy<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.380> smart<00:02:42.800> car<00:02:43.070> as<00:02:43.400> my<00:02:44.060> favorite

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
could buy a smart car as my favorite

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.720 
could buy a smart car as my favorite
features<00:02:44.990> i<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.070> place<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.640> their

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
features i think that the place of their

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.300 
features i think that the place of their
strength<00:02:47.030> where<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.360> can<00:02:47.510> actually<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:49.160> can

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
strength where you can actually you can

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
strength where you can actually you can
add<00:02:49.490> on<00:02:49.730> individual<00:02:50.630> features<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:52.910> by<00:02:53.090> one

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
add on individual features one by one

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.120 
add on individual features one by one
instead<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:54.080> lot<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.440> car<00:02:54.590> companies<00:02:54.920> you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
instead of a lot of car companies you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.490 
instead of a lot of car companies you
buy<00:02:55.310> certain<00:02:56.270> packages<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.990> it's<00:02:57.110> several

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
buy certain packages and it's several

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.230 
buy certain packages and it's several
thousand<00:02:57.920> dollars<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.430> comes<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:59.030> lot

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
thousand dollars and it comes with a lot

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.610 
thousand dollars and it comes with a lot
of<00:02:59.300> stuff<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.750> don't<00:02:59.930> want<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.410> maybe

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
of stuff that you don't want so maybe

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.680

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
you know you want heated seats or you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.820 
you know you want heated seats or you
want<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.990> power<00:03:03.230> moon<00:03:03.500> roof<00:03:03.650> or<00:03:03.800> something

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
want to power moon roof or something

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.950 
want to power moon roof or something
like<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.420> buy<00:03:05.540> several

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.840 
like that but you have to buy several
other<00:03:06.170> features<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.950> don't<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> think

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
other features like don't so I think

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.580 
other features like don't so I think
with<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> smart<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.690> good<00:03:08.960> for<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.500> know

with a smart it's good for you know
starts<00:03:10.220> off<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.610> kind<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.090> stock<00:03:11.360> based

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
starts off and kind of a stock based

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.660 
starts off and kind of a stock based
model<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.530> then<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.800> just<00:03:12.980> add<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
model and then you just add on all the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.950 
model and then you just add on all the
features<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.180> want<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.690> get

everything you want things you don't I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.590 
everything you want things you don't I
think<00:03:17.960> right<00:03:18.110> now<00:03:18.350> as<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.860> student<00:03:19.790> my<00:03:20.150> favorite

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
think right now as a student my favorite

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.330 
think right now as a student my favorite
thing<00:03:20.630> about<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:21.050> smart<00:03:21.380> car<00:03:21.560> would<00:03:21.710> be<00:03:21.890> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
thing about a smart car would be the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.870 
thing about a smart car would be the
price<00:03:22.550> tag<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.620> definitely<00:03:24.620> very<00:03:25.250> affordable

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
price tag so definitely very affordable

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.980 
price tag so definitely very affordable
when<00:03:26.720> you're<00:03:27.850> mindful<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:29.060> your<00:03:29.270> bills<00:03:29.660> in

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
when you're mindful of your bills in

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.470 
when you're mindful of your bills in
