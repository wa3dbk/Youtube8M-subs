schmackdown<00:00:14.820> review<00:00:15.269> videos<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.750> i<00:00:15.780> thought

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
schmackdown review videos so i thought

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.150 
schmackdown review videos so i thought
it'd<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> good<00:00:16.289> time<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> do<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> quick

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it'd be a good time to do a quick

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.460 
it'd be a good time to do a quick
unboxing<00:00:17.340> video<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:19.050> looking<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
unboxing video so just looking at the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710 
unboxing video so just looking at the
outside<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> box<00:00:20.180> very<00:00:21.180> much<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
outside of the box very much like the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.849 
outside of the box very much like the
galaxy<00:00:23.330> s4<00:00:24.330> mini<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.289> unboxed<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
galaxy s4 mini that we just unboxed a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.070 
galaxy s4 mini that we just unboxed a
couple<00:00:26.070> minutes<00:00:26.340> ago<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> note

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
couple minutes ago but this is the note

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.870 
couple minutes ago but this is the note
3<00:00:28.560> quite<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.189> larger<00:00:31.340> take<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> top<00:00:32.669> off

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
3 quite a bit larger take the top off

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
3 quite a bit larger take the top off
and<00:00:33.120> there's<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.660> note<00:00:34.140> 3<00:00:37.370> inside<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> box

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and there's the note 3 inside the box

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
and there's the note 3 inside the box
here<00:00:39.120> i'm<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> guess<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.840> pretty

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
here i'm going to guess is pretty

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.180 
here i'm going to guess is pretty
similar<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.899> s4<00:00:42.899> mini<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.440> had<00:00:43.620> which

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
similar to the s4 mini that we had which

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.410 
similar to the s4 mini that we had which
is<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> instruction<00:00:45.149> manuals<00:00:48.379> quite<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> large

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
is the instruction manuals quite a large

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.410 
is the instruction manuals quite a large
thick<00:00:51.420> sync<00:00:52.379> cable

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.390 

so<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.500> galaxy<00:01:01.340> note<00:01:01.520> 3<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:03.400> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
so this is for the galaxy note 3 is the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.740 
so this is for the galaxy note 3 is the
charge<00:01:05.090> block<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.640> battery<00:01:11.180> now<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.390> battery

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
charge block the battery now the battery

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.860 
charge block the battery now the battery
in<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> note<00:01:12.080> 3<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.870> 3200

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
in the note 3 is going to be a 3200

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.260 
in the note 3 is going to be a 3200
million<00:01:15.260> power<00:01:15.410> battery<00:01:15.470> is<00:01:16.060> very<00:01:17.060> large

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
million power battery is very large

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.360 
million power battery is very large
battery<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.320> very<00:01:18.350> large<00:01:18.710> phone<00:01:19.040> so

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
battery but it's a very large phone so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.880 
battery but it's a very large phone so
it<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.480> definitely<00:01:20.870> needs<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.500> lot<00:01:21.860> of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
it that definitely needs a lot of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.180 
it that definitely needs a lot of
battery<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.340> make<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.580> run<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:27.040> looks<00:01:28.040> like<00:01:28.160> a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
battery to make it run and looks like a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.580 
battery to make it run and looks like a
little<00:01:28.460> puller<00:01:28.670> not<00:01:29.180> sure<00:01:29.450> what<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.840> for

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
little puller not sure what this is for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.560 
little puller not sure what this is for
I'll<00:01:31.430> try<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.760> find<00:01:31.910> out<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.240> leave<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.540> in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
I'll try and find out and leave it in

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.140 
I'll try and find out and leave it in
the<00:01:32.750> description<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> video<00:01:34.000> but<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the description of the video but it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.170 
the description of the video but it
looks<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.450> comes<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:36.530> some<00:01:36.680> pins<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.460> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
looks like comes with some pins and a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.510 
looks like comes with some pins and a
polar<00:01:38.990> maybe<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> does<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.920> take<00:01:40.100> out<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> sim

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
polar maybe it does to take out the sim

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.270 
polar maybe it does to take out the sim
card<00:01:40.900> or<00:01:41.900> something<00:01:42.320> their<00:01:42.560> new<00:01:42.710> as<00:01:42.950> we<00:01:43.130> dig

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
card or something their new as we dig

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.240 
card or something their new as we dig
into<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.550> phone<00:01:43.700> will<00:01:43.880> find<00:01:44.030> out<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:44.420> for

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
into the phone will find out that's for

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.170 
into the phone will find out that's for
all<00:01:46.250> right<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.369> wanted<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.729> zoom<00:01:46.910> in<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.090> little

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
all right I wanted to zoom in a little

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.100 
all right I wanted to zoom in a little
bit<00:01:47.300> closer<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.690> can<00:01:47.780> get<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> little

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
bit closer so you can get a little

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.270 
bit closer so you can get a little
better<00:01:48.320> look<00:01:48.530> let's<00:01:48.800> go<00:01:48.860> ahead<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.040> pull<00:01:49.250> the
