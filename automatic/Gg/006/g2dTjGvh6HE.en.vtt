00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
the one that matches team the most so i

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.139 
the one that matches team the most so i
would<00:00:41.359> imagine<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:42.339> there's<00:00:43.339> going<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.699> be<00:00:43.729> a

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
would imagine that there's going to be a

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.919 
would imagine that there's going to be a
lot<00:00:45.019> of<00:00:45.079> choices<00:00:45.440> hopefully<00:00:46.429> I<00:00:46.969> like<00:00:47.749> that

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
lot of choices hopefully I like that

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.779 
lot of choices hopefully I like that
customization<00:00:48.379> factor<00:00:51.309> another<00:00:52.309> thing<00:00:52.670> I

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
customization factor another thing I

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.579 
customization factor another thing I
noticed<00:00:53.269> is<00:00:53.479> a<00:00:54.069> 78<00:00:55.069> overall<00:00:55.489> rating<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.589> think

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
noticed is a 78 overall rating I think

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.379 
noticed is a 78 overall rating I think
that<00:00:57.799> it's<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.459> little<00:00:58.489> bit<00:00:58.670> too<00:00:58.909> high<00:00:59.089> but

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
that it's a little bit too high but

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:02.619 
that it's a little bit too high but
that's<00:01:00.019> just<00:01:00.170> me<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:01.030> mean<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.059> think<00:01:02.179> should<00:01:02.539> be

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
that's just me I mean I think should be

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.459 
that's just me I mean I think should be
around<00:01:02.780> 72<00:01:03.379> 72<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:04.750> mean<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.409> a

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
around 72 72 but I mean I like that a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.810 
around 72 72 but I mean I like that a
lot<00:01:06.530> better<00:01:06.799> than<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.219> 60<00:01:09.250> also<00:01:10.250> his<00:01:10.520> stats

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
lot better than the 60 also his stats

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.359 
lot better than the 60 also his stats
were<00:01:11.509> pretty<00:01:11.539> good<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.289> I'm<00:01:12.469> a<00:01:12.590> big<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.979> 13

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
were pretty good so I'm a big of a 13

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.649 
were pretty good so I'm a big of a 13
overall<00:01:13.780> in<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:14.930> game<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.619> can<00:01:15.799> get<00:01:16.039> picked

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
overall in this game you can get picked

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.569 
overall in this game you can get picked
first<00:01:17.659> overall<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.159> think<00:01:19.219> that's<00:01:19.399> very

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
first overall and I think that's very

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.310 
first overall and I think that's very
important<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.299> think<00:01:20.390> that's<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.750> cool<00:01:20.899> factor

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
important I think that's a cool factor

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.499 
important I think that's a cool factor
because<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.740> rises<00:01:22.430> your<00:01:22.579> expectations<00:01:23.329> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
because it rises your expectations and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.460 
because it rises your expectations and
whatnot<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.909> pretty<00:01:26.329> much

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
whatnot and you pretty much

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.590 
whatnot and you pretty much
before<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.520> highest<00:01:28.850> pick<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.240> would<00:01:29.390> get

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
before the highest pick you would get

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.870 
before the highest pick you would get
picked<00:01:29.840> as<00:01:30.080> probably<00:01:30.470> i<00:01:30.710> want<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.310> say<00:01:31.430> someone

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
picked as probably i want to say someone

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.660 
picked as probably i want to say someone
someone<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.450> fourth<00:01:32.960> fifth<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.590> mean<00:01:34.370> that's

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
someone get fourth fifth I mean that's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.000 
someone get fourth fifth I mean that's
not<00:01:34.880> high<00:01:35.030> enough<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.420> me<00:01:35.680> but<00:01:36.680> yeah<00:01:36.830> that's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
not high enough to me but yeah that's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.060 
not high enough to me but yeah that's
really<00:01:37.310> important<00:01:38.350> another<00:01:39.350> thing<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.710> saw

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
really important another thing that saw

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.690 
really important another thing that saw

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
Ronnie Ronnie's player with his GM

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.910 
Ronnie Ronnie's player with his GM
talking<00:01:48.460> about<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.670> game<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.990> his<00:01:51.350> game<00:01:51.650> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
talking about the game like his game and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.550 
talking about the game like his game and
who<00:01:52.310> he<00:01:53.030> thinks<00:01:53.300> he<00:01:53.360> should<00:01:53.480> add<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> team

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
who he thinks he should add to the team

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.040 
who he thinks he should add to the team
and<00:01:54.890> probably<00:01:55.760> discussing<00:01:56.150> his<00:01:56.360> contract<00:01:56.870> and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
and probably discussing his contract and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.350 
and probably discussing his contract and
all<00:01:57.200> those<00:01:57.380> things<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.010> think<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:59.030> makes<00:01:59.210> it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
all those things I think that makes it

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.050 
all those things I think that makes it
more<00:02:00.070> lifelike<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.460> think<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:01.820> really

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
more lifelike I think that's really

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.050 
more lifelike I think that's really
important<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.190> that's<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.340> really<00:02:04.760> cool

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
important and that's a really cool

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.520 
important and that's a really cool
factor<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:06.470> added<00:02:06.890> into<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.190> game<00:02:08.530> tell

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
factor that is added into the game tell

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.980 
factor that is added into the game tell
me<00:02:09.619> what<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.920> guys<00:02:10.100> think<00:02:10.300> also<00:02:11.300> another

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
me what you guys think also another

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
uh there's definitely going to be

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.500 
uh there's definitely going to be
