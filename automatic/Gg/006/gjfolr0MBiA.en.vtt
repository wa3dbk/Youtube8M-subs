00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.140
 hello together and welcome to the star 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.379
 was episode 74 today with the tri 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.620
 cross with an identical crossbow the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.360
 we can see pretty pretty 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.260
 You have to look carefully 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.150
 I may just have to express 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
 I'm not really a big fan 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.000
 of metric arms armor and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.489
 but what else in any case is here 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.110
 every amount of work in this mod in it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.270
 the model looks very good as well 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.660
 how textures all very nicely adjusted 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.000
 and yes you can not say much about that 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.490
 is really good but i'm just no 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 huge fan of day weapons and 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.240
 so I would not do it again 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.179
 continue to use and should be on everyone 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 if there are two different ones 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.170
 versions once the normal ones 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.420
 and then here in us 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.130
 we all scream a version of that 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.259
 can kill one hit 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.470
 at random as well 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.970
 would like to mention here by laser 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.500
 me the monty rogers the one particular 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.780
 number i do not know how many but 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.990
 a fair amount of nordic 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 Doors as watchtowers of the truth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.750
 along the coast to the east skyrim 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.640
 the coast adds up along 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.649
 who would not protect his country 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.720
 and by the way is also still 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.700
 pretty cool from another very 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.280
 interesting motto street and learn 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 speech power if you like this place 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.360
 you have read books you can read 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.110
 and you get it 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.890
 points of experience for yours 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.500
 eloquence or whatever 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.880
 to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.380
 and you can do the book a second as well 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.570
 let's read then you get once again 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.130
 a little experience but just not so 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.049
 maybe half or something 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510
 less if the book is a third time 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.959
 lets then you get no experience 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.930
 more 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.090
 this applies to all books in the game 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.590
 Condition is just that one from the book 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.989
 really could learn something it needs 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.510
 for example in history 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.200
 poem or something historical 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.450
 what that belongs to the research and yes he 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.450
 really likes to see a second crossbow 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.659
 dragon fire crespo that's in turn 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.579
 he my style my taste like her 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:01.680
 you can see that simply monkey horny 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:04.239
 haggard my god 18i uses 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.049
 the other thing just looks like power 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.599
 This dragon the arm big transformed 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.819
 was pressed more or less 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.829
 and smash and smash the 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.709
 individual bones what I what looks 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.000
 damn cool from there is not only 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.530
 hit a hit on the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.409
 Heads that can be seen on the sides 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.000
 the mother currently only has ten endorf - and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.590
 May it also can not believe it 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.769
 do not say for it but first gets 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.549
 even a few arrows in the press 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.379
 that is a pity but I know that 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.040
 somehow gets pretty pretty 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.760
 adored I am also his 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 background aware but unfortunately has 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 today he had not so much luck that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.470
 now somehow you should be on everyone 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.000
 here you can have a little cat 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.609
 see the first mike junior and me 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.329
 I'm in the middle of skyrim with cat 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.019
 found 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.879
 the mike junior is called that 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.599
 little easteregg hides the patch 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.220
 output 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.680
 the little kitten has me there as well 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.599
 Get a drink and here we are 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.150
 again at the end except failed 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.680

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.789
 I have a lot on the website today 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.159
 worked was annoying and completely 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.830
 honestly admit that I am everything right now 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.210
 but somehow alone, she gets 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.510
 possible and I do not see it that way 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510
 at times
