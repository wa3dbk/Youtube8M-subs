00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 a make-up inspired that in kardashian 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.620
 find out how to do this in this tutorial 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.530
 we take a rather dark earth and a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.809
 soft brush to create a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.609
 quick and easy contouring to outline 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.680
 the features of our face helping us 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.000
 even with our fingers we go to darken sides 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 of the nose to make it appear thinner 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.090
 take blush and with a brush 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.090
 angled we apply it on the cheekbones 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 we choose a clear concealer and with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 fingers spread out in the area below 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.789
 we apply the eye to illuminate it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 then on the sides of the nose in the middle of the chin 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.710
 on the back of the nose and in the center of the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 front 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.750
 we apply illuminating corrector 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.750
 on the eyebrow arch 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 let's take a pretty brown eye shadow 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 dark and with an angled brush we go 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.390
 to shape our eyebrows in 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.390
 so that they are well in evidence 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.020
 take a cream eye shadow 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 light brown to spread on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 eyelids with a black pencil starting 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 from the fold of the eye we draw one 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.630
 corner curve outside with a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 Angled brush let's go with some 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 color to create a tail outside 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.540
 they also shade the crease of the eye 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.189
 with a bit of color a brush from 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.189
 gradient fade to the outer corner 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.610
 let's take a more gradient brush 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.650
 small and with a brown eye shadow 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 let's go and shade on the fold 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.450
 of the eye blending with the black eye shadow 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.150
 we still blend the colors well with a 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.799
 larger gradient brush with lo 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.240
 same gradient brush more 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.220
 small and black eyeshadow 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.009
 let's discover the eyelash area 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.659
 lower we take a color pencil 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.700
 meat to extend in the cilia rhyme 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.380
 lower 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.390
 let's go and apply false eyelashes 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.489
 we spread the appropriate glue on the attachment 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.680
 fake eyelashes of the supports 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.260
 on our pressing a little so that the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120
 the risk glue knows well on the lips 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.780
 choose a lipstick on the brown or 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.810
 maybe we apply a little metallic 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.700
 over a gloss we ended up 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.480
