00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 and cases we are going to teach them to elaborate 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.389
 these pretty flowers we have not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 made in our channel is the first time 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 that we are going to elaborate very easy very 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.360
 simple, the only thing we're going to do 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.020
 different in this flower is that we're going to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.390
 place a 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 we will place this roll of fabric 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 as we have it here 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.280
 in this flower that we have placed the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.170
 rollito if you want what can 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.870
 do what can be done simple as 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.309
 we have here later in the next 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 We will teach you how to make video 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.870
 all the accessory today we're going to do just 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.140
 what is the little flower first thing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 let's do is cut you 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.200
 squares of cloth of 5 x 5 we are going to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.210
 make 8 petals for the flower 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.580
 one of the squares that you have 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.610
 that is the rollito they will bend 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.600
 this way they are going to warm you up for 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.550
 that since fully bent as what 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.100
 we have here and can work much more 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.280
 easy let's apply a little bit of 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.979
 silicone on the tip 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.409
 to start working and roll up here 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.270
 you simply roll up with your 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 handymen or with the clamp they start 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.009
 roll up to give the shape of what it is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.120
 the roll roll up and now 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.060
 much easier 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.659
 they keep turning the roll 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 until you have already elaborated 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.460
 they go around and you finish 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.369
 another little bit of silicon is already stuck 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.390
 they have the armed rolls left 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.360
 do 8 for what are the little flowers 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.770
 with two other shades of fabric or ribbons 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.330
 they are going to fold in this way both are going to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.330
 place them in this way 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.290
 that they fit well the pintitas go to 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.100
 go down 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.670
 sitting back and puts this 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 This way they will be what is the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 fold here we are going to apply a little 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 of silicone to be able to place the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.890
 roll 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.640
 try that what is part of the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.640
 hit them what 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.850
 pegadito with the cloth 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 here for you to be facilitated 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.950
 fold all the petal can leave like this and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.370
 they already loose 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.410
 The other cloth is taken to one of the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.560
 ends and she will have what 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.790
 is the petal that we are going to work on the day 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.700
 from today 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.090
 a good scissors cut everything they 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.090
 surplus 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.350
 of cloth 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.770
 the lighter 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.670
 good heat that you take all the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.710
 the fabric so there is a good paste not 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.790
 they are going to let go, do not go 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 thwart 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.420
 and so they have already elaborated what they are 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.219
 these pretty petals for you 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.109
 elaborate your accessories if you do not 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.480
 they want with the rolls just makes 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:26.819
 the folds and they will have what 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.600
 is the petal here we have 7 petals 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.330
 in our thread bid 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.530
 this would be noticed do not forget them 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.950
 squares of 5 x 5 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.350
 let's make the next video what it is 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.750
 how to elaborate 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.750
 the bow so you can do it 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.270
 here I have been 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.510
 I already let it go, it got tangled 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.060
 which are the tips of the thread do not 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.980
 much strength for you afterwards 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.980
 can work more easily 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 you do not have to press too hard so you do not 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.669
 they will make it difficult then what the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.590
 mobilization of the petals only what 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.860
 enough that it has not been very 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.160
 I loose some girls just join 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.650
 the petals with silicone then you 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.540
 place a base and the list is ready 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.580
 little flower that's how you like it 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.090
 to work 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.500
 here we count and we're just going to 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.500
 assemble what is the little flower 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.889
 and ready we are going to put it 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.680
 in this way at our table 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.680
 work let's use a circle 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.190
 we put silicone 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.630
 It can be liquid or hot silicone 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.630
 how are you looking 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.840
 that are well stuck 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.720
 and ready 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.580
 we turn we organize those that well 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.020
 paraditos the petals that do not go to 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.930
 stay 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.930
 out there crushed or badly stuck 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.440
 organizes 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.990
 and finally they are going to place what is the 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.780
 center that you have chosen in this 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.680
 opportunity are caritas buttons what 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.680

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.020
 list can make it bigger as the 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.850
 that we have here to place any 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.410
 another small miniature flower what 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.660
