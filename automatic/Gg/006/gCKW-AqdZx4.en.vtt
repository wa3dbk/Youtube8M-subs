00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.910
 and that's how you get into the video as you like 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.140
 knife hardness and lets on 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.349
 how do you first see our knife 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.880
 blank from 60 states was floated 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.120
 sanded and then a little bit more 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 polished and we hacked in the west 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.810
 We use these for hardening 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 birchwood coal 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.480
 We also have a few here 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.010
 fireproof on shoes a pair of pliers and a 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.779
 connoisseur water around emergency something 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 cool 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.279
 ours is based on a grill of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 was lined with dry earth 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 the side we have made a hole around 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 to put a steel pipe into the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 the other end hangs an air pump with 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:46.770
 the air under the coals post 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:48.300
 Now we can take the knife with the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.840
 tongs and stick its genetic 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840
 carbon at all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.560
 and then hope some more coal above 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 about it 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 Now we fill in commercial rapeseed oil 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.200
 a 0 5 liter pet bottle and later 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.200
 to put in the knife 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980
 his 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.460
 In my case, the Stahlhelm had to 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.490
 splashing and the temperature drops 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 to reach 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.220
 then the knife became an hour 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.150
 placed in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.580
 to let it on 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.890
 that is, the knife has hardened after hardening 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 a both hearth that it's like glass 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 Shatter it would not do it 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.850
 it is left on where a bit of the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.890
 Hard to lose after tempering 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.930
 do I have the oxide the remaining oil 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.910
 and ash and all that, not if it is 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.920
 better is removed with one 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.010
 belt sander and then it still on one 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.630
 Sharpened sharpening stone and so we 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.530
 I thank you for watching and up to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 a next video
