I'm making them sizzle in stereo yeah

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.590 
I'm making them sizzle in stereo yeah
it's<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.590> perfect<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.430> use<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> as<00:04:36.060> overhead

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
it's it's perfect I use it as overhead

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.410 
it's it's perfect I use it as overhead
microphones<00:04:37.230> sometimes<00:04:37.620> as<00:04:37.770> well<00:04:38.420> because

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
microphones sometimes as well because

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.790 
microphones sometimes as well because
it's<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.930> same<00:04:40.170> it's<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.530> great

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
it's it's the same it's a great

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's it's the same it's a great
hyper-cardioid<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.850> know<00:04:41.970> condenser<00:04:42.780> mic

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
hyper-cardioid you know condenser mic

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.440 
hyper-cardioid you know condenser mic
with<00:04:44.480> everything<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.660> need<00:04:45.740> from<00:04:46.740> a

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
with everything you need from a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.930 
with everything you need from a
condenser<00:04:48.450> mic<00:04:48.630> it's<00:04:49.500> clean<00:04:50.040> it's<00:04:50.640> really

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
condenser mic it's clean it's really

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.770 
condenser mic it's clean it's really
crisp<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:52.200> can<00:04:52.410> take<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.650> lot<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:53.240> abuse<00:04:54.240> yeah

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
crisp it can take a lot of abuse yeah

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.130 
crisp it can take a lot of abuse yeah
you<00:04:55.140> know<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.910> can<00:04:57.510> take<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.720> lot<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:57.960> air

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
you know and it can take a lot of air

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.990 
you know and it can take a lot of air
pressure<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.560> gain<00:04:58.890> which<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.370> very<00:04:59.910> very

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
pressure and gain which is very very

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.790 
pressure and gain which is very very
important<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.690> doesn't<00:05:01.020> distort<00:05:01.290> easily

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
important it doesn't distort easily

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.880 
important it doesn't distort easily
which<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:03.060> often<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.480> problem<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:04.050> find<00:05:04.560> with

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
which is often a problem I find with

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.780 
which is often a problem I find with
condenser<00:05:05.700> mics<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:08.190> really<00:05:08.400> nice

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
condenser mics so it's it's really nice

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.970 
condenser mics so it's it's really nice
and<00:05:09.150> clean<00:05:09.420> has<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.690> really<00:05:10.020> nice<00:05:10.350> defined

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
and clean has a really nice defined

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.590 
and clean has a really nice defined
crisp<00:05:11.640> top<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.200> know<00:05:13.320> yeah<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:15.390> think

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600
