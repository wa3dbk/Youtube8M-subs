00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
um VirtualBox editions maybe it just got

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.110 
um VirtualBox editions maybe it just got
everything<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.250> needed<00:02:55.460> already<00:03:00.970> put<00:03:01.970> those

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
everything you needed already put those

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:26.730 
everything you needed already put those
two<00:03:02.330> are<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.660> going<00:03:02.870> crazy<00:03:03.910> yes<00:03:04.910> install

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.170 

as<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:27.460> was<00:03:27.580> saying<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.060> nat<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.920> if<00:03:30.010> i<00:03:30.100> do

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
as I was saying this is nat so if i do

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:45.000

my IP config is in the 192 range so it's

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.530 
my IP config is in the 192 range so it's

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.130 
but that's the whole install at this
point<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.730> might<00:04:39.850> want<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.240> shut<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.870> Machine

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
point you might want to shut the Machine

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.590 
point you might want to shut the Machine
down<00:04:41.320> by<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:42.250> proper<00:04:42.670> way<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:43.150> it's<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.420> real

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
down by the proper way like it's a real

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
machine start and shutdown start and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.950 
machine start and shutdown start and
then<00:04:47.380> shut<00:04:47.740> down<00:04:47.920> in<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.160> start<00:04:48.400> menu<00:04:48.580> and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
then shut down in the start menu and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.570 
then shut down in the start menu and
then<00:04:49.960> maybe<00:04:50.470> change<00:04:51.070> your<00:04:51.220> networking

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
then maybe change your networking

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.910 
then maybe change your networking
connections<00:04:52.570> by<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:54.970> want<00:04:55.000> real<00:04:55.920> attached

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
connections by if you want real attached

connections by if you want real attached
to<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.190> real<00:04:57.340> network<00:04:57.700> or<00:04:57.970> if<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.150> want<00:04:58.330> that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
to the real network or if you want that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.870 
to the real network or if you want that
or<00:04:58.870> however<00:04:59.770> you<00:04:59.980> want<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.220> networking<00:05:00.520> I

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
or however you want the networking I

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.350 
or however you want the networking I
prefer<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.810> use<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.080> real<00:05:02.320> card<00:05:02.970> if<00:05:03.970> I'm<00:05:04.120> running

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
prefer to use a real card if I'm running

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.000 
prefer to use a real card if I'm running
several<00:05:04.570> machines<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.110> same<00:05:05.320> time<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.800> need<00:05:05.920> to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
several machines the same time I need to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.730 
several machines the same time I need to
adjust<00:05:06.070> my<00:05:06.370> video<00:05:06.610> resolution<00:05:07.440> I'm<00:05:08.440> running

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
adjust my video resolution I'm running

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.410 
adjust my video resolution I'm running
several<00:05:08.950> machines<00:05:09.340> at<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.610> same<00:05:09.820> time<00:05:11.880> then<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
several machines at the same time then I

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.990 
several machines at the same time then I
may<00:05:13.840> want<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.110> use<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.230> private<00:05:14.680> network<00:05:15.000> both

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
may want to use a private network both

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.100 
may want to use a private network both
the<00:05:16.120> most<00:05:16.300> part<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.570> just<00:05:16.720> use<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> public

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
the most part I just use a public

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:25.440 
the most part I just use a public
network<00:05:17.820> don't<00:05:18.820> have<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:18.940> cd-rom<00:05:19.510> in<00:05:24.450> doesn't

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
network don't have a cd-rom in doesn't

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:33.550 
network don't have a cd-rom in doesn't
look<00:05:25.540> like<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.840> does

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:45.670 

still<00:05:34.460> has<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.880> guest<00:05:35.419> additions<00:05:35.690> in<00:05:36.050> there

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.170 

I<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:46.520> pulled<00:05:46.759> a<00:05:46.820> cd-rom<00:05:47.240> right<00:05:47.479> out<00:05:47.630> of<00:05:47.660> it

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I just pulled a cd-rom right out of it

00:05:49.180 --> 00:06:04.960 
I just pulled a cd-rom right out of it
well<00:05:50.180> that's<00:05:50.419> fine

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.250 

so<00:06:05.970> now<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.120> can<00:06:06.300> move<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.540> mouse<00:06:06.720> in<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.140> out

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
so now I can move the mouse in and out

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:16.130 
so now I can move the mouse in and out
freely<00:06:12.770> so<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:14.640> deal<00:06:14.850> now<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.420> should<00:06:15.450> shut

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
freely so the deal now is I should shut

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:26.930 
freely so the deal now is I should shut
it<00:06:16.230> down<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.830> proper<00:06:17.190> way

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.750 

and<00:06:27.440> son<00:06:28.440> box<00:06:28.740> will<00:06:29.010> save<00:06:29.280> whatever<00:06:29.730> changes

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
and son box will save whatever changes

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.890 
and son box will save whatever changes
son<00:06:32.760> virtualbox<00:06:33.330> will<00:06:33.510> save<00:06:33.690> whatever

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
son virtualbox will save whatever

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.600 
son virtualbox will save whatever
changes<00:06:34.380> and<00:06:34.560> I<00:06:34.590> can<00:06:34.740> make<00:06:34.830> that<00:06:34.890> a<00:06:35.130> network

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
changes and I can make that a network

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.030 
changes and I can make that a network
change<00:06:35.910> usually<00:06:36.600> I<00:06:36.660> do<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.960> right<00:06:37.260> away<00:06:37.320> but

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
change usually I do that right away but

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.520 
change usually I do that right away but
um<00:06:38.250> I<00:06:38.490> want<00:06:38.670> to<00:06:38.760> use<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.060> bridged<00:06:39.810> adapter<00:06:39.960> and

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
um I want to use the bridged adapter and

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.650 
um I want to use the bridged adapter and
yes<00:06:41.160> I<00:06:41.340> get<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.580> choice<00:06:41.730> of<00:06:42.000> my<00:06:42.150> network<00:06:42.450> card

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
yes I get the choice of my network card

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.050 
yes I get the choice of my network card
and<00:06:42.990> for<00:06:43.290> network<00:06:43.560> cards<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.550> hopefully<00:06:44.730> this

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
and for network cards so hopefully this

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.010 
and for network cards so hopefully this
taught<00:06:45.510> you<00:06:45.660> something<00:06:45.870> about<00:06:46.910> son

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
taught you something about son

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.050 
taught you something about son
virtualbox<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:49.700> you'll<00:06:50.700> get<00:06:50.790> to<00:06:50.880> play<00:06:50.940> with

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
virtualbox and you'll get to play with

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.160 
virtualbox and you'll get to play with
it<00:06:51.270> more<00:06:51.300> for<00:06:51.660> it<00:06:51.840> thank<00:06:52.830> you<00:06:52.890> for<00:06:53.010> watching
