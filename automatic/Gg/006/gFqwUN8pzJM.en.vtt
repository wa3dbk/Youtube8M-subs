00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
enough points to learn it because they

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.170 
enough points to learn it because they
all<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.930> cost<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.159> engrams<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.790> basically

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
all have a cost so engrams are basically

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.270

if you use the stone pick on a tree you
will<00:03:57.300> get<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:57.720> thatch<00:03:58.050> than<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.500> will<00:03:58.680> wood

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
will get more thatch than you will wood

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.040 
will get more thatch than you will wood
and<00:03:59.160> if<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.670> use<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.030> hatchet<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.780> will<00:04:00.900> get

more woods than you do fetch this can be

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.970 
more woods than you do fetch this can be
very<00:04:03.570> useful<00:04:03.990> when<00:04:04.020> gathering<00:04:04.380> particular

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
very useful when gathering particular

resources after some resource gathering

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.370 
resources after some resource gathering
it<00:04:08.940> won't<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.270> long<00:04:09.480> before<00:04:09.660> you'll<00:04:10.020> be<00:04:10.050> able

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
to level up again this time I recommend

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.270 
to level up again this time I recommend
getting<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.110> spear<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.920> defend

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
fatch foundation which will be used for

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.990 
fatch foundation which will be used for
building<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:19.080> shelter<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.890> if<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.580> see<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:20.970> of
