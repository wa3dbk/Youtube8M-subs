00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
you can only have one at a time and I

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.540 
you can only have one at a time and I
think<00:02:22.810> I'm<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.680> hundred<00:02:23.830> percent<00:02:23.980> sure<00:02:24.160> but

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
think I'm not a hundred percent sure but

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.800 
think I'm not a hundred percent sure but
once<00:02:24.819> you've<00:02:25.030> loaned<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.360> player<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.690> don't

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
once you've loaned a player I don't

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.750 
once you've loaned a player I don't
think<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.319> pops<00:02:26.500> back<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.920> your<00:02:27.010> loans<00:02:27.220> players

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
think it pops back in your loans players

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.559 
think it pops back in your loans players
ever<00:02:28.060> again

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
ever again

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.180 
ever again
I'm<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> hundred<00:02:29.410> percent<00:02:29.530> sure<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:30.069> might

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
I'm not a hundred percent sure it might

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.100 
I'm not a hundred percent sure it might
be<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.459> like<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> cycle<00:02:31.180> where<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.599> completely

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
be on like a cycle where it's completely

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.690 
be on like a cycle where it's completely
random<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:32.680> once<00:02:32.860> you've<00:02:33.069> exhausted

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
random and then once you've exhausted

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.520 
random and then once you've exhausted
all<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.269> players<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.750> goes<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.200> puts<00:02:35.379> them

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
all the players it goes and puts them

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.559 
all the players it goes and puts them
back<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.830> again<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.190> not<00:02:36.580> 100%<00:02:37.030> sure<00:02:37.209> yet

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
back in again I'm not 100% sure yet

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.350 
back in again I'm not 100% sure yet
because<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.349> said<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.430> 24th<00:02:40.150> September

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
because as I said is the 24th September

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.940 
because as I said is the 24th September
right<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.140> we<00:02:41.230> haven't<00:02:41.379> played<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.769> long

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
right now so we haven't played it long

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
right now so we haven't played it long
enough<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.280> see<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.510> players<00:02:43.720> come<00:02:43.959> back

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
enough to see if the players come back

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.660 
enough to see if the players come back
round<00:02:44.290> again<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:44.860> for<00:02:45.069> example<00:02:45.160> win<00:02:45.519> on<00:02:45.640> my

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
round again but for example win on my

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.069 
round again but for example win on my
offer<00:02:45.910> account<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.390> here<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.720> see<00:02:46.870> loads

to loan instead of Noah and yeah it's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.650 
to loan instead of Noah and yeah it's
completely<00:02:51.849> different<00:02:52.030> all<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.329> time<00:02:52.510> it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
completely different all the time it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.120 
completely different all the time it
changes<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.110> time<00:02:53.200> when<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.950> learn<00:02:54.099> a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
changes all the time when you learn a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.620 
changes all the time when you learn a
player<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:54.849> you<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.120> back<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.510> loan

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
player and then you go back to the loan

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330 
player and then you go back to the loan
system<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.530> refreshes<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
system I think it refreshes all the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.190 
system I think it refreshes all the
players<00:02:57.579> it<00:02:58.299> ever<00:02:58.510> refreshes<00:02:59.019> all<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
players it ever refreshes all the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.390 
players it ever refreshes all the
players<00:02:59.410> or<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.769> gives<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.040> another<00:03:00.220> option

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
players or it gives you another option

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.670 
players or it gives you another option
instead<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> option<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.720> chose<00:03:02.049> so

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
instead of the option that you chose so

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.199 
instead of the option that you chose so
