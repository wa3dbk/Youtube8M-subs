00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
This is my tip for baking a chicken that's crunchy on the outside and juicy inside.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.000
It never fails.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Stay connected

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you could win a fun game to play at dessert time.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
I've cooked hundreds of chickens in my life,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
and my favorites are medium-size chickens,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
of no more of 4.5 to 5 pounds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They're tender, they cook fast and evenly,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the meat comes out juicy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The key to having a chicken that's crunchy on the outside

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is making sure the skin is perfectly dry when it goes in the oven.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
How do I do it?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Easy. First, pat it dry with a paper towel both inside and out.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then, season it well,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
rubbing it with salt and your favorite spices.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My secret is a teaspoon of baking powder for every tablespoon of salt

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and half a teaspoon of pepper

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
or any other spices that you prefer.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Season it on the outside and inside.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
Place it in a pan

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
and leave it in the refrigerator, uncovered, overnight

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
or ideally for 24 hours.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
Pat it dry again

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.000
Bend the wings inward

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
so they don't burn.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Heat the oven at 475° F or 500° F.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Cook it for 15 minutes per pound.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you can place the chicken on a roasting rack, it's even better

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because the air will circulate and the chicken won't stick.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.600
I want to warn you, there will be smoke in your kitchen, so be sure to open your window.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600
Once cooked,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.000
let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Delicious!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm sure it will become part of your weekly menu.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.000
