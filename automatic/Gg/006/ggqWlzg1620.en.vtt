law<00:00:48.640> what<00:00:49.640> sure<00:00:50.230> let's<00:00:51.230> learn<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.590> basics

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.479 

first<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.780> all<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:57.020> have<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.200> staff<00:00:57.590> five<00:00:58.190> lines

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
first of all we have a staff five lines

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.939 
first of all we have a staff five lines
and<00:00:58.879> no<00:00:59.120> these<00:00:59.660> are<00:00:59.809> not<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.350> guitar<00:01:00.620> strings

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
and no these are not the guitar strings

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.189 
and no these are not the guitar strings
and<00:01:01.610> we<00:01:01.699> have<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.850> clef<00:01:02.150> used<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.809> be<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.050> letter

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
and we have a clef used to be the letter

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.850 
and we have a clef used to be the letter
G<00:01:03.580> now<00:01:04.580> in<00:01:04.879> music<00:01:05.300> we<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:05.960> an<00:01:06.080> alphabet<00:01:06.560> A

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
G now in music we have an alphabet A

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.370 
G now in music we have an alphabet A
through<00:01:07.550> G<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.510> give<00:01:08.750> names<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
through G and we give names to all the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.040 
through G and we give names to all the
notes<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.700> what<00:01:10.940> do<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:11.300> this<00:01:11.510> treble

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
notes so what do you think this treble

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.410 
notes so what do you think this treble
clef<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.500> telling<00:01:12.860> us<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.790> shows<00:01:14.090> where<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
clef is telling us it shows where the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.630 
clef is telling us it shows where the
letter<00:01:14.600> G<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.870> located<00:01:15.500> see<00:01:16.130> how<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.340> makes<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
letter G is located see how it makes a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.890 
letter G is located see how it makes a
target<00:01:17.620> that's<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.979> letter<00:01:19.159> G<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:20.750> do<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
target that's the letter G what do you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.950 
target that's the letter G what do you
think<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.170> note<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.500> space<00:01:21.830> below<00:01:22.130> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
think the note in the space below is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.320 
think the note in the space below is
it's<00:01:23.960> F<00:01:24.370> how<00:01:25.370> about<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.700> note<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.060> space

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's F how about the note in the space

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.490 
it's F how about the note in the space
above<00:01:27.010> trick<00:01:28.010> question<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:28.760> not<00:01:29.030> H<00:01:29.330> it's<00:01:29.840> a

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
above trick question it's not H it's a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.030 
above trick question it's not H it's a
why<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.570> musical<00:01:33.080> alphabet<00:01:33.230> repeats

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
why because the musical alphabet repeats

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.990 
why because the musical alphabet repeats
after<00:01:34.430> G<00:01:34.700> starts<00:01:35.570> again<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.550> why<00:01:37.550> do<00:01:37.610> we<00:01:37.790> give

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
after G starts again on a why do we give

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.540 
after G starts again on a why do we give
notes<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.510> same<00:01:38.720> name<00:01:39.020> well<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:40.430> they

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
notes the same name well because they

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.720 
notes the same name well because they
sound<00:01:40.730> similar<00:01:40.970> like<00:01:41.420> kind<00:01:41.870> of<00:01:41.900> like<00:01:41.990> brothers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
sound similar like kind of like brothers

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.250 
sound similar like kind of like brothers

they're the same pitch even though the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.120 
they're the same pitch even though the
woman's<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.620> higher<00:01:57.830> makes<00:01:58.430> sense<00:01:59.500> anyway<00:02:00.500> to

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
woman's is higher makes sense anyway to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.920 
woman's is higher makes sense anyway to
remember<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.640> notes<00:02:01.760> just<00:02:02.210> remember<00:02:02.720> the

remember the notes just remember the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.550 
remember the notes just remember the
letter<00:02:03.170> G<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.800> then<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.490> alphabetical

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
letter G and then it's alphabetical

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.440 
letter G and then it's alphabetical
here's<00:02:06.560> another<00:02:06.890> way<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.130> remember<00:02:07.610> them<00:02:07.760> the

the<00:02:16.730> word<00:02:17.030> face<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.220> step<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.760> pretty

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the word face now the step is pretty

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.809 
the word face now the step is pretty
small<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:20.660> sometimes<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.920> need<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.099> extend<00:02:22.640> it

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
small so sometimes we need to extend it

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.839 
small so sometimes we need to extend it
