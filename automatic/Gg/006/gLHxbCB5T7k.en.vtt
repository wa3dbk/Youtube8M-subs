00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
android device but they don't have the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
android device but they don't have the
actual<00:00:39.030> navigation<00:00:39.750> bar<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
actual navigation bar in there which is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
actual navigation bar in there which is
like<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> bottom<00:00:41.690> with

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like a little thing at the bottom with

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
like a little thing at the bottom with
like<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.410> home<00:00:43.829> button<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> two

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
like the little home button and the two

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
like the little home button and the two
other<00:00:45.180> buttons<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.920> Android

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
