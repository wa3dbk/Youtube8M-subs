00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.779 
question that I've been getting a lot
over<00:00:14.120> email<00:00:14.750> lately<00:00:15.020> and<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:16.190> question<00:00:16.369> is

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
over email lately and the question is

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.240 
over email lately and the question is
regarding<00:00:17.240> officials<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:18.470> prostate<00:00:18.800> cancer

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
regarding officials and prostate cancer

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.610 
regarding officials and prostate cancer
is<00:00:19.430> there<00:00:19.820> really<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.539> correlation<00:00:21.320> with

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 
is there really a correlation with

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.470 
is there really a correlation with
visuals<00:00:22.100> keep<00:00:22.340> you<00:00:22.460> posted<00:00:22.850> cancer<00:00:23.270> is<00:00:23.360> the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
visuals keep you posted cancer is the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.110 
visuals keep you posted cancer is the
question<00:00:23.870> okay<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:25.280> basically<00:00:25.640> I'm

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
question okay and this basically I'm

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.250 
question okay and this basically I'm
getting<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.390> whole<00:00:26.600> bunch<00:00:26.780> of<00:00:26.930> emails

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
getting a whole bunch of emails

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.230 
getting a whole bunch of emails
regarding<00:00:27.620> this<00:00:28.040> because<00:00:28.460> some<00:00:28.700> stuff<00:00:29.030> came

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
regarding this because some stuff came

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.120 
regarding this because some stuff came
out<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.600> then<00:00:29.720> use<00:00:29.930> basically<00:00:30.530> saying<00:00:30.860> that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
out and then use basically saying that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.369 
out and then use basically saying that
there's<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.430> study<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.820> says<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:33.079> if<00:00:33.260> you

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
there's a study that says that if you

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.510 
there's a study that says that if you
take<00:00:33.559> fish<00:00:33.800> oil<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.129> you're<00:00:34.219> going<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.399> go

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
take fish oil so you're going to go

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.000 
take fish oil so you're going to go
ahead<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.730> get<00:00:34.910> prostate<00:00:35.360> cancer<00:00:35.840> okay<00:00:36.410> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
ahead and get prostate cancer okay the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.000 
ahead and get prostate cancer okay the
key<00:00:37.370> thing<00:00:37.400> to<00:00:37.730> understand<00:00:38.660> here<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.710> you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
key thing to understand here is that you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.380 
key thing to understand here is that you
need<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.280> understand<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.820> nature<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
need to understand the nature of the

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.479 
need to understand the nature of the
study<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.200> I'm<00:00:42.320> not<00:00:42.560> saying<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.160> study

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
study and I'm not saying that the study

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.120 
study and I'm not saying that the study
is<00:00:43.840> invalid<00:00:44.840> but<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.260> need<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.530> understand

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
is invalid but you need to understand

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.880 
is invalid but you need to understand
what<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.970> study<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.390> all<00:00:47.570> about<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:48.710> is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
what the study is all about and this is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.310 
what the study is all about and this is
what<00:00:49.040> is<00:00:49.160> called<00:00:49.460> an<00:00:49.930> epidemiological<00:00:50.930> study

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
what is called an epidemiological study

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.250 
what is called an epidemiological study
basically<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.870> correlational<00:00:53.870> study

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
basically this is a correlational study

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.110 
basically this is a correlational study
and<00:00:54.470> what<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:54.800> means<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.310> that<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.059> a

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
and what this means is that this is a

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.850 
and what this means is that this is a
study<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.600> looks<00:00:56.809> at<00:00:56.960> statistical<00:00:57.649> evidence

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
study that looks at statistical evidence

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.549 
study that looks at statistical evidence
it<00:00:58.700> looks<00:00:58.970> at<00:00:59.149> things<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.720> people<00:01:00.020> eat<00:01:00.200> them

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
it looks at things that people eat them

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.620 
it looks at things that people eat them
then<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.829> tries<00:01:01.040> to<00:01:01.070> go<00:01:01.340> ahead<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.790> correlate

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
then it tries to go ahead and correlate

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.760 
then it tries to go ahead and correlate
what<00:01:03.380> can<00:01:03.590> be<00:01:03.800> fixed<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.430> kind<00:01:04.699> of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
what can be fixed that kind of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.160 
what can be fixed that kind of
consumption<00:01:06.770> has<00:01:07.130> okay<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.329> basically<00:01:08.509> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
consumption has okay so basically this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.469 
consumption has okay so basically this
is<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.380> story<00:01:09.860> than<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:10.190> gathers<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.030> whole

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
is a story than just gathers a whole

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.110 
is a story than just gathers a whole
bunch<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:11.990> data<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:13.280> tries<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.640> make

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
bunch of data and then tries to make

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.350 
bunch of data and then tries to make
correlations<00:01:15.049> try<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.409> associate<00:01:16.040> things<00:01:16.700> to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
correlations try to associate things to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.660 
correlations try to associate things to
that<00:01:17.510> data<00:01:17.870> okay<00:01:18.590> there's<00:01:19.159> nothing<00:01:19.310> kind<00:01:19.580> of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
that data okay there's nothing kind of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.280 
that data okay there's nothing kind of
study<00:01:19.909> enough<00:01:20.299> for<00:01:20.479> example<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:20.990> go<00:01:21.170> ahead

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
study enough for example you go ahead

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.500 
study enough for example you go ahead
and<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.650> put<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.760> put<00:01:23.000> like<00:01:23.119> some<00:01:23.299> cell

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
and you put and you put like some cell

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.390 
and you put and you put like some cell
cultures<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.530> pump<00:01:24.830> them<00:01:25.040> up<00:01:25.159> with

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
cultures and you pump them up with

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.340 
cultures and you pump them up with
visuals<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.119> see<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.420> happens<00:01:26.780> that's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
visuals and you see what happens that's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.080 
visuals and you see what happens that's
not<00:01:27.500> exactly<00:01:27.650> what<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.310> all<00:01:28.580> about<00:01:28.640> this

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
not exactly what this is all about this

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530 
not exactly what this is all about this
is<00:01:29.210> more<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.750> statistical<00:01:30.590> analysis<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.700> things

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
is more a statistical analysis of things

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.850 
is more a statistical analysis of things
that<00:01:33.290> go<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.530> okay<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.049> basically<00:01:36.049> that's

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
that go on okay and basically that's

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.670 
that go on okay and basically that's
what<00:01:36.979> needs<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.700> be<00:01:37.790> understood<00:01:38.140> because<00:01:39.140> I

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
what needs to be understood because I

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.830 
what needs to be understood because I
think<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.700> lot<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.909> people<00:01:41.000> are<00:01:41.360> getting<00:01:41.540> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
think a lot of people are getting the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
think a lot of people are getting the
idea<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.710> study<00:01:43.040> was<00:01:43.159> more<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.720> terms<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.439> a

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
idea the study was more in terms of a

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.890 
idea the study was more in terms of a
biological<00:01:46.220> sort<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:46.970> study<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.450> that's<00:01:47.659> not

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
biological sort of study and that's not

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.580 
biological sort of study and that's not
really<00:01:48.290> what<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:49.130> case<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.369> here<00:01:49.909> okay<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.560> I

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
really what the case is here okay so I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.320 
really what the case is here okay so I
think<00:01:51.680> that's<00:01:51.950> important<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.670> know<00:01:52.700> them<00:01:53.090> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
think that's important to know them to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.420 
think that's important to know them to
understand<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.960> difference<00:01:54.439> okay<00:01:55.009> once

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
understand the difference okay once

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.490 
understand the difference okay once
again<00:01:55.580> I'm<00:01:55.820> not<00:01:55.850> saying<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.990> study<00:01:57.229> has

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
again I'm not saying that this study has

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800 
again I'm not saying that this study has
no<00:01:57.860> relevance<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.270> doesn't<00:01:59.509> know<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.720> I'm

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
fact that it's not what a lot of people

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.309 
fact that it's not what a lot of people
think<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:06.079> ok<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:07.040> with<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.030> say<00:02:08.329> I<00:02:08.689> will<00:02:09.170> say

the following there's I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.100 
the following there's I
huge<00:02:11.600> amount<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.770> evidence<00:02:13.840> indicating<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
huge amount of evidence indicating the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.550 
huge amount of evidence indicating the
safety<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.280> efficacy<00:02:17.020> officials<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
safety and efficacy officials the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.140 
safety and efficacy officials the
incredible<00:02:19.010> effect<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.640> has<00:02:19.670> some

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
incredible effect that it has some

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.480 
incredible effect that it has some
various<00:02:20.660> things<00:02:21.020> such<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.460> know

various things such as like you know

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.360 
various things such as like you know
hormonal<00:02:23.180> production<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:24.370> insulin

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
effects on the health as well and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.770 
effects on the health as well and
because<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.670> huge<00:02:38.180> amount<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.660> evidence

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
because of this huge amount of evidence

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.710 
because of this huge amount of evidence
I<00:02:39.230> think<00:02:39.710> we<00:02:40.580> need<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.880> consider<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.450> fact

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
I think we need to consider the fact

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.190 
I think we need to consider the fact
that<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.170> know<00:02:42.280> facials<00:02:43.280> are<00:02:43.910> not<00:02:44.570> harmful<00:02:44.990> to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
that you know facials are not harmful to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.070 
that you know facials are not harmful to
your<00:02:45.530> health<00:02:45.590> at<00:02:45.950> all<00:02:46.070> okay<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.900> key

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
your health at all okay and the key

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.960 
your health at all okay and the key
thing<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.320> understand<00:02:48.860> too<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.490> every

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
thing to understand too is that every

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.790 
thing to understand too is that every
single<00:02:50.150> food<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.810> consume<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.590> food

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
single food that you consume and food

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.280 
single food that you consume and food
supplement<00:02:52.280> as<00:02:52.400> well<00:02:52.640> may<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> study<00:02:54.170> out

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
supplement as well may have a study out

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.140 
supplement as well may have a study out
there<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:54.830> they<00:02:54.890> will<00:02:55.040> correlate<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.850> some

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
there and they will correlate it to some

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.090 
there and they will correlate it to some
sort<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.450> disease<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.410> cancer<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.980> example

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
sort of disease like cancer for example

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.570 
sort of disease like cancer for example
and<00:02:59.170> therefore<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> key<00:03:00.500> thing<00:03:00.770> is<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.010> go<00:03:01.550> I

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
and therefore the key thing is to go I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.310 
and therefore the key thing is to go I
don't<00:03:01.910> think<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> look<00:03:02.330> at<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.750> say<00:03:02.960> okay

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
don't think a look at it and say okay

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.830 
don't think a look at it and say okay
you<00:03:03.380> know<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.520> have<00:03:04.570> enough<00:03:05.570> evidence

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
you know do you have enough evidence

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.160 
you know do you have enough evidence
dating<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.220> fact<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.210> is<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:08.600> safe<00:03:08.870> thing

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
dating the fact that it is a safe thing

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.510 
dating the fact that it is a safe thing
to<00:03:09.230> take<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.130> enough<00:03:10.370> evidence

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
to take do you have enough evidence

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.420 
to take do you have enough evidence
stating<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.960> benefits<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.860> has<00:03:13.070> and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
stating the benefits that it has and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.180 
stating the benefits that it has and
then<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.760> kind<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:14.240> make<00:03:14.510> an<00:03:15.440> analysis

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
then you kind of like make an analysis

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.790 
then you kind of like make an analysis
of<00:03:16.220> whether<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.090> good<00:03:17.330> for<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.690> not<00:03:17.840> now

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
of whether it is good for you or not now

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.070 
of whether it is good for you or not now
there<00:03:19.520> are<00:03:19.550> your<00:03:19.850> studies<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.360> indicate<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
there are your studies that indicate you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.320 
there are your studies that indicate you
know<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.380> if<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.530> breathe<00:03:22.160> too<00:03:22.640> much<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
know that if you breathe too much of the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.270 
know that if you breathe too much of the
wrong<00:03:23.360> air<00:03:23.780> you're<00:03:24.440> gonna<00:03:24.560> be<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.770> cancer<00:03:25.130> too

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
wrong air you're gonna be in cancer too

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120 
wrong air you're gonna be in cancer too
well<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.910> know<00:03:26.060> you're<00:03:26.209> not<00:03:26.300> breathing<00:03:26.840> right

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
well you know you're not breathing right

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.340 
well you know you're not breathing right
so<00:03:28.130> therefore<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.540> me<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.020> same<00:03:30.320> thing

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
so therefore it to me is the same thing

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.650 
so therefore it to me is the same thing
with<00:03:30.680> visuals<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.250> mean<00:03:31.430> officials<00:03:31.970> contain

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
with visuals I mean officials contain

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.250 
with visuals I mean officials contain
essential<00:03:33.350> fatty<00:03:34.250> acids<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.030> because<00:03:35.900> this

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
essential fatty acids and because this

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.530 
essential fatty acids and because this
ficials<00:03:36.739> contain<00:03:37.190> these<00:03:37.430> fats<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:38.120> are

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
ficials contain these fats that are

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.810 
ficials contain these fats that are
essential<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.320> your<00:03:39.680> health<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.520> life
