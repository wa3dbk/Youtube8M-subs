00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 hi bye here for a video finally 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.059
 indeed more than one even if I can 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.250
 I have rarely seen it ceases to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 so it doesn't matter 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.759
 today I give you a road test of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 pin is the background 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 I have been saying for days I make a video 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 I drive I make a video e 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 finally today I am ready I wanted 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 shoot some video tags 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.689
 but I absolutely don't want to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 put on makeup but just 000 and then I have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.360
 thought to just put some mascara 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.420
 and a beautifully lit lipstick, however, they catch 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 the ball to make them a try on 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 road in the road test of this is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.300
 the mis manga the mega volume pain to the yes 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 I also happened to mention 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.550
 armella this is the power of packaging 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 because it's great, I really like it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 they really got the packaging right 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 according to me the colors of palermo e 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.869
 so it's a purple and pink hello and fuchsia 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 i like i like advertising is 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 beautiful but a joke 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 advertising is really very beautiful 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 well done they were very good 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 creative the only fight is that in my opinion 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 this mega volume mascara is not a mega 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.710
 volume in the sense that it makes beautiful 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.840
 eyelashes now you will see them to my taste but 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 I do n't see this volume 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.990
 I do not see it absolutely does not make me either 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.900
 also the effect too glued to put it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 all a completely different canine effect 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.299
 pleasant but quite different effect 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.380
 basically this and paid him 9 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.159
 euros and 90 on offer water and soap 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.579
 for per to for 8.5 mm with a pole 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.579
 six months 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.640
 deserves in note humerus for a more price 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.829
 great great majority and over and I do not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 I would have taken frankly so I have 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.050
 took advantage of one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.700
 sure and I bought it is to say that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.800
 I saw the image I saw the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.990
 mascara is applied by now their myth 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 in and I had really liked dr 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 get the release of his video for 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.260
 buy it but I didn't make it are 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.320
 go for a water and soap hansen tigotÃ  

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.810
 you find the niche he bought it 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.190
 brush and this is the pipe cleaner and this 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 it's a bug brush you see them in 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.590
 conical bristles and misses will bring all ve 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.020
 I show him the prerogative of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.820
 be very flexible flexible 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 you see the great good in the sense that 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.080
 allows you to capture with extreme 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.570
 easiness 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
 the small one after his product le 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.739
 eyelashes with the product so this is 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.900
 certainly a positive note note lab 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.810
 negative is that if you don't have one 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 manual dexterity is always convenient to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.320
 use 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.010
 I would now zoom in on my eyes 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.250
 plus I have torn skin 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.500
 full of pimples and let's do this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.600
 eye goes that the one more in light and then 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.549
 we make a comparison or don't have 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.590
 made an eye I was part of it first 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.390
 with an application I'm doing one 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.850
 massacre guys really is me 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.080
 dirtying and doing a first 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.150
 light application and then we go 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.769
 intensify this was more in the shade 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.200
 so it looks darker than 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.060
 this but they are absolutely non-make-up 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.720
 both 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.769
 let's start with a pass 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.769
 quite light 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.320
 here we are also below 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.920
 this is the effect with a micro 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.500
 lowered as you see and it is evident 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.840
 what is not so much about volume effect 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.170
 how much an effect of length e 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.480
 definition go ahead apply yet 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.060
 the product by stratifying by itself I exaggerate 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:19.850
 you know that I like scale 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.850
 exaggerated I insist well here on the eyelashes 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 see I do n't know if you notice how it comes 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.360
 stretched yes perhaps a little to 17 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.050
 very nice as it did if it follows 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.389
 90 of the look does not long then rest lashes 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.000
 so here's how you see it would be fine already 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.180
 I want to abound again but not 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.060
 I dip the work brush again 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.260
 always what I've already applied 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.320
 I think this can be a bit 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.850
 compromise to have a super effect 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:09.210
 without wasting product avalanches 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:13.080
 here we are fouled as always 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.430
 I also apply under I can't 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.430
 put of from mascara underneath 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.170
 here we are and this is simply the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.940
 boulder simply this is 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.650
 objectively the super effect it does 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.850
 I repeat for 9 euros and 90 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.000
 I would say it seemed to be affection 22 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.670
 different eyes the effect is decidedly 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.250
 pleasant asks in a thing I have 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.080
 problems removing make-up from this product or 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.160
 big problems to break it too 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.430
 with the take the day of balm by clinique 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.160
 and it has never left me enough 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.620
 the difference is terrible 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.790
 left quite perplexed in the sense 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.760
 that the take the day of palma takes away 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.840
 also the mortar also the cement taken 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.380
 rapid 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.630
 instead with this mascara it does so much 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.020
 so much effort 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.570
 here is the global vote however it is 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.730
 definitely a 7 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.920
 I would like to promote it though 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.440
 remember if you are looking for a volume event 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.380
 but I am not convinced that if the product 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.050
 right for you for the length effect 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.740
 for the definition effect is definitely 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.140
 objectively a great product 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.630
 having said that I leave you I leave you with 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.940
 next video thanks to all those 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.960
 really thirsty support and hello 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.960
 the next video
