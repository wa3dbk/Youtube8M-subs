00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 yo guys strengthen my sons but fast 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.410
 welcome back to a new video and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 as you can see it is another upgrade 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 downgrade video the first playing 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.469
 today davy klaassen is the last 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.090
 I had him and a wide dark video 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.769
 tancredi you were just a lot of you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.549
 you disagree i love is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.509
 I wouldn't either 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.580
 i just think he needs an upgrade too 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 and this is fun drove the for the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 player is none other than mitchell 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 a great season last year 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.180
 shot at Willem III 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.920
 Willem 2 and now that is back at Ajax 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.880
 I think it's great in their 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 need to get 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 he is a whopping 4 points they are 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 left back still naturalness 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140
 are born faster tribble 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.899
 capacities and for our pass I think 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 greatly improved after the previous games 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
 cillessen jasper cillessen a great 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 type he is two dots up and that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 is well deserved I think after his good 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.410
 performance 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 China 10 million item speculations 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.079
 There I call it no longer expected to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 fan so buy it 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 cillessen for ajax continues to play well 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 excellent type ran in every statistic 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.180
 something does not grow too much but it does 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.790
 something the according player is eric botteghin 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 a good central against that already 74 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 serious business is already quite high for one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 good defender of FC Groningen 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.100
 this year he is going to the final in between 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 a point up I think so eh 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 biased statistics is slightly up 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.070
 and its physical looks like such 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.040
 the rest is not too bad, they are easter 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.100
 maybe not but okay 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.090
 the for the player is better for them 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.520
 young ado 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 made a lot of goals so yes 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 the step to enemy is justified and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.130
 also have anti 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 fighting with kassim bridget his hands 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.759
 I think the camo is at least 15 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.619
 goals to go this season 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 you should definitely be able to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.009
 And well yes she's racing is what is allowed 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.110
 are the drip everything is kind of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 up, because that is of course considerable 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.350
 in high in terms of rating so you should too 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 of course wa statistics also what 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.470
 up 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.350
 let this play today and that is from 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
 a brook swim 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.579
 yeah just 68 overall that's way too 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.079
 little for him of course I grow ice 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.539
 have made him gold that the doubt will 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.700
 i got him virus 17 then or 75 i have 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.590
 martijn 75 done the same faster 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.149
 remained, but I find his fitting 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.069
 greatly improved sr defend in the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.840
 statistics of course physical too 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.970
 and yes this was the weather you thought it was 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.110
 nice leaves a like behind and never again 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.450
 of this season 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.260

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.260
