I've<00:00:11.959> always<00:00:12.139> had<00:00:12.289> an<00:00:12.440> interest<00:00:12.740> in<00:00:12.920> the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
I've always had an interest in the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.950 
I've always had an interest in the
natural<00:00:13.370> world<00:00:13.460> so<00:00:13.940> I<00:00:13.969> just<00:00:14.179> really<00:00:14.450> always

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
natural world so I just really always

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.560 
natural world so I just really always
had<00:00:15.769> an<00:00:16.040> affinity<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:16.880> being<00:00:17.090> outside<00:00:17.300> and

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
had an affinity to being outside and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.690 
had an affinity to being outside and
I've<00:00:18.349> always<00:00:18.650> loved<00:00:18.890> animals<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.430> knew<00:00:19.550> that

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
I've always loved animals and knew that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.979 
I've always loved animals and knew that
I<00:00:19.730> wanted<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:20.150> do<00:00:20.270> something<00:00:20.689> with<00:00:20.779> animals

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:20.989 
I wanted to do something with animals

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.839 
I wanted to do something with animals
and<00:00:21.529> when<00:00:22.040> I<00:00:22.070> learned<00:00:22.189> about<00:00:22.369> being<00:00:22.700> a

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
and when I learned about being a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.670 
and when I learned about being a
conservation<00:00:23.360> biologist<00:00:23.390> that<00:00:24.079> seems<00:00:24.320> like<00:00:24.500> a

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
conservation biologist that seems like a

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.589 
conservation biologist that seems like a
good<00:00:24.829> fit<00:00:25.099> for<00:00:25.130> me<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:25.460> get<00:00:25.759> to<00:00:25.790> be<00:00:25.939> outside<00:00:26.090> I

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
good fit for me I get to be outside I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.139 
good fit for me I get to be outside I
get<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:26.989> do<00:00:27.739> work<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:28.669> think<00:00:28.730> really<00:00:29.090> makes

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.740 

we're<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.880> in<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.090> area<00:00:57.240> because<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we're here in this area because this is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.390 
we're here in this area because this is
actually<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.290> last<00:00:58.470> remaining<00:00:58.860> population

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
actually the last remaining population

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually the last remaining population
of<00:00:59.640> breeding<00:01:00.270> burrowing<00:01:00.480> owls<00:01:00.720> in<00:01:00.960> San<00:01:01.170> Diego

of breeding burrowing owls in San Diego
County<00:01:01.560> and<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:02.910> trying<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> help<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
County and so we're trying to help the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.360 
County and so we're trying to help the
land<00:01:04.050> managers<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.739> understand<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
land managers here understand the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.130 
land managers here understand the
population<00:01:05.729> better<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.720> better

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
population better so that we can better

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.290 
population better so that we can better
conserve<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> future<00:01:08.300> burrowing

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
conserve them for the future burrowing

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.880 
conserve them for the future burrowing
owls<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.930> awesome<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.320> owls<00:01:10.800> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
owls are these awesome little owls that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
owls are these awesome little owls that
live<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.640> ground<00:01:11.880> they're<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.300> only<00:01:12.479> owl

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
live in the ground they're the only owl

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
live in the ground they're the only owl
in<00:01:12.990> North<00:01:13.170> America<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.710> lives<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> burrows

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
in North America that lives in burrows

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
in North America that lives in burrows
in<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.580> ground<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.270> only<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:16.020> six

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in the ground there are only about six

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
in the ground there are only about six
inches<00:01:16.920> tall<00:01:17.190> they're<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.700> tall<00:01:17.910> at<00:01:18.060> all

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
inches tall they're not very tall at all

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.300 
inches tall they're not very tall at all
so<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.780> fit<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.080> palm<00:01:19.260> of<00:01:19.410> my<00:01:19.500> hand

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.130 

burrowing<00:01:26.310> owls<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.930> burrows<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
burrowing owls need burrows in the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
burrowing owls need burrows in the
ground<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.740> usually<00:01:29.340> they're<00:01:29.490> dug<00:01:29.700> by<00:01:29.910> ground

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
ground and usually they're dug by ground

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
ground and usually they're dug by ground
squirrels<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.080> prairie<00:01:31.590> dogs<00:01:31.830> or<00:01:32.070> other

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
squirrels or prairie dogs or other

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.440 
squirrels or prairie dogs or other
animals<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.880> dig<00:01:33.090> burrows

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
animals that dig burrows

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.540 
animals that dig burrows
we<00:01:33.720> call<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:33.990> fossil<00:01:34.440> real<00:01:34.619> animals<00:01:35.070> because

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
we call them fossil real animals because

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.210 
we call them fossil real animals because
of<00:01:35.880> people<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.810> liking<00:01:37.050> them<00:01:37.590> digging<00:01:38.040> holes

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
of people not liking them digging holes

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.440 
of people not liking them digging holes
in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> ground<00:01:38.580> they've<00:01:38.790> gotten<00:01:39.119> rid<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.300> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in the ground they've gotten rid of a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450 
in the ground they've gotten rid of a
lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.720> those<00:01:39.930> animals<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:40.800> now<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> owls

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
lot of those animals and so now the owls

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
lot of those animals and so now the owls
don't<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.090> homes<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.690> they<00:01:42.840> need

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
don't really have homes that they need

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.290 
don't really have homes that they need
we<00:01:43.410> are<00:01:43.649> trying<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.250> build<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.820> habitat

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
we are trying to build better habitat

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.960 
we are trying to build better habitat
for<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:46.110> building<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.550> grassland

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
for them by building more more grassland

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
for them by building more more grassland
and<00:01:48.090> by<00:01:48.330> building<00:01:48.539> burrows<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.410> can

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and by building burrows that they can

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.770 
and by building burrows that they can
live<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.970 

we're<00:01:59.780> trapping<00:01:59.990> owls<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.560> able<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:00.830> put

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
we're trapping owls to be able to put

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.980 
we're trapping owls to be able to put
leg<00:02:01.160> bands<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.700> GPS<00:02:02.060> data<00:02:02.360> loggers<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.810> them

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
leg bands and GPS data loggers on them

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.050 
leg bands and GPS data loggers on them
in<00:02:03.410> order<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.890> trap<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> owls<00:02:04.580> we<00:02:04.850> take

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
in order to trap the owls we take

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.400 
in order to trap the owls we take
advantage<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> fact<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.050> they<00:02:06.200> like

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
advantage of the fact that they like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.450 
advantage of the fact that they like
their<00:02:06.590> burrows<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.920> they're<00:02:07.040> very<00:02:07.160> tied<00:02:07.430> to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
their burrows and they're very tied to

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.160 
their burrows and they're very tied to
their<00:02:07.730> burrows<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:08.420> set<00:02:08.570> up<00:02:08.690> little<00:02:08.840> traps

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
their burrows so we set up little traps

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.110 
their burrows so we set up little traps
at<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> Burrow<00:02:09.740> entrances<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:10.970> when

them back to the vehicle and we do a
whole<00:02:31.840> processing<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.370> Owls<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.850> we<00:02:34.000> weigh

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
whole processing of the Owls so we weigh

them we measure take different body
measurements<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.760> them<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.330> apply<00:02:37.570> leg<00:02:37.900> bands

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.090 
burrowing owls we have to use GPS data
loggers<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.720> them<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.020> as<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> little

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100

it's<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.500> pretty<00:03:32.650> hot<00:03:32.830> topic<00:03:33.190> right<00:03:33.220> now<00:03:33.549> and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it's a pretty hot topic right now and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's a pretty hot topic right now and
we're<00:03:34.180> lucky<00:03:34.480> enough<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.380> population

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
of breeding owls here and I think that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.210 
of breeding owls here and I think that
it's<00:03:37.930> really<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.320> lot<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.530> people's<00:03:38.860> radar

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
it's really on a lot of people's radar

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.130 
it's really on a lot of people's radar
right<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:40.209> try<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.450> conserve<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.019> Owls

right now to try to conserve the Owls

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.780 
right now to try to conserve the Owls
that<00:03:41.380> we<00:03:41.470> have<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.010> because<00:03:42.459> we're<00:03:42.670> learning

that we have and because we're learning
so<00:03:43.180> much<00:03:43.330> about<00:03:43.390> these<00:03:43.750> owls<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.380> we're

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
so much about these owls I think we're

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.310 
so much about these owls I think we're
able<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:46.090> give<00:03:46.239> them<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.570> better<00:03:46.810> idea<00:03:47.019> of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
able to to give them a better idea of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.080 
able to to give them a better idea of
the<00:03:47.980> information<00:03:48.400> they<00:03:48.549> need<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.760> make

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090
