00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.860 

when<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.200> noticed<00:00:46.710> her<00:00:46.890> peak<00:00:47.750> she<00:00:48.750> was

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
when I first noticed her peak she was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
when I first noticed her peak she was
about<00:00:49.110> probably<00:00:50.210> three<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.239> four<00:00:51.329> weeks<00:00:51.660> old<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
about probably three or four weeks old I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.680 
about probably three or four weeks old I
think<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:56.239> thought<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> was

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
think and and I thought that it was

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
think and and I thought that it was
because<00:00:58.079> she<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.410> injured<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.010> she<00:00:59.070> was

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because she was injured when she was

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
because she was injured when she was
newly<00:01:00.359> hatched<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.210> chicks

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
newly hatched because one of my chicks

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.429 
newly hatched because one of my chicks
got<00:01:03.660> stepped<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:06.299> hand<00:01:06.540> stepped<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.320> her

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
got stepped on the hand stepped on her

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.380 
got stepped on the hand stepped on her
fur<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:10.820> knocked<00:01:11.820> her<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
know if that was this one or not because

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.070 
know if that was this one or not because
I<00:01:23.850> read<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.439> um<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> genetic<00:01:26.580> thing

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
I read that that um it's a genetic thing

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.980 
I read that that um it's a genetic thing
so<00:01:28.310> out<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:29.759> chicks<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> only

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so out of all my chicks this is the only

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
so out of all my chicks this is the only
one<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.250> big<00:01:32.759> problem<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:35.369> was

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
one that had this big problem that was

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
one that had this big problem that was
about<00:01:35.759> altogether<00:01:37.040> 3015<00:01:38.090> see<00:01:39.090> sugar<00:01:39.600> bear<00:01:39.810> had

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
about altogether 3015 see sugar bear had

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.480 
about altogether 3015 see sugar bear had
15<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> April<00:01:41.640> rose<00:01:41.850> by<00:01:42.479> 15<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
15 and April rose by 15 and this is the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
15 and April rose by 15 and this is the
only<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:49.100> did<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.369> eggs<00:01:50.820> from<00:01:51.259> Penelope

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
only one I did take eggs from Penelope

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.929 
only one I did take eggs from Penelope
and<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:52.710> him<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.070> sugar<00:01:53.280> bear<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and I put him on your sugar bear so I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
and I put him on your sugar bear so I
think<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> Penelope's

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think this could be one of Penelope's

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
think this could be one of Penelope's
babies<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:58.020> she's<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.380> stout<00:01:58.770> like

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
babies because she's very stout like

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:11.640 
babies because she's very stout like
like<00:01:59.430> Penelope<00:02:02.659> cookie

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.039
