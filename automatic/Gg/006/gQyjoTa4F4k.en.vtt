00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.780
 This time before the start of the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 map then I tell you that this is not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 is commented by me remember that pp 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 I helped me before with maps 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 Well, I checked the mail and there 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 a lot of emails that he sent me was 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 efe with subscriber maps that I 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 I still had not checked then 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.160
 right now like those maps I still 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 belong or is the videos me 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.090
 they belong since I paid him for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.579
 to do them then right now they're going to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.820
 listen to him again but he does not 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 videos for me but I have uploaded 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 I'm still going to start climbing 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 those maps and I still had not done it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 for lack of time 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.630
 ok I leave you with some of the commentary 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 efe is an adventure map that is 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.820
 pretty good is old Croatian islands 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 I think it is and it is converted from pc to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 xbox pretty good the story there what 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.490
 they are going to see 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.070
 efe explains them better there also 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.870
 this is all leave your comment leave your 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 important because these days I'm

 very active in what is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450

 everything of opc and until the next 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.260
 hello guys welcome to a new 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 language 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.250
 war jr I am and this time with a new 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.220
 adventure minecraft map as you know 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 we always live pending 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.660
 everyone who asks us and so on 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 etcetera and this time we have brought you more 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.500
 maps adventures I know they 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.690
 love too much there is called 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 backed by a subscriber and a fan 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.150
 it's called Croatian island and many of us have 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.440
 played let's start a map that 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 generated from pc to xbox then on the map 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.630
 in the beginning as you see in the video 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.060
 part of the story will appear 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.070
 the map where they have to continue reading 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.939
 the posters and one of the advantages that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.369
 has is that it is in Spanish and therefore read 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.849
 all the posters and they will go 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.430
 extending to a bit of history that 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.400
 what it is to win because you see 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.569
 to defeat the aspect that is the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.360
 villain of the map and then you play it 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.730
 map in adventure mode is to say that 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.310
 when you go to start the map you put it 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 in adventure mode and there are three levels 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.430
 easy medium and difficult also between 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.690
 strips that we do not move the privileges 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.910
 from the host 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.849
 to this I show them on video and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.819
 I also show you the story there for 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.769
 to read it if they want to know a 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.989
 little of the story in the video before 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 download the map and I personally 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.239
 I say that the map is complete with 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 a good story because most of 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.160
 some adventure maps are in 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.260
 English but it 's totally in Spanish and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.049
 I recommend it because 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.480
 I'm not so much to play maps of 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.060
 adventure but I liked it and if you do not go to 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.569
 play in multiplayer because there they 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.989
 shows and gives you some instructions 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.720
 They also teach us how to use 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.569
 stores that know how to give their object to 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.220
 change other good that already knows and 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.159
 it also has an achievement quarter 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 while you are passing the map then you have 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:33.879
 a quarter of achievement and how can you see in 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.370
 Some of them I'm explaining and I'm going 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.109
 to teach as well in the video as 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.750
 it's the depth 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.579
 you have challenges you have your challenges and 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.560
 the challenges do not have to be met and 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.720
 those challenges that will give the key that with 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.090
 that key you will be able to defeat and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.980
 fulfill the story so I leave you with 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.319
 part of the images of what is coming 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.139
 being the map remember to read all the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.180
 posters and if you liked it dale like comments 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.129
 if you want some other map if you have a 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.590
 good consumption map has turned a 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.480
 for the pc to xbox is not equality work to 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.040
 mail share social networks 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.720
 share your customers with your friends 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.230
 but the section I am boss and see you 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.230
 in another 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.790
 two
