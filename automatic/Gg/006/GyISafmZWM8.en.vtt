between the fourth and the fifth tree
that's<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.090> true<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.629> pretty

accurate let's say you're gonna set your
drag<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:07.890> two<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.310> three<00:01:08.369> depending<00:01:09.210> on

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
drag to about two or three depending on

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.270 
drag to about two or three depending on
how<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> type<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> tackle<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.830> using<00:01:14.010> to

rod in the reel which doesn't affect if

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990

you can catch the or hook the fish it's
rather<00:01:20.240> what's<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.479> important<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:25.250> if

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
rather what's more important is the if

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
rather what's more important is the if
you<00:01:26.280> want<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> horse<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.330> that's

really what's important so most of the
bikes<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> spot

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
bikes you're gonna get from this spot

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
haven't changed the time really I wanted

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730 
haven't changed the time really I wanted
to<00:01:41.430> demonstrate<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.090> technique<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to demonstrate the technique and that is

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
to demonstrate the technique and that is
lift<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> drop<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.909> using<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
lift and drop that I'm using which is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.469 
lift and drop that I'm using which is
reeling<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.950> slowly<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> three<00:01:48.149> drag

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
reeling pretty slowly with a three drag

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
reeling pretty slowly with a three drag
and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.409> right-clicking<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.610> up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and then right-clicking all the way up

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030

to the top of your your stroke so to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.969 
to the top of your your stroke so to
speak<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.820> bait<00:01:54.560> that's<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> the

more<00:01:56.219> effective<00:01:57.170> presentations<00:01:58.170> you've<00:01:58.380> been

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
more effective presentations you've been

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
more effective presentations you've been
used<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.920> land<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> trout<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.119> expect<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
used to land the trout I don't expect to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
used to land the trout I don't expect to
get<00:02:00.719> any<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.259> real<00:02:01.409> early<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
get any because it's real early in the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
get any because it's real early in the
morning<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.750> want

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
morning but that's really how you want

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.440 
morning but that's really how you want
to<00:02:04.079> present<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> bait<00:02:05.009> lift<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> drop<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to present the bait lift and drop and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
to present the bait lift and drop and
then<00:02:06.689> we'll<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> stop<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
then we'll do the stop and go for you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.570 
then we'll do the stop and go for you
and<00:02:09.319> I'll<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.470> doing<00:02:10.590> separate<00:02:10.979> videos<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.459> how

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and I'll be doing separate videos on how

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.210 
and I'll be doing separate videos on how
to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.819> those<00:02:11.970> techniques

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
to do those techniques

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.950 
to do those techniques
this<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.820> typically<00:02:14.240> what<00:02:14.390> you're<00:02:14.540> gonna<00:02:14.660> do

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
this is typically what you're gonna do

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.370 
this is typically what you're gonna do
with<00:02:15.200> your<00:02:16.130> presentation<00:02:16.580> now<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.170> get

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
with your presentation now as you get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.120 
with your presentation now as you get
into<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:20.240> know<00:02:20.360> 50<00:02:20.840> feet<00:02:21.140> you're<00:02:21.740> gonna<00:02:21.830> have

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
into you know 50 feet you're gonna have

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.980 
into you know 50 feet you're gonna have
to<00:02:22.340> vary<00:02:22.670> your<00:02:22.760> presentation<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> little<00:02:23.840> bit

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
to vary your presentation a little bit

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
to vary your presentation a little bit
and<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.350> would<00:02:24.410> recommend<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.370> change<00:02:26.090> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and I would recommend that you change it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
and I would recommend that you change it
up<00:02:26.480> sometimes<00:02:27.050> about<00:02:27.380> halfway<00:02:27.620> through

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
up sometimes about halfway through

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.800 
up sometimes about halfway through
because<00:02:28.760> you're<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.150> gonna<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.450> able<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
because you're not gonna be able to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.960 
because you're not gonna be able to
carry<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.200> lift<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.620> drop<00:02:30.770> very<00:02:31.070> easily<00:02:31.370> until

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
carry a lift and drop very easily until

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.570 
carry a lift and drop very easily until
you<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.210> lot<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> practice<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:34.250> let<00:02:34.430> you're

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
you have a lot of practice we let you're

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.160 
you have a lot of practice we let you're
reeling<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.000> all<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.240> way<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.780> getting<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
reeling it all the way in and getting a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.780 
reeling it all the way in and getting a
three<00:02:36.530> presents<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.100> three<00:02:37.400> white<00:02:37.580> dot

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
three presents a three white dot

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.090 
three presents a three white dot
presentation<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.570> whole<00:02:38.720> way<00:02:38.870> through<00:02:39.100> we'll

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
presentation the whole way through we'll

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.370 
presentation the whole way through we'll
just<00:02:40.310> go<00:02:40.460> ahead<00:02:40.550> for<00:02:41.000> SS<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.450> G's<00:02:41.630> skip<00:02:42.230> our

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
just go ahead for SS and G's skip our

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.270 
just go ahead for SS and G's skip our
time<00:02:43.150> jus<00:02:44.200> 10<00:02:45.200> a.m.<00:02:45.440> which<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.709> typically<00:02:46.100> when

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
time jus 10 a.m. which is typically when

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.740 
time jus 10 a.m. which is typically when
they<00:02:46.400> start<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.820> bite<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:48.860> because

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
they start to bite and that's because

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.170 
they start to bite and that's because
currently<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.870> can't<00:02:51.080> check<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:53.000> can't

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
currently you can't check you can't

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.770 
currently you can't check you can't
trust<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.680> chart<00:02:54.680> currently<00:02:55.270> yeah<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.300> expect

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
trust this chart currently yeah I expect

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.000 
trust this chart currently yeah I expect
it<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:56.959> patched<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:57.530> currently<00:02:57.890> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
it to be patched but currently it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.510 
it to be patched but currently it
doesn't<00:02:58.310> function<00:02:58.490> so<00:02:59.560> moving<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.680> we're

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
doesn't function so moving on we're

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.420 
doesn't function so moving on we're
gonna<00:03:01.640> cast<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.180> same<00:03:02.360> spot<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.810> just<00:03:03.020> did

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
gonna cast in the same spot we just did

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.740 
gonna cast in the same spot we just did
you<00:03:04.430> don't<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:04.760> need<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.060> cast<00:03:05.270> any<00:03:05.510> more

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
you don't really need to cast any more

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.190 
you don't really need to cast any more
than<00:03:05.900> 80<00:03:06.080> or<00:03:06.260> 90<00:03:06.590> feet<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.810> time<00:03:12.050> we'll

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
than 80 or 90 feet and this time we'll

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.820 
than 80 or 90 feet and this time we'll
do<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.440> stop<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.860> go<00:03:12.890> retrieve<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.830> start

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
do the stop and go retrieve so start

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.699 
do the stop and go retrieve so start
that<00:03:16.780> we'll<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:17.959> if<00:03:18.050> we<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.260> hook<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:18.590> up

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
that we'll see if we can hook one up

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.890 
that we'll see if we can hook one up
just<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.010> can<00:03:19.130> show<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.370> guys<00:03:19.750> most<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.840> the

three point seven to four point two

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.000 
three point seven to four point two
pounds<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.019> there's<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.290> hook<00:03:30.410> up<00:03:30.590> right<00:03:30.769> there

pounds and there's a hook up right there

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.380 
pounds and there's a hook up right there
and<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.370> little<00:03:31.519> bit<00:03:31.670> bigger<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.180> fish

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and it's a little bit bigger of a fish

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.750 
and it's a little bit bigger of a fish
what<00:03:32.690> we<00:03:32.810> still<00:03:33.019> would<00:03:33.170> seem<00:03:33.410> sometimes<00:03:34.190> trout

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
what we still would seem sometimes trout

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.920 
what we still would seem sometimes trout
can<00:03:34.970> be<00:03:35.090> deceiving<00:03:41.830> sometimes<00:03:42.830> their<00:03:43.930> size

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
can be deceiving sometimes their size
