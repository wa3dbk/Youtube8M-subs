00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone with you fil and in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.960
 I will try to answer a small video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.660
 to your questions that have appeared to you 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.090
 after the release of the video where he played on jaggeri 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.460
 I said there that I love going 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 jagger dagger no matter how funny it is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 sounded and you started immediately asking how 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.160
 so what dagger 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 are you talking about in general what he wants and he 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 all right now I'll show you why 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.189
 generally need a bug let's roll off on 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 20 seconds ago 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.280
 the fortieth minute of the game I have everything here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.309
 ok bkb desolator aganim here we are 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 the team here is trying to be someone 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.640
 an expert happened here interesting 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.309
 moment look carefully here we are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 here come the illusion emberus take off 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.930
 but fortunately no one landed 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
 serious I run he did not hear i'm ready 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.430
 here bryon farme look i'm flying 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 furion nearby by the way bladciker a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.439
 now comes out of my born 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.720
 Ultimate but die anyway 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 let's see in slow motion 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.909
 what happened here i run culture 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 curion and here is a seeker outside a radius of 200 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.460
 Malta 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.250
 but he doesn't die anyway anyway 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 need to be super some kind of proud 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 just be careful enough 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.710
 to see that i used blink in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.479
 this moment and cut and bloodseeker'a for 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.340
 the company if it were not yes I am ready 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.050
 furion would just die here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.620
 the moment of blink and drive off will be the ax 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.710
 since jagger can use items 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.440
 while jumping so dagger in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 Well, I don’t know, of course, it costs 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.400
 very expensive and if in principle not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.110
 thinks it 's just so free 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.290
 escape because it's not worth mana 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.780
 rolls back 12 seconds if just not 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.660
 thinks he helps us kill with 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.540
 ults then this is a very useful item. 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.750
 that allow us to run away to catch up 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.750
 rush in initiate and do all sorts 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.720
 other things, but generally very useful 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.330
 thing i'm not saying that you need to collect it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 always and everywhere in any game in all 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.860
 situations 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.250
 after all 2000 is like a little gold 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.350
 and Vladimir it will be much more useful in 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 certain situations and not worth it 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.630
 put together a dagger really first if you 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.220
 man think 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.680
 dagger first it does not make sense to you 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.790
 collect I collected it after must 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.980
 nafarmil bkb bison and naturally aganim 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.510
 now to the benefit of the daguer 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.270
 definitely has doubts enough 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.580
 constantly speed on the map of this one 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.370
 here 's a fish that diver me just 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.950
 so expensive and constantly provided 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.520
 ran away from me but you see what it is 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.130
 led 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.470
 it was not the best moment there 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.170
 just chop him two altogether 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.630
 imagine you jump there in 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.720
 can anyone see your remote go 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.580
 in creeps or some not needed for 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.739
 you side don't go dagger and all 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.560
 Normally you need a little knack for 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.450
 I don't always succeed but this 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.600
 the moment turned out let's mate him for 50 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.350
 the minute there was the same similar moment 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.290
 him somewhere here are going to go on 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.870
 high ground under the cars to do it 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:43.140
 very simply don't know the glyph here is the rumen 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:47.190
 flies in and now exactly 50 minutes 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:54.170
 start the kneading come running mortred bkb here 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:57.480
 somewhere somewhere somewhere here at this moment 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.630
 it will break out now turn on bkb 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.210
 bitch to try and lenses to pass 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.060
 Shingo opens Mortra see I'm in 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.130
 He run up to start her ultovat 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.190
 I cut and with the help of blink 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.130
 I am already moving to the ax and the siker 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.230
 drives off it look very impressive 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.140
 agree and quite unusual I am very 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.500
 rarely you probably never even saw 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.690
 I don’t know me for a coat of arms 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.150
 I would like to do it normally 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.370
 blink on jagger if everything is chocolate 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.250
 if there are main topics then why would 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.540
 no very very nice artifact 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.120
 I hope you have no more questions on 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.870
 about this and I helped someone 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.240
 be answered by what interested him 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.130
 but in terms of diver, now I think everyone 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680
 understandable in essence, it can be collected by any 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.430
 the hero of which there is no escape of or there 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.580
 any other moving mechanisms if 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.040
 You can say very very well 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.700
 walks in with you was call thanks 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.130
 watched 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.350
 leave your comments and ratings that 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.350
 do you think about it all bye
