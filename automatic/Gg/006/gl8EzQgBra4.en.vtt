00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
talk to me about you know why it is that

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.210 
talk to me about you know why it is that
you<00:00:03.300> guys<00:00:03.419> are<00:00:03.570> so<00:00:03.750> focused<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.410> this

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
you guys are so focused on this

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.120 
you guys are so focused on this
industrial<00:00:05.640> uses<00:00:06.210> right<00:00:06.629> here<00:00:07.130> yeah

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
industrial uses right here yeah

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
industrial uses right here yeah
absolutely<00:00:08.370> great<00:00:08.730> question<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.360> what

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
absolutely great question you know what

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.900 
absolutely great question you know what
we're<00:00:10.080> really<00:00:10.559> focusing<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> future

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we're really focusing on is the future

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
we're really focusing on is the future
of<00:00:11.940> work<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.929> work<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:14.280> think

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
of work and what work is and we think

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.310 
of work and what work is and we think
that<00:00:14.490> augmented<00:00:14.910> reality<00:00:14.940> strength<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that augmented reality strength is the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.740 
that augmented reality strength is the
opportunity<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.920> empower<00:00:17.160> workers<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:18.630> make

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
opportunity to empower workers to make

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.599 
opportunity to empower workers to make
better<00:00:18.900> decisions<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.980> context<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> what

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
better decisions in the context of what

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.429 
better decisions in the context of what
they're<00:00:20.730> doing<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.180> mean<00:00:21.330> today<00:00:21.869> most

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
they're doing I mean today most

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
they're doing I mean today most
management<00:00:23.220> paradigms<00:00:23.519> assume<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
management paradigms assume that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.460 
management paradigms assume that
management<00:00:24.480> makes<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> decision<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> worker

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
management makes a decision in a worker

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.710 
management makes a decision in a worker
either<00:00:25.800> gets<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.519> wrong<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
either gets it right or wrong but if you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
either gets it right or wrong but if you
can<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:27.990> augmented<00:00:28.410> reality<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:29.220> give<00:00:29.609> them

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
can use augmented reality to give them

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
can use augmented reality to give them
the<00:00:30.029> best<00:00:30.210> information<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.260> they

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the best information they don't they

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
the best information they don't they
don't<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> mistake<00:00:32.340> they'll

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
don't want to make a mistake they'll

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
don't want to make a mistake they'll
make<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> right<00:00:33.510> decisions<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> an

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
make the right decisions and an

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.930 
make the right decisions and an
augmented<00:00:35.100> reality<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.520> help<00:00:35.670> make<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
augmented reality can help make that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
augmented reality can help make that
happen<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.390> maybe<00:00:36.840> there's<00:00:37.110> more<00:00:37.170> revenue

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
happen and maybe there's more revenue

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
happen and maybe there's more revenue
when<00:00:37.890> you're<00:00:38.010> talking<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> businesses<00:00:38.879> about

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
when you're talking to businesses about

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900 
when you're talking to businesses about
fixing<00:00:39.840> their<00:00:39.960> business<00:00:40.290> yeah<00:00:41.219> absolutely<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
fixing their business yeah absolutely I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
fixing their business yeah absolutely I
mean<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> market<00:00:42.629> opportunity<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.649> AR<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
mean the market opportunity for AR is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
mean the market opportunity for AR is
huge<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> idea<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
huge if you look at kind of the idea of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
huge if you look at kind of the idea of
the<00:00:46.890> Internet<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> Things<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.789> connecting

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the Internet of Things and connecting

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
the Internet of Things and connecting
machines<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.590> people<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.280> data<00:00:50.610> together<00:00:50.820> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
machines and people and data together in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.920 
machines and people and data together in
the<00:00:51.210> world

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the world

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
the world
the<00:00:52.230> opportunity<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.460> really

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the opportunity it can can really

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
the opportunity it can can really
approach<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> trillions<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> dollars<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
approach the trillions of dollars and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.319 
approach the trillions of dollars and
augmented<00:00:56.010> reality<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> user

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
augmented reality is really the user

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.599 
augmented reality is really the user
interface<00:00:57.840> bringing<00:00:58.530> those<00:00:59.129> things<00:00:59.460> together

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
interface bringing those things together

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.900 
interface bringing those things together
and<00:01:00.149> making<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.809> actionable<00:01:01.260> Josh<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and making them actionable Josh when you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
and making them actionable Josh when you
look<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.840> startup<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.739> many<00:01:04.920> others

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
second-floor window no we're not going

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
second-floor window no we're not going
to<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.810> era<00:01:24.930> black<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> said<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.310> we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to that era black but I said what are we

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.620 
to that era black but I said what are we
looking<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.850> Brian<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.390> look<00:01:27.509> at

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
looking at there Brian when I look at

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
looking at there Brian when I look at
this<00:01:27.720> thing<00:01:27.900> why<00:01:28.290> does<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> helmet<00:01:28.920> look

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this thing why does that helmet look

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
this thing why does that helmet look
like<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.600> yeah<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.049> smart<00:01:31.259> helmet<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> has

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like that yeah the smart helmet it has

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
like that yeah the smart helmet it has
an<00:01:32.340> array<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> sensors<00:01:32.820> built<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
an array of sensors built into it and a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
an array of sensors built into it and a
computing<00:01:34.770> platform<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.759> allows<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
computing platform that allows the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
computing platform that allows the
helmet<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.650> computer<00:01:38.100> vision<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
helmet to do computer vision so the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
helmet to do computer vision so the
computer<00:01:39.900> understands<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.770> sees<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
computer understands what it sees it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
computer understands what it sees it
understands<00:01:41.700> how<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> helmets<00:01:42.240> moving<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
understands how the helmets moving and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.280 
understands how the helmets moving and
then<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.009> perform<00:01:44.250> augmented<00:01:44.939> reality<00:01:45.290> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
then it can perform augmented reality in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
then it can perform augmented reality in
addition<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.890> bringing<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
addition to bringing in the the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
addition to bringing in the the
information<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> sensors<00:01:49.140> provide<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
information that the sensors provide you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.170 
information that the sensors provide you
know<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.610> instance<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
know for instance one of the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.580 
know for instance one of the
capabilities<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> smart<00:01:52.140> helmet<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
capabilities in the smart helmet is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
capabilities in the smart helmet is
actually<00:01:53.040> thermal<00:01:53.430> vision<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.630> see

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
actually thermal vision so you can see

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
actually thermal vision so you can see
what<00:01:55.619> temperature<00:01:56.100> things<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.090> by

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
what temperature things are just just by

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
what temperature things are just just by
looking<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.560> becomes<00:01:58.890> immensely

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
looking at them which becomes immensely

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
looking at them which becomes immensely
valuable<00:01:59.640> both<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> production

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
valuable both from a production

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.359 
valuable both from a production
standpoint<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.770> also<00:02:01.860> from<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.189> safety

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
standpoint but also from a safety

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.010 
standpoint but also from a safety
standpoint<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> approach<00:02:03.509> something<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
standpoint if you approach something and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
standpoint if you approach something and
it's<00:02:04.110> too<00:02:04.560> hot<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> helmet<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.310> actually<00:02:05.670> let

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
it's too hot the helmet can actually let

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.310 
it's too hot the helmet can actually let
you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> there's<00:02:06.509> there's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> danger

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you know that there's there's a danger

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.150 
you know that there's there's a danger
there<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:09.090> interesting<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.720> uh<00:02:10.160> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
there and very interesting because uh it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.559 
there and very interesting because uh it
seems<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.610> Josh<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
seems that Josh you know one of the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.830 
seems that Josh you know one of the
things

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
things

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
things
we<00:02:12.930> know<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.709> work<00:02:13.950> happens<00:02:14.519> now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we know about the way work happens now

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.030 
we know about the way work happens now
that's<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.480> different<00:02:15.959> from<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.830> an

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that's so different from you know an

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
that's so different from you know an
industrial<00:02:17.610> age<00:02:17.819> where<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.209> had<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:19.110> few

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
industrial age where you had very few

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.770 
industrial age where you had very few
educated<00:02:20.220> managers<00:02:21.650> managing<00:02:22.700> vast<00:02:23.780> numbers

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
educated managers managing vast numbers

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.940 
educated managers managing vast numbers
of<00:02:24.810> people<00:02:25.080> who<00:02:25.470> didn't<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.800> an<00:02:25.890> education

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
of people who didn't have an education

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
of people who didn't have an education
and<00:02:26.489> therefore<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.819> jobs<00:02:27.060> were<00:02:27.269> all<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> same

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and therefore the jobs were all the same

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.119 
and therefore the jobs were all the same
and<00:02:27.690> everything<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.500> seems<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.920> it's

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
and everything this seems like it's

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.880 
and everything this seems like it's
focused<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.970> old<00:02:30.239> world<00:02:30.599> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.620> job

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
focused on that old world kind of job

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.289 
focused on that old world kind of job
where<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> worker<00:02:32.549> didn't<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.090> enough

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
where the worker didn't have enough

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.600 
where the worker didn't have enough
information<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.440> time<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.340> moment

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
information at the time of the moment

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.530 
information at the time of the moment
they're<00:02:35.700> doing<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:35.940> job<00:02:37.220> yeah<00:02:38.220> look<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.610> there

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
they're doing the job yeah look we there

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.410 
they're doing the job yeah look we there
are<00:02:39.720> still<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.280> million<00:02:41.760> tens<00:02:42.120> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
are still you know million tens and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.850 
are still you know million tens and
hundreds<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.810> interviewing<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> doing<00:02:43.739> these

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
hundreds of interviewing and doing these

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.680 
hundreds of interviewing and doing these
kind<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.640> labor<00:02:44.910> work<00:02:45.269> every<00:02:45.660> day

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
kind of you know labor work every day

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
kind of you know labor work every day
and<00:02:46.140> yet<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.160> still<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.489> look

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and yet you know we still have to look

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.789 
and yet you know we still have to look
at<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> analog<00:02:48.209> world<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> old<00:02:49.590> way

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
at the analog world in in the old way

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.259 
at the analog world in in the old way
and<00:02:50.069> we<00:02:50.160> think<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.849> when<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> can

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
and we think that you know when you can

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.699 
and we think that you know when you can
kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> digitize<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.959> information<00:02:52.650> of

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
kind of digitize that information of

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.080 
kind of digitize that information of
what<00:02:52.860> you're<00:02:52.980> seeing<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.459> give<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.000> people

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
what you're seeing and give it to people

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000 
what you're seeing and give it to people
in<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> much<00:02:54.630> more<00:02:54.840> digestible<00:02:55.049> way<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.920> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
in a much more digestible way and in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
in a much more digestible way and in
fact<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.459> know<00:02:56.579> if<00:02:57.000> something<00:02:57.480> looks<00:02:57.870> wrong

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
fact you know if something looks wrong

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.199 
fact you know if something looks wrong
on<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> chart<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.400> give<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> big<00:02:59.970> red

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
on a chart you know give you a big red

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.850 
on a chart you know give you a big red
warning<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.079> be<00:03:01.170> detected<00:03:01.709> through

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
warning and it can be detected through

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.350 
warning and it can be detected through
the<00:03:02.310> screen<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.910> think<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.209> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the screen we just think that this is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.330 
the screen we just think that this is
going<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.569> revolutionize<00:03:03.780> how<00:03:04.769> people<00:03:05.160> work

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
going to revolutionize how people work

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.220 
going to revolutionize how people work
and<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:06.090> excited<00:03:06.450> about<00:03:06.510> daiquiri<00:03:07.079> and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and we are excited about daiquiri and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.930 
and we are excited about daiquiri and
many<00:03:07.410> other<00:03:07.590> companies<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.280> are<00:03:08.700> really

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
many other companies that are really

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.970 
many other companies that are really
trying<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.660> inventive<00:03:10.110> here<00:03:10.349> both<00:03:10.799> at

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
trying to be the inventive here both at

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.800 
trying to be the inventive here both at

kind<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.269> as<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.420> think<00:03:21.690> about<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.260> as

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
kind of as you think about this just as

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.930 
kind of as you think about this just as
enterprise<00:03:22.739> business<00:03:23.160> are<00:03:23.310> there<00:03:23.700> bigger

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
enterprise business are there bigger

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.370 
enterprise business are there bigger
place<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.329> sort<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.720> how<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.170> map

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
place and sort of how we can map

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.289 
place and sort of how we can map
information<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.160> broader<00:03:26.400> world<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.060> or

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
information in the broader world to or

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.849 
information in the broader world to or
do<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.690> think<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.739> going

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
do you think this is really just going

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.240 
do you think this is really just going
to<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:29.040> focused<00:03:29.819> on<00:03:29.940> making<00:03:30.239> work<00:03:30.630> better<00:03:31.250> it's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
to be focused on making work better it's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.440 
to be focused on making work better it's
a<00:03:32.430> great<00:03:32.609> question<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.150> there's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
a great question I think that there's

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.690 
a great question I think that there's
really<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.810> clear<00:03:34.410> extension<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.489> what<00:03:35.609> we're

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
really a clear extension of what we're

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
really a clear extension of what we're
doing<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.660> industrial<00:03:37.079> workplace<00:03:37.440> today

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
doing in the industrial workplace today

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
doing in the industrial workplace today
it<00:03:37.920> moves<00:03:38.670> through<00:03:39.000> other<00:03:39.359> types<00:03:39.630> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
it moves through other types of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.289 
it moves through other types of
workplaces<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:41.370> ultimately<00:03:41.639> gets<00:03:42.120> into

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
workplaces and then ultimately gets into

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.360 
workplaces and then ultimately gets into
our<00:03:42.359> daily<00:03:42.599> lives<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.959> mean<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:43.230> I'm<00:03:43.889> sure

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
our daily lives I mean because I'm sure

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.849 
our daily lives I mean because I'm sure
like<00:03:44.519> me<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:46.019> what<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:46.380> because<00:03:46.530> you

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
like me you do what you do because you

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.110 
like me you do what you do because you
love<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.370> you're<00:03:47.459> passionate<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.849> it

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
love it and you're passionate about it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
love it and you're passionate about it
you<00:03:48.359> know<00:03:48.480> it's<00:03:48.690> where<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.049> leave<00:03:49.530> your<00:03:49.560> mark

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
you know it's where you leave your mark

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.080 
you know it's where you leave your mark
in<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.010> world<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.280> work<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.000> way

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
in the world I think work is that way

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.229 
in the world I think work is that way
for<00:03:51.239> everyone<00:03:51.419> and<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:52.319> kind<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.370> bleeds<00:03:54.030> over

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
for everyone and it kind of bleeds over

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.490 
for everyone and it kind of bleeds over
into<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.599> rest<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.870> your<00:03:54.959> life<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
into the rest of your life I think the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.930 
into the rest of your life I think the
technology<00:03:55.739> does<00:03:56.099> that<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.609> starts

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
technology does that as well it starts

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.610 
technology does that as well it starts
at<00:03:57.060> work<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.660> cell<00:03:57.870> phones<00:03:57.900> did<00:03:58.260> 30<00:03:58.560> years

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
at work like cell phones did 30 years

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.620 
at work like cell phones did 30 years
ago<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.130> then<00:03:59.940> eventually<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.480> in

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
ago and then eventually it's in

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.589 
ago and then eventually it's in
everybody's<00:04:01.230> pocket<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.859> case

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
everybody's pocket in this case

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.699 
everybody's pocket in this case
augmented<00:04:03.599> reality<00:04:03.630> will<00:04:04.349> be<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.530> everybody's

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
augmented reality will be on everybody's

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.150 
augmented reality will be on everybody's
head

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
head

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.400
