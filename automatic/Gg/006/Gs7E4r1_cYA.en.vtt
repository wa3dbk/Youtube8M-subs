00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 we see the Salvador Carnival with 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.910
 every respect we see the images all over 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.910
 world 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.510
 but we do not see motherhood nine 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.000
 months after the lonely girls without 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.450
 their parents having to give birth to their 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.180
 alone or those who have been 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.950
 infected with HIV virus 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.720
 those who have been contaminated'm not 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.590
 saying there is no joy 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.270
 I'm not saying that, I do not admire anyone. 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.520
 be able to live all that joy 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.620
 in a healthy way 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.170
 I'm saying it's when our 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.960
 authorities look to us for olh찾o 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.729
 you and I believe you are men and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.720
 almost level with women. 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.820
 animals 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.589
 if you do not give a condom to you 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.589
 they will not know how to live the restriction 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.460
 this is ridiculous 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.880
 this is ridiculous 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 the condom can even preserve the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.490
 aids unwanted pregnancies but does not 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 preserves deciding whether a prostitute 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.930
 after it's all over 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.930
 preservation, no one is free 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.800
 the best of this preservation 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.630
 No one, this preservation, no one has 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.110
 that our authorities often 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.750
 they look at us and do not believe in 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.080
 possibility of us being whole and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 owners of us at that time but are 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.840
 Paulo is tough that young tim처teo 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.009
 so much so that there is a beautiful passage that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.759
 we already got on it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.770
 no one to despise for being young but 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.310
 otherwise becomes a model for the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 others to give a moral lesson is not to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.550
 you show with your life with your 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.340
 testimony that you need not be 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.170
 flush 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.179
 what god can do great things to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.459
 from you that you are not an animal 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:14.520
 without taming that you decided to live under the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.510
 the highest protection and you have the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.790
 same frailties as all the others 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.940
 but you do not detach yourself from the certainty of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 What god is acting in your life if 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.310
 strengthening so that you can all 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.819
 that you have the right to look at this 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.819
 world of front 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.790
 S찾o Paulo's request to tim처teo is this 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.860
 For God's sake mark yourself the after 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.220
 You make all your fighting effort. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.290
 as an athlete to fight as a farmer who 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.000
 plays there only seed cares for her with 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.260
 quite keen 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.680
 after you are already forwarded 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 in the good way in the fight and in the good fight 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.960
 Timothy will tell others what 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.210
 happened to you will witness will 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.600
 say to those who are deprived of joy 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.140
 will tell those who are deprived of 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.120
 satisfaction of being people will announce 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.330
 in their ear that their lives can 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.860
 be different too 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.350
 so you take a step 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.600
 Do you believe in what God can do in? 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.150
 you you discover that you were one 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.040
 A better person than after you stopped 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.110
 to prostitute yourself socially 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.220
 networks cover the value of your body 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.290
 value of their sexuality that after 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.600
 You threw your drug away that you 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.830
 assumed with his family a commitment 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.560
 out of this drug addiction that this 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.630
 after you find a way to control 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.930
 their vices judge them in a corner in 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.180
 that you can keep it under you 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.390
 will tell your friends what God 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.880
 It's done on you because that's the best. 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.090
 present that we can receive from a 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.700
 to receive from him the testimony of what 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.780
 God did in his life because you have 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.780
 power to convince
