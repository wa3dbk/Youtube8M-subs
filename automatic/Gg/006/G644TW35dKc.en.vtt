mantlet<00:01:18.420> sand<00:01:18.659> such<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.420> two

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
mantlet sand such you actually have two

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.530 
mantlet sand such you actually have two
turrets<00:01:21.840> no<00:01:22.470> two<00:01:22.770> separate<00:01:23.280> turret<00:01:24.090> sides<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
turrets no two separate turret sides so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
turrets no two separate turret sides so
there's<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> goes<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.619> them<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's one that goes on all of them and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.899 
there's one that goes on all of them and
then<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.740> one<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.100> early<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> mid<00:01:29.729> war

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
then to one that's for early and mid war

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.410 
then to one that's for early and mid war
i<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.570> relate<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:32.420> for

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
i think in one that's relate work for

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
i think in one that's relate work for
the<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:33.920> yet<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:36.619> whole<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
glue to so it it sticks and it doesn't

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.199 
glue to so it it sticks and it doesn't
come<00:02:41.470> apart<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:42.069> such<00:02:43.109> just<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:45.160> nice<00:02:45.640> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
weight the way it slots in it allows you

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.089

supposed<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.519> glue<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.730> obviously<00:03:22.329> I<00:03:22.450> didn't

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
supposed to glue it obviously I didn't

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.800

neat<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.650> tracks<00:03:30.069> had<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.489> opposite<00:03:30.849> problem

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
neat the tracks had the opposite problem

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.699 
neat the tracks had the opposite problem
of<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.750> Sherman<00:03:32.250> which<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.599> they<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:38.230> bit

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709

of the Sherman which is they go on a bit
loose<00:03:39.220> they<00:03:39.609> not<00:03:39.790> they're<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.030> tight<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.709> you

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
loose they not they're not tight so you

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.379
