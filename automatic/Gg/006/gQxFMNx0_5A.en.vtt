anybody i just thought i'd make

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.690 
anybody i just thought i'd make
unichrome<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.469> yeah<00:02:07.649> pretty<00:02:07.890> much<00:02:07.979> insight<00:02:08.550> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
unichrome so yeah pretty much insight on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.080 
unichrome so yeah pretty much insight on
in<00:02:09.590> terms<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.800> size<00:02:11.280> he's<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:11.849> pretty

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
in terms of size he's actually pretty

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.270 
in terms of size he's actually pretty
much<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.450> pocket-sized

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
much like pocket-sized

much like pocket-sized
practically<00:02:15.420> um<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:18.940> see

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
practically um because as you can see

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.310 
practically um because as you can see
ureas<00:02:19.600> next<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.050> g1<00:02:21.040> run<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.790> mean<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.630> g1

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
ureas next to g1 run this mean you g1

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.800 
ureas next to g1 run this mean you g1
Rodimus<00:02:23.710> Prime<00:02:23.910> um<00:02:25.440> yeah<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.710> see<00:02:27.540> he's<00:02:28.540> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
Rodimus Prime um yeah you can see he's a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
Rodimus Prime um yeah you can see he's a
new<00:02:29.470> acronis<00:02:29.830> toe<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> bit<00:02:30.220> taller<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:30.790> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
new acronis toe a bit taller but and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
new acronis toe a bit taller but and
chunkier<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.210> stuff<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:35.010> yeah<00:02:36.010> he<00:02:36.190> should<00:02:36.730> be

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
chunkier and stuff but yeah he should be

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.900 
chunkier and stuff but yeah he should be
quite<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.210> lot<00:02:37.870> bigger<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.860> he's<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> be

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
quite a lot bigger if he's going to be

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.150 
quite a lot bigger if he's going to be
totally<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:41.410> show<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:43.740> cartoon<00:02:44.740> scale

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
totally I'm show a cartoon scale

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.630 
totally I'm show a cartoon scale
accurate<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.000> yeah<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.660> little<00:02:49.990> bit<00:02:50.050> small<00:02:50.350> but

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
accurate so yeah a little bit small but

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.760 
accurate so yeah a little bit small but
still<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.700> kind<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:53.140> yeah<00:02:53.590> it's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
still I kind of like so yeah it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.000 
still I kind of like so yeah it's
transformed<00:02:54.280> him<00:02:54.400> into<00:02:54.520> robot<00:02:55.030> mode<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:56.470> pop

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
transformed him into robot mode you pop

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.600 
transformed him into robot mode you pop
them<00:02:57.130> off<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.460> his<00:02:57.580> stand<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.140> take<00:02:59.350> these

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
them off of his stand and you take these

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.470 
them off of his stand and you take these
pieces<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:01.330> ring<00:03:01.540> piece<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:03.040> tab<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.880> from

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
pieces the ring piece is on tab it from

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.130 
pieces the ring piece is on tab it from
each<00:03:04.600> other<00:03:06.210> then<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.450> fold<00:03:07.630> these<00:03:07.750> out

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
each other then you just fold these out

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.840 
each other then you just fold these out
you<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.620> adjust<00:03:08.770> these<00:03:09.070> however<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.520> want<00:03:09.700> I

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
you can adjust these however you want I

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.370 
you can adjust these however you want I
like<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.180> fold<00:03:10.420> them<00:03:10.540> down<00:03:10.600> like<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:11.080> and

have the wings and you just fold them
down<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.410> little<00:03:17.590> bit<00:03:17.680> fold<00:03:18.640> down<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
down just a little bit fold down the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.740 
down just a little bit fold down the
legs<00:03:19.300> from<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.890> spend<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.100> new<00:03:21.250> ones<00:03:21.750> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
legs from here spend the new ones and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.560 
legs from here spend the new ones and
foot<00:03:23.170> forward<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.970> same<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.270> other<00:03:25.390> one

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
foot forward just same the other one

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.350 
foot forward just same the other one
bend<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:28.030> we<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.240> actually

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
bend it and that so we can actually

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.930 
bend it and that so we can actually
stand<00:03:28.780> then<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.500> take<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.709> arms<00:03:30.190> fold<00:03:30.730> them

then rotate his shoulders down then you
fold<00:03:38.590> these<00:03:38.920> wings<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.120> rest<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.450> way

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
fold these wings the rest of the way

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.680 
fold these wings the rest of the way

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
down and there you have Unicron in robot

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.090 
down and there you have Unicron in robot
mode<00:03:44.340> he's<00:03:45.660> pretty<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:47.100> pretty

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
cool-looking in robot mode not that

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.710 
cool-looking in robot mode not that
great<00:03:50.380> actually<00:03:50.650> um<00:03:51.330> because<00:03:52.330> he's<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.570> little
