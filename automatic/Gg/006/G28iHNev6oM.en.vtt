television<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> motion<00:00:29.190> pictures<00:00:29.610> are<00:00:29.760> alike

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
television and motion pictures are alike

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510 
television and motion pictures are alike
because<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.900> both<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.440> series<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> still

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
because in both a series of still

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.640 
because in both a series of still
pictures<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:33.210> flashed<00:00:33.540> rapidly<00:00:34.110> before<00:00:34.290> your

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
pictures is flashed rapidly before your

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.370 
pictures is flashed rapidly before your
eyes<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.700> rapidly<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.780> memory<00:00:37.080> of<00:00:37.170> each

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
eyes so rapidly that the memory of each

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.800 
eyes so rapidly that the memory of each
picture<00:00:37.740> lingers<00:00:38.280> long<00:00:38.550> enough<00:00:38.880> so<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
picture lingers long enough so that it

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.840 
picture lingers long enough so that it
blends<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.440> next<00:00:40.830> picture<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
blends with the next picture and the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.970 
blends with the next picture and the
object<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> picture<00:00:42.870> appears<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.470> move

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.860 

and<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.130> let's<00:00:47.430> see<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.700> makes<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> picture<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and now let's see what makes a picture a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
and now let's see what makes a picture a
picture<00:00:49.460> look<00:00:50.460> closely<00:00:50.790> at<00:00:51.150> this<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:52.340> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
picture look closely at this one the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.060 
picture look closely at this one the
closer<00:00:53.580> still<00:00:54.230> let's<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> magnifying

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
closer still let's use a magnifying

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
closer still let's use a magnifying
glass<00:00:56.720> here<00:00:57.720> we<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.620> picture<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
glass here we see that the picture is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
glass here we see that the picture is
really<00:00:59.490> made<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.000> thousands<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> tiny<00:01:01.110> dots

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
really made up of thousands of tiny dots

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.290 
really made up of thousands of tiny dots
arranged<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.460> close<00:01:02.820> together<00:01:05.300> but

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
arranged very close together but

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.510 
arranged very close together but
normally<00:01:06.780> our<00:01:06.990> eyes<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.590> notice<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> dots

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
normally our eyes don't notice the dots

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
normally our eyes don't notice the dots
especially<00:01:09.300> when<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> picture<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.080> being

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
especially when the picture is being

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
especially when the picture is being
moved<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.790> fact<00:01:12.210> helps<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:12.930> television

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
moved this fact helps to make television

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.820 
moved this fact helps to make television
and<00:01:13.800> motion<00:01:14.130> pictures<00:01:14.520> possible<00:01:15.830> television

is<00:01:16.950> simply<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.399> way<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> sending<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.390> dots

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is simply a way of sending these dots

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
is simply a way of sending these dots
from<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> transmitting<00:01:19.740> station<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.450> putting
