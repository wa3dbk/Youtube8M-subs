00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
believe so now it's actually three

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.719 
believe so now it's actually three
verses<00:01:26.509> 1<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.049> know<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:27.619> not<00:01:27.740> fair<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:28.100> at<00:01:28.579> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
verses 1 I know it's not fair but at the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.270 
verses 1 I know it's not fair but at the
scores<00:01:29.060> look<00:01:29.270> at<00:01:29.390> 29<00:01:29.810> 31<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.829> mean<00:01:31.159> it's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
scores look at 29 31 so I mean it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.020 
scores look at 29 31 so I mean it's
close<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.700> see<00:01:31.729> minigun<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.670> basically<00:01:34.670> yeah

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
close you see minigun and basically yeah

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.910 
close you see minigun and basically yeah
it<00:01:35.360> would<00:01:35.479> turn<00:01:35.600> into<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.899> 3d<00:01:36.290> one<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.770> last

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
it would turn into a 3d one for the last

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.840 
it would turn into a 3d one for the last
five<00:01:37.460> kills<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:37.969> guess<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:38.840> under<00:01:39.770> 35<00:01:40.280> 34

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.209 
we go unit 50 they swapped out abraxas
for<00:01:52.939> insidious<00:01:53.479> or<00:01:53.719> for<00:01:54.020> whatever<00:01:54.170> reason<00:01:54.829> the

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
for insidious or for whatever reason the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.910 
for insidious or for whatever reason the
city<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.579> played<00:01:55.850> instead<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.210> Abraxas<00:01:56.920> so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
city is played instead of Abraxas so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.139 
city is played instead of Abraxas so
insidious<00:01:58.909> he<00:02:00.399> isn't<00:02:01.399> exactly<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.939> best
