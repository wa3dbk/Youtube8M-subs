00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.940
 Chinchu..I call me Marionna, my dog ​​calls him Gol, 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 it's very big and that's why it's not here.

 My name is Ania and my bunny is called Charlie. 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.909
 At present, we know with certainty that the presence of pet helps children to be 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.520
 more sociable, in addition, you know there are special educational therapies with 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.590
 pets, for children and for 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.200
 people at risk of social exclusion, 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.540
 but not just that, 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.600
 pets develop the immune system of children, 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.420
 studies say that children who grow up with animals 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.870
 have a more competent immune system than those who did not have children around them. 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.490
 That's why pets play an important role in the house 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.819
 and do not doubt this, I encourage you because 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.969
 in the history of humanity, I have always coexisted with animals and, 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.459
 let's not forget that we are part of the animal kingdom.
