00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
however because of how many hollows i

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
however because of how many hollows i
tend<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> pull<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.460> decided<00:01:44.820> I'd<00:01:44.970> mix<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
tend to pull I decided I'd mix it up a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
tend to pull I decided I'd mix it up a
little<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> kind<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> shuffled<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
little bit so I kind of shuffled the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
little bit so I kind of shuffled the
rack<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.229> my

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
rack a little bit just just to see if my

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
rack a little bit just just to see if my
pull<00:01:50.220> rate<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.579> any<00:01:50.790> different<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pull rate would be any different so I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
pull rate would be any different so I
guess<00:01:51.540> we'll<00:01:51.689> test<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.049> theory<00:01:52.320> today<00:01:52.549> all

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
guess we'll test that theory today all

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.300 
guess we'll test that theory today all
right<00:01:53.729> we'll<00:01:53.880> start<00:01:54.119> off<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.450> traffic
