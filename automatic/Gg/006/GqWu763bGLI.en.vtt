00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.799
 I understood xan but if we start doing 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.650
 the first of the excused land is the 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.300
 question that precisely the fact that the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.950
 line if we start if we don't start a 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.720
 doing is that of the earth precisely that 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.620
 long in the fragment and we do all the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.600
 rest is fine when it came 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.820
 however it must be simple as much 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.830
 boys on the ground and backhoe that since then 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.570
 here I am here at 6 the problem that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.150
 the earth does not serve us the normal earth 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:48.140
 but the quadruple tablets to whom then with 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.090
 the excuse the compressed fault of the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.050
 dub the triple framework previdi centuries 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.899
 in short then 9 do the dub 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.570
 ok another nine of them do the triple 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.710
 and otherwise here after taking 19 from 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:09.409
 49 the fourth ok how much they make me there 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.060
 fourth 6.561 6.561 to those who did not understand 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.679
 we need 6,500 7,000 rounds 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.959
 a thousand pieces of land and who is there 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.179
 he wants to wait a hundred because they were there 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:27.609
 center of that picture and therefore seven 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:27.609
 articles therefore for one hundred and one hundred thousand 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.719
 I did not understand if you are silent, as for 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.429
 land is 600 thousand but the weather problem the 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.490
 problem is how the earth is made 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.319
 here take you the bars or explain time yes 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.049
 take the bars and the English ones there 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.609
 put isab lingotto snon in uniform for 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.609
 last the leaves that because if because 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.679
 because a c.da tree uses pling plus o 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.259
 less maximum two 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.990
 let's do with the leaves a speed one 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.229
 fifteen leaves and every eight sheets is 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.450
 a piece of land reverses the fact 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 the tree on the leaves is not good, however 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.459
 we need trees for help 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.459
 from 15 leaves xander how many trees 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.460
 important we are registered there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.460
 we save we have some sheets 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.780
 expectations we improve the leaves 12 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:34.050
 k 12 kg we already do the 4 million 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:42.300
 sheets for 349 thousand because I did not understand 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:44.730
 wait for the steps of little trees, however, see 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.190
 low I see in the m how many sheets we have 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.190
 and how many trees we have counted mascards 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:02.580
 5 mario 5 mar the chain we're done 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.160
 the mission liquid mobs which we 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.160
 few we record more little so we have 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:21.959
 38 billion lysis of things needed 350 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.690
 thousand trees table 158 I look forward to 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.690
 camilla with an average of 15 tree leaves 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.940
 305 boys of 51,000 in the spectrum 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 experienced aspect aspect guys 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 for the former brand your ass you say they quote 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:43.260
 here another not even a moment gone 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:45.810
 gam then marine 1999 sorry but it is not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.350
 better than nothing raga future because 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.150
 you have a1 and scenes then see you 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.470
 that tomorrow for Germany and tell me 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.690
 I was already registered too and how 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.970
 anything 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.160
 I tried too but if we load it 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.110
 so I'm video like backstage 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.090
 framework there is a before the episode la 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.060
 people will not fall cases told by them 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.040
 thater you also see what like scleri 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.600
 I love the first one every episode I'm there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.950
 I'm not looking for meaning 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.810
 I watch that to grow trees 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.400
 local public even breaks the book then 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.750
 greet everyone that at least ends up like this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.770

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.770
