00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.690
 music of the 20th century in the usa owes you 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.120
 much to the good of james from soul to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.110
 hip hop going through the funk music 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.620
 it sounds good it has good vibrations and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.110
 then it's music so play it like 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.450
 he told you he became the spokesperson

 proud he even traveled to vietnam 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.850
 to support American soldiers 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.110
 all in the middle of the convulses 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 late 60's 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.940
 we have to carry this bread 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.170
 superpower the videos that are there 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.360
 the moment the problem of the life of the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.280
 problem they have tried to kill james 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.020
 Brown wants to go down in history as a 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.970
 man that ended the funk in ay feel 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.250
 good the heirs of james brown gave 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.320
 the approval to the biopic and this sometimes 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.330
 it's a problem because what you usually 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.429
 happen is that they seek to respect good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 name of the deceased and that usually 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.540
 It means that the movie does not get in 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.989
