00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 Hello and welcome to a new video role model 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.359
 this me if i give you a board back apple ipod as 14 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.829
 presented 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.439
 I do not have to be a show element right away, I have a cold but I hope 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.150
 just do not 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.099
 comparable 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.720
 for example the app again 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.210
 in this app 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.210
 So let's get free on the App Store 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.799
 With this app, you can neither call for free and over 

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.070
 Write messages if I'm fine 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.600
 lol the quality 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.620
 if many preliminary talks are not so good but we want to be back as 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.320
 that could show it now 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920
 Percent I have the google translator translation spell 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.640
 he could take over the Wehrmacht and the Weicker translates that for you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.010
 of course, if I say now for example 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 one moment 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 Hello 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.080
 "Then he did not tell me an opera that translates 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 as it works quite well there unfortunately not always but 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.110
 who new Bachelor translator also not important but that's her 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 knows that determines that the Google translator is not so good 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.380
 I recognize Rocker milieu I asked right now that is then let that be 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.130
 Betting browser 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.170
 first zivi-posts but that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.270
 thats why 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.690
 So for the cell phones now commuting fast internet connection has it 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.090
 very advantageous 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 we can now take Hammerstein for example 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
 the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.980
 the Briton 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 in conversation 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 Bern 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.990
 Fuerth 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 critical 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 prompt 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.559
 and throw that is only the softest 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.969
 again by the way 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.559
 it is my website 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:26.959
 So, the percent of advertising that comes out is not you angry 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.459
 Happy Birthday created for free and therefore this advertisement 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.679
 for the 2 0 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.539
 currently it is similar felt the tenth super and funny so important 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.329
 since i have been in shape on this website 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.489
 it was the tenth Android itself 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.739
 Apple itself computer etc so where 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.989
 and I could do it all 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.370
 Here you guys would take other videos and tablets for webmasters 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.459
 if you do not want to describe it on a web page, you need it 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.559
 That's why I want it too 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.089
 so it does not matter if you see the website or relatively fast 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.799
 learned something from there 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.159
 on it I adapted the web browser 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.439
 that the leader of the little one forget about it that's why she can do that 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.129
 Stella 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.339
 We're not letting this skepticism get any darker now 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.209
 he did not buy anything from nine to 13, but I still have that 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.479
 not done 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.799
 Here it looks like celebration 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.679
 this is also a web browser 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.909
 the young woman 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.379
 so that they speak German very nicely from what I say is not a holiday and 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.199
 are common 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.669
 they have the same browser 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.909
 that shows that particular game 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.659
 of the special 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.319
 he can on flash 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.579
 Time what the safari browser can do me 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.489
 So, if you did not think that maybe both 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.329
 Daniela Schreiber soon reports RincÃ³n just be video that is for example 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.589
 not directly a video chat 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.259
 live on a website 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.489
 his country is similar to ads then that too 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.999
 to run 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:15.519
 So maybe children of YouTube, according to Molina Spain advertising 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.780
 and then maybe that is only before the tip 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.369
 Sky celebration browser also signs, by the way, he is also faster than 

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:25.900
 they find out 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 It also manages to hero and Daimler 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.199
 the test is for 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.229
 they are 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.710
 the picture 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.559
 I would have died after the delicious the animals 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.529
 that always wanted to pass by while put 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.599
 before you wanted to 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.550
 if Dr 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.740
 The post on Tel as he looked up did not ask him yet 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.659
 firmly 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.659
 who is pretty nice when everyone comes by 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.470
 7 percent pious 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.740
 I am 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.749
 CZ 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.809
 and 5 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:04.400
 because then you see them set 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.080
 it is not that fast 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.199
 but definitely Stella sometimes is safari 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.259
 So what can I tell you even earlier as a sign of July if he is me now 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.819
 and if not logged in there, he could still write free SMS 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.979
 August again 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.379
 but now comes the big one 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.780
 He could also be more important than ever to have prices present 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.029
 send for free of course 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.930
 since then the 11th 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.729
 he definitely is not like that now 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.770
 That for years, anyone who is fit to be able to video calls 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.809
 were 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:43.449
 Bosses of the facebook app 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.029
 Voters write because the doctors write me bad because the boss is not from cetera 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.339
 Barthel said now 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.219
 it has gotten a little better 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.639
 So the change 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.919
 that we will be there in the end 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.499
 the first Best May was called 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.069
 Velen 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.749
 okay the app does not work Skype anymore 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.249
 but you can quickly, for example 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.249
 if I want to write the younger then 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.910
 so if you and this globe 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.430
 the dried one 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.010
 you can just as many smileys of all times 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.430
 introduce 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.409
 it is very funny 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.589
 Percent and no one else can put in the 1 2 in Israel 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.430
 the work was not vigilant enough 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.430
 to dress up Vivien 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.919
 because you have no questions 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.059
 % Cu take this Gerald I like screaming I try to answer him 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.210
 Desert if you mean 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.529
 Zeitler around a web page 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.339
 Marco also likes to be followed 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.339
 if you sign up in the forum I would be very happy 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:54.930
 who that will be 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.469
 should the value be set to say i'll be back soon new Mar video 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:03.189
 and then I say goodbye but I like the good comments 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.559
 download area if it did not like the video and then until the 

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.139
 first time
