here are a few signs and symptoms that
we'll<00:00:37.090> observe

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we'll observe

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.040 
we'll observe
firstly<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.670> poodle<00:00:40.090> would<00:00:40.239> sway<00:00:40.510> from<00:00:40.570> side

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
firstly the poodle would sway from side

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
firstly the poodle would sway from side
to<00:00:41.079> side<00:00:41.500> while<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:42.010> was<00:00:42.190> standing

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570 

secondly<00:00:46.090> head<00:00:46.840> tremors<00:00:47.290> were<00:00:47.590> observed<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.280> a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
secondly head tremors were observed on a

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.849 
secondly head tremors were observed on a
poodle<00:00:49.030> stationary

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.830 

certainly<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:53.489> poodle<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:53.969> displaying<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
certainly the poodle was displaying this

measure in other words it was walking
very<00:00:58.199> clumsily

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.380 

you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.780 

lastly<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:15.110> Porto<00:01:15.590> had<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.860> very<00:01:16.130> wide<00:01:16.460> base

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
lastly this Porto had a very wide base

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.780 
lastly this Porto had a very wide base
stance<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:18.020> other<00:01:18.200> words<00:01:18.530> its<00:01:19.100> hind<00:01:19.400> legs<00:01:19.490> were

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.070 
very far apart when you were standing
still

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.580 

due<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.400> fact<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.940> all<00:01:29.480> four<00:01:29.930> limbs<00:01:30.200> were

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
due to the fact that all four limbs were

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.430 
due to the fact that all four limbs were
affected<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.940> puto<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.660> diagnosed<00:01:33.200> with

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
affected this puto is diagnosed with

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.300 
affected this puto is diagnosed with
cerebellar<00:01:34.340> ataxia<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.560> because<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
cerebellar ataxia this is because the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.970 
cerebellar ataxia this is because the
cerebellum<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.660> part<00:01:38.900> of<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.170> brain<00:01:39.470> in

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
cerebellum is the part of the brain in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.950 
cerebellum is the part of the brain in
charge<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.460> coordination<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.480> motor

tips and advices firstly diseases of the
nervous<00:02:02.210> system<00:02:02.990> are<00:02:03.200> difficult<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.950> diagnose

nervous system are difficult to diagnose

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.690 
nervous system are difficult to diagnose
it<00:02:05.240> requires<00:02:05.690> MRI<00:02:06.290> scans<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.160> other<00:02:07.340> lab

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
it requires MRI scans and other lab

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.980 
it requires MRI scans and other lab
tests<00:02:09.580> these<00:02:10.580> lab<00:02:10.970> tests<00:02:11.450> will<00:02:11.600> be<00:02:11.750> very

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
tests these lab tests will be very

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.920 
tests these lab tests will be very
expensive<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.890> many<00:02:13.580> orders<00:02:14.090> may<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.690> be

able to afford the left has needed and
therefore<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.680> diagnosis<00:02:19.340> cannot<00:02:19.820> be

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
therefore the diagnosis cannot be

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.400 
therefore the diagnosis cannot be
determined<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:22.730> are<00:02:22.910> also<00:02:23.090> many<00:02:23.660> causes<00:02:24.230> of

determined there are also many causes of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.280 
determined there are also many causes of
