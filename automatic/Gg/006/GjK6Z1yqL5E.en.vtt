00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
car is definitely very cheap however I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
car is definitely very cheap however I
do<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.640> Rockstar<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.300> increase<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
do think that Rockstar will increase the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
do think that Rockstar will increase the
price<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> future<00:00:52.379> simply<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.520> this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
price in the future simply because this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.279 
price in the future simply because this
car<00:00:53.969> shouldn't<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.420> worth<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> amount<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
car shouldn't be worth this amount of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
car shouldn't be worth this amount of
money<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:56.010> instead<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> should<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.640> worth<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
money but instead it should be worth a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
money but instead it should be worth a
lot<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.180> simply<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.530> car<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
lot more simply because this car is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
lot more simply because this car is
possibly<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> best<00:00:59.699> car<00:01:00.000> currently

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
