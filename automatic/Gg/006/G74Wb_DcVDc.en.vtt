shooting<00:01:08.460> gallery<00:01:08.869> but<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.049> sort<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
shooting gallery but it was sort of a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
shooting gallery but it was sort of a
necessity<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.280> sort<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> game<00:01:12.210> more

enjoyable<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> similar<00:01:13.680> experience

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
enjoyable there was a similar experience

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
enjoyable there was a similar experience
we<00:01:14.340> had<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.700> portal<00:01:15.090> where<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> world<00:01:15.869> was

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
we had with portal where the world was

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
we had with portal where the world was
much<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.439> lush<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.920> terms<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> graphic

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
much more lush in terms of graphic

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
much more lush in terms of graphic
design<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.659> play<00:01:18.840> testing<00:01:19.290> showed<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
design but play testing showed that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800 
design but play testing showed that
folks<00:01:20.100> weren't<00:01:20.340> seeing<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.240> critical<00:01:21.630> path

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
folks weren't seeing the critical path

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
folks weren't seeing the critical path
of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> puzzles<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> once<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.310> started

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of the puzzles and once we started

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.740 
of the puzzles and once we started
stripping<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.119> some<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> visual

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
stripping out some of the visual

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
stripping out some of the visual
elements<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.259> were<00:01:25.350> able<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.890> oh<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.369> need

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
elements they were able to see oh I need

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.039 
elements they were able to see oh I need
to<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.869> quit

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to get from here to here and I can quit

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
to get from here to here and I can quit
portals<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.670> similar<00:01:30.090> but

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
portals there so it's in similar but

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
portals there so it's in similar but
different<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.630> play<00:01:30.960> testing<00:01:31.409> showed<00:01:32.009> us<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
different way play testing showed us you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.859 
different way play testing showed us you
know<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> path<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
know the path to that but now that we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:34.969 
know the path to that but now that we
have<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> good<00:01:34.170> framework<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.650> feel<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.829> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
have a good framework we feel that we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
have a good framework we feel that we
can<00:01:35.130> build<00:01:35.250> upon<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> know

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
can build upon that and you know

scripted<00:01:37.560> sequences<00:01:38.040> were<00:01:38.220> never<00:01:38.400> an<00:01:38.549> option

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
scripted sequences were never an option

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.819 
scripted sequences were never an option
because<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.020> were<00:01:40.110> trying<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.560> something

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
because we were trying to have something

that<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.210> procedural<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.329> natural<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that was procedural and natural in

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
that was procedural and natural in
nature<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> dynamic<00:01:44.640> each<00:01:44.759> time<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> played

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it and if you went through and the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
it and if you went through and the
zombie<00:01:47.939> population<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
zombie population was different and the

zombie population was different and the
weapon<00:01:49.649> population<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.610> different<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
weapon population was different then you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.950 
weapon population was different then you
got<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> middle<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> map<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.869> was

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
got to the middle of the map and it was

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
got to the middle of the map and it was
like<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.590> pause<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.250> moment<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like and now we pause for a moment of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.800 
like and now we pause for a moment of
story<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> same

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
story that was going to be the same

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
story that was going to be the same
every<00:01:55.049> time<00:01:55.079> you'd<00:01:55.649> break<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.100> suspension

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
every time you'd break that suspension

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
every time you'd break that suspension
of<00:01:56.700> disbelief<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.360> has<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.780> through<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.080 
allowed us to start building sets and

every facial expression she gives you is

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.379 
every facial expression she gives you is
pretty<00:03:17.620> much<00:03:17.769> handcrafted<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.850> that's<00:03:19.209> just

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
pretty much handcrafted and that's just

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.599 
pretty much handcrafted and that's just
a<00:03:19.510> lot<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.930> hand<00:03:20.139> stitching<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.069> for<00:03:21.280> us<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.519> be

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
a lot of hand stitching so for us to be

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.920 
a lot of hand stitching so for us to be
able<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.850> put<00:03:22.000> out<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.180> mean<00:03:22.359> we<00:03:22.480> tried<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.750> with

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
able to put out I mean we tried it with

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.059 
able to put out I mean we tried it with
episodes<00:03:23.380> we<00:03:23.470> said<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.709> were<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:23.889> to<00:03:23.980> go

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
episodes we said we were going to go

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.500 
episodes we said we were going to go
smaller<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.670> we're<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.180> quicker

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
smaller and we're going to get quicker

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.210 
smaller and we're going to get quicker
we<00:03:26.019> got<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.170> little<00:03:26.410> bit<00:03:26.620> quicker<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:27.100> we

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
we got a little bit quicker but we

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.309 
we got a little bit quicker but we
didn't<00:03:27.639> get<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:28.030> much<00:03:28.239> quicker<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> was

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
didn't get that much quicker and it was

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.500 
didn't get that much quicker and it was
because<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.489> know<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:31.120> hand

more<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.860> know<00:05:01.890> more<00:05:02.370> obvious<00:05:03.180> as<00:05:03.300> we<00:05:03.390> talked

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
more you know more obvious as we talked

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.150 
more you know more obvious as we talked
about<00:05:03.660> like<00:05:03.870> with<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.320> gazebo<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:04.890> some<00:05:05.070> of

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
about like with the gazebo in some of

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.770 
about like with the gazebo in some of
the<00:05:05.220> choke<00:05:05.430> points<00:05:05.790> here<00:05:05.940> in<00:05:05.970> these<00:05:06.150> maps<00:05:06.450> some

the choke points here in these maps some

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.180 
the choke points here in these maps some
of<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.960> reaction<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.470> came<00:05:07.650> was<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> bit<00:05:08.040> of<00:05:08.130> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
of the reaction that came was a bit of a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.090 
of the reaction that came was a bit of a
surprise<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.580> us<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:09.180> mean<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:10.560> know<00:05:10.680> i<00:05:10.919> think

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
surprise to us I mean you know i think

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.140 
surprise to us I mean you know i think
that<00:05:11.430> folks<00:05:11.730> saw<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.510> announcement<00:05:12.780> or<00:05:13.530> they

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
that folks saw the announcement or they

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.430 
that folks saw the announcement or they
interpreted<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.300> announcement<00:05:15.870> as<00:05:16.050> us

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
interpreted the announcement as us

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.950 
interpreted the announcement as us
dropping<00:05:17.430> support<00:05:17.760> for<00:05:18.030> left<00:05:18.180> 4<00:05:18.330> dead<00:05:18.360> one<00:05:18.660> and

dropping support for left 4 dead one and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.320 
dropping support for left 4 dead one and
that's<00:05:19.890> not<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.160> case<00:05:20.490> we<00:05:20.790> have<00:05:21.060> an<00:05:21.210> ongoing

alone we've unveiled the spitter the bug

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.490 
alone we've unveiled the spitter the bug
man<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:42.490> aka<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.240> grenade<00:05:43.540> launcher<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.350> the

man the aka the grenade launcher and the

man the aka the grenade launcher and the
cricket<00:05:44.770> bat<00:05:44.950> when<00:05:45.250> we<00:05:45.310> go<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.460> pax<00:05:45.790> next<00:05:46.360> month

cricket bat when we go to pax next month
or<00:05:46.810> in<00:05:46.840> early<00:05:47.080> September<00:05:47.740> there'll<00:05:48.370> be

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
or in early September there'll be

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.830 
or in early September there'll be
another<00:05:48.700> collection<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.270> new<00:05:49.420> things<00:05:49.450> that

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
another collection of new things that

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.570 
another collection of new things that
will<00:05:49.960> be<00:05:49.990> unveiling<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.800> then<00:05:50.920> you<00:05:51.400> know<00:05:51.550> I

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
will be unveiling and then you know I

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.610 
will be unveiling and then you know I
probably<00:05:52.330> another<00:05:52.690> event<00:05:53.020> before<00:05:53.140> we<00:05:53.410> launch

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
probably another event before we launch

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.440 
probably another event before we launch
so<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:54.190> think<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:56.680> know<00:05:56.800> folks<00:05:57.520> should

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
so I think that you know folks should

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.130 
so I think that you know folks should
sort<00:05:59.260> of<00:05:59.670> take<00:06:00.670> into<00:06:00.880> consideration<00:06:01.660> that<00:06:01.690> you

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
sort of take into consideration that you

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.650 
sort of take into consideration that you
know<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.770> announcement<00:06:03.250> didn't<00:06:03.550> signal<00:06:04.030> the

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
know the announcement didn't signal the

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.810 
know the announcement didn't signal the
end<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:05.320> left<00:06:05.560> 4<00:06:05.680> dead<00:06:05.710> one<00:06:05.980> support<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.640> also

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
end of left 4 dead one support and also

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.760 
end of left 4 dead one support and also
that<00:06:07.150> we<00:06:07.600> haven't<00:06:07.840> finished<00:06:08.110> telling<00:06:08.530> the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
that we haven't finished telling the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.320 
that we haven't finished telling the
story<00:06:09.040> or<00:06:09.160> revealing<00:06:09.580> everything<00:06:09.850> that<00:06:10.180> there

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
story or revealing everything that there

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.270 
story or revealing everything that there
is<00:06:10.360> from<00:06:10.630> left<00:06:10.780> 4<00:06:10.930> dead<00:06:10.960> 2<00:06:11.170> I<00:06:11.530> think<00:06:12.010> the

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
is from left 4 dead 2 I think the

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.100 
is from left 4 dead 2 I think the
announcement<00:06:12.820> of<00:06:12.910> left<00:06:13.090> 4<00:06:13.270> dead<00:06:13.300> 2<00:06:13.540> was

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
announcement of left 4 dead 2 was
