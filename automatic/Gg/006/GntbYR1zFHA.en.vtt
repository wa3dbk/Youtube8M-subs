 I do not want to be ready to talk about 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.820
 Our first floral print theme 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.230
 we love because we want to give moral and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.260
 where does this come from? 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.390
 so much floral there so long I think 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.800
 who went to the ground is historically 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.960
 talking because there's a store in london 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.450
 called bound london investigated and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.850
 freedom that at the end of the 19th century 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.729
 became very famous for the pattern were 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.470
 and are reference worldwide and 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.440
 Friend's word, I think it's good. 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 to explain why on the march because 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.330
 allows you to travel in several hours 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.250
 you can be sexy romantic fight with 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.800
 colors with lace with various types of 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 fabric for example the look yesterday by 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.229
 shirt 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.560
 the floral and absurdly tropical skirt 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:42.130
 abuses is also tropical floral but with 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.270
 most romantic footprint because this look 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 it's cool 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.849
 first has a link that are the leaves 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.130
 the green of the blouse I see in it are in 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.500
 perfect harmony harmony the word 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.899
 You should look at the look and talk. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.090
 beautiful and out if it had not in 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.429
 doubt change something put a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.780
 neutral part to lengthen the silhouette of the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.490
 Camila that we did 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 We chose one more color that would 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.910
 repeats on the two prints in the blue case 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.190
 left his feet out to finish 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.310
 This sensual touch has everything to do with 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.310
 the blow 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.670
 I loved this profit from improving because 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.590
 I have a piece that I love and it's a 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.110
 Super versatile look to mix 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.690
 prints with the sandal makes it a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.510
 look more chic gives an up in the visual but 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.340
 it can be a day look if I put it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.760
 a little dress can be a look and use the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.140
 day in a mall for example the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.000
 My way of wearing floral is 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 completely different from camila and not 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.620
 wears short skirt so the long skirt is 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.140
 way I like to use coral and 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.360
 there the stalin 's trick is the sandal one 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.850
 platform to achieve high 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.320
 elongate the silhouette because they have no height 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.120
 to wear such a long skirt and then I 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.370
 With a tip it's incredible that it was 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.040
 put on a leather jacket and be a 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:08.240
 rocker version of what we call a 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.610
 romantic with rocker and to finish 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.440
 our program put it and me and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.730
 camila with the 2 looks he picked 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.100
 from beginning to end 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.660
 Would you explain to us what you did here? 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.000
 I also decided to make a joke 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 reverse the looks we started 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.709
 so you were more rocker 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.090
 we changed the old choco shirt 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.820
 that we already know that the charter 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.070
 generally have a connection to the 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.080
 foliage placed max put your 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.690
 trend will continue for a long time 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.180
 changes the whole look is this story of the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.610
 Christmas he gives a belt I think 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.760
 This gives a femininity to what has changed 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.760
 all 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.620
 Camila we did not have the other skirt. 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.409
 that we used again is the story of the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.540
 shoe die nude shoe wildcard 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.730
 every woman is long and you can 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.189

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.319
 closed jacket a super buchada 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.000

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.859
 she had already closed left more 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.340
