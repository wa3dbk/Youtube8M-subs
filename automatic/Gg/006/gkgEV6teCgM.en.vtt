yeah it was because I needed to have a

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.309 
yeah it was because I needed to have a
kind<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.849> bigger<00:03:59.090> sound<00:03:59.359> a<00:03:59.599> bit<00:03:59.629> more<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.079> a

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
kind of a bigger sound a bit more of a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.280 
kind of a bigger sound a bit more of a
you<00:04:00.439> know<00:04:00.500> higher<00:04:01.010> output<00:04:01.310> pick<00:04:01.700> up<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.290> I

pickup does it actually go to

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.030
