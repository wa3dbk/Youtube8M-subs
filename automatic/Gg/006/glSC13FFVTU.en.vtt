00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
luckily app will acknowledge this and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
luckily app will acknowledge this and
fix<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.350> beta<00:01:13.500> 4<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> left<00:01:14.549> still

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
fix it in beta 4 so now the left still

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
fix it in beta 4 so now the left still
says<00:01:15.030> contacts<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> SMS<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> right

the right tab is labeled unknown senders

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
the right tab is labeled unknown senders
so<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:21.090> exactly<00:01:21.810> what's<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.110> the
