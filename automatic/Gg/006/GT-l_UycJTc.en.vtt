 authorities, he recalled that only those who 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.150
 playing now when she is good 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.799
 according to his consent then byt 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:09.820
 reward 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.219
 it's just that it's kind of a lie that is not good 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.539
 but there is also the ISB 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.109
 I must say that you can appreciate the eternal 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.439
 his example is not for us with you such a relationship 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.759
 that he is not playing between you and me 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.210
 money does not need her home money 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 if we are left alone in the bank 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.739
 we can play check check 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.910
 this is unethical 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.080
 on-site pe 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400
 because 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.520
 any other player at the table there for example 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 elevator will say 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400
 here's a good number you mean 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.990
 have played 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.980
 this trouble syndrome this goal is ripe 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 movie 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.780
 because they say 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.660
 I have some grass there 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 but if I pay the more 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.000
 coming off then another father probably that 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.090
 everything will work out 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.350
 Petrova will buy a review of over 100 kg 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.690
 rub buy a combination 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.850
 but after I was pushed out 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 choosing a little bit lower but generally 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.990
 talk about what's against me but how 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.280
 it was still quite on the keys what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.430
 it turns out 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 they are very often m 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660
 37 people seem to people at least just 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.730
 less we sell each other 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.710
 and people, but I remember not even right away 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 Qatar query request 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 the prisoner day from 0 2 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 my good 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.430
 buddies among themselves friends they generally 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.550
 they have such an arrangement 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.630
 that since they don't want big money 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.540
 play each other 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.780
 more than 200 500 dollars bank 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.110
 any of them set 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.160
 from another game for hire returns 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.420
 and such a measure 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.549
 Shenderovich territory they are 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.380
 declared type nobody objects to congress 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.840
 besides thought in london please 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.010
 addition is prohibited 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.150
 Your business 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.060
 but people don't want each other 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.150
 precedents 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.110
 in just five minutes 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 happened with such in the case of surrender as 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.830
 one of them makes visits magnifier we 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 together we go this 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.979
 reveals to how this become a couple 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.199
 and I have 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.809
 there is something like a good conversation 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.389
 like a two-way street there is something 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.429
 here you are betting again 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.259
 continuation count 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 and so about some sort of a cp 220 kv 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.810
 and man more than 8,066 billion rubles 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.619
 he plays plus a bank exhibition 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.409
 you understand that the protecting composition 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.389
 new era 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.919
 the site plus the bank will leave of course immediately 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.319
 zholy 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.629
 and it turned out without any 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.299
 preliminary collusion of tempura 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.069
 against me 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.739
 i'm a mountain of it cleverly so nobody came up 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 no objection just no returns 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.999
 all the shorter I objected 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.239
 nobody returns anything to anyone if you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.129
 want to play that plan 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.840
 play this year before suspect 1 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.649
 gram will exchange 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.729
 in tula 4 6 we have become no returns 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.889
 write on paper 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.379
 who has gone to someone but i can't 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.069
 prevented the path of bile management that 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.939
 here they play feels 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.260
 and you understand that from time to time 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.099
 banks 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.999
 pushed out just like tricks of deception 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.899
 that is probably stand if playing 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.059
 even friends and this track is iconic which 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.570
 projects 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.720
 which before the rest 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.310
 components start to perceive 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.140
 Absolutely for sure yes even in its own way 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.149
 I will say that to experience 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.970
 no more than five union 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.339
 we sit at the same table and the relationship is friendly 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.789
 and here all there you do not know that concessions 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.149
 my against each other, we do not even Negro 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.129
 agree just don't attack 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.809
 remote game such a thing 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.239
 that all the time 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.679
 I have a situation here for example in 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.839
 Soviet was several times 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:58.760
 he did 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.559
 Yes, the flop is sometimes with some 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.179
 here someone went to the aviation factory of schools 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.179
 refused tricolor tv 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:09.419
 he 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.719
 there 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.279
 he gave that threw out and sharks 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.909
 after that he plays 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.209
 on black 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.069
 but safe for the net on it was the heart 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.069
 she less I buy straight 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.789
 and although I collected 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.169
 also not a plan so that he said in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.969
 thursday allion so looked me up so 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.819
 ran the war doesn't know maybe 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.460
 doubt opinion 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.499
 not very happy for groups 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.789
 porch review Wednesday 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.580
 but he gave himself to buy a saint 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.500
 I love that we don't have to play between 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.979
 yourself at the table 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.889
 because of such situations in each 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.460
 churches hands 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.669
 someone will 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.969
 someone was a solid fleet and lost 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.219
 criticism 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.059
 then you don't have to play poker 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.569
 because he 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.830
 Well, these grievances are like that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.029
 inevitably 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.259
 because their 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.249
 the more they will be when it was 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.279
 situation that played cap 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.549
 and when the center was situations that started 

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:09.740
 put 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.979
 that I didn't attack my opponent at all 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.629
 this year past from the heights 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.379
 too dangerous the club came to 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.659
 to put 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.659
 that is why 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.010
 none of these 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.190
 seoul crisis arrangement 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.220
 I think it's better 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.340
 in poker do not allow
