00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.889
 all cool with the words themselves bodies others 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.929
 Today we talk about such a fun 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.130
 bullshit like a pomegranate blind smokes but 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.320
 that's what can be more fun than sanctify 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.439
 its its rush itself on its same 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.390
 grenade 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.119
 the most banal became which can 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.960
 happen this when you run from wednesday 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.919
 who left about the doorway never 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.400
 come across all this always yours and 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.559
 it is not clear what comes out of 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.320
 of this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.940
 and of course there are such a super case 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.730
 which you can't do on purpose 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 but here without comments of course 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.990
 no need to get wooden 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.210
 head it at all 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.720
 although he probably after you there probably 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.910
 magnetic tape will be specially worth it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.089
 but also consider the main such 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.790
 funny skipping 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.460
 and of course it often happens that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.520
 have a rest 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 objecting and getting paid zhku over 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 stenochku and all these 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.310
 and of course what they sit there blinks at 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 flash drive she saw her son 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.159
 Of course ricochet off the wall help a lot 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.420
 largely ip 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.950
 cast inna landed on the box this 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.780
 important in principle or what kind of sniper 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.570
 does it stand on the center of the hotel so 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.430
 to whom 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 where could have gone there fell asleep was there and there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.910
 for the terrorist attack then time in this place can 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.840
 stand and flip the proceeds correctly in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 very important 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520
 again the wall helped us in this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.760
 and sales 2 years from report 2 hints on 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.800
 some very funny probros this when 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.030
 closed game decides to leave 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.470
 in this booth 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 two bullets and because of here and quietly 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.399
 fine 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.750

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.810
 last forwarding that time is no longer 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660
