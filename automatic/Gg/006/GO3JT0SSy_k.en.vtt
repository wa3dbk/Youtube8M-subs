never<00:03:08.150> coming<00:03:08.540> off<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:10.370> figured<00:03:10.639> they'd

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
never coming off so I figured they'd

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.080 
never coming off so I figured they'd
give<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.060> shot<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.650> $13<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> gallon<00:03:13.970> at

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
give it a shot it's like $13 a gallon at

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.750 
give it a shot it's like $13 a gallon at
Home<00:03:14.209> Depot<00:03:15.099> it's<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.160> lot<00:03:16.340> cheaper<00:03:16.370> than

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
paying 130 a gallon for undercoat and it

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.509 
paying 130 a gallon for undercoat and it
sure<00:03:21.319> looks<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.919> gonna<00:03:22.010> give<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> same

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
