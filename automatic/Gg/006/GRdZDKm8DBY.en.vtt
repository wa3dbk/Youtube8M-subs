00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
with this here judging by the way this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.990 
with this here judging by the way this
sleeve<00:01:41.850> looks<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:43.610> don't<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> guys

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
sleeve looks I don't know if you guys

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.889 
sleeve looks I don't know if you guys
can<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:47.689> judging<00:01:48.689> by<00:01:48.720> the

way this sleeve looks I think piston and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.590 
way this sleeve looks I think piston and
sleeve<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.799> done<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.700> anyway<00:01:57.540> so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
here if putting it on bottom dead center

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.780 
here if putting it on bottom dead center
won't<00:03:09.970> work<00:03:10.239> for<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:12.069> just<00:03:12.459> kind<00:03:12.609> of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
won't work for you then you just kind of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.349 
won't work for you then you just kind of
you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.359> kind<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.629> move<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.049> around<00:03:14.140> until<00:03:15.359> you

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
you can kind of move it around until you

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.170 
you can kind of move it around until you
find<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:17.530> spot<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.859> where<00:03:18.190> let<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.639> remove<00:03:18.970> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
find a spot to where let you remove it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
find a spot to where let you remove it
go<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> top<00:03:19.989> dead<00:03:20.260> center<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.799> works<00:03:20.980> better

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
go to top dead center that works better

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.069 
go to top dead center that works better
okay<00:03:23.940> now<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.959> just<00:03:26.459> kind<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.609> just<00:03:28.120> move<00:03:28.959> it

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
okay now you just kind of just move it

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.690 
okay now you just kind of just move it
around<00:03:29.169> and<00:03:29.620> wiggle<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:29.950> around<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.579> there

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
around and wiggle it around and there

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.770 
around and wiggle it around and there
until<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:32.019> pops<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.790> piston<00:03:33.790> piston<00:03:34.450> and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
until it pops out piston piston and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.440 
until it pops out piston piston and
connecting<00:03:35.230> you're<00:03:35.349> out<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.470> pop<00:03:35.769> oh<00:03:39.450> just

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
connecting you're out of pop oh just

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.720 
connecting you're out of pop oh just
like<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.400> there<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:44.280> let's<00:03:45.280> see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
like so and there it is and let's see

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.520 
like so and there it is and let's see
here<00:03:48.540> yeah<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:50.079> piston<00:03:50.919> looks<00:03:51.250> like<00:03:51.489> it's

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
here yeah the piston looks like it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.880 
here yeah the piston looks like it's
trying<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.680> wipe<00:03:53.859> all<00:03:54.129> this<00:03:54.760> off<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.239> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.500 

yeah<00:04:00.470> some<00:04:01.470> pretty<00:04:01.740> good<00:04:01.950> scoring<00:04:02.520> on<00:04:02.940> there<00:04:03.240> I

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
yeah some pretty good scoring on there I

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.449 
yeah some pretty good scoring on there I
don't<00:04:03.990> know<00:04:04.080> if<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.290> guys<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.400> if

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
don't know if you guys I don't know if

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.309 
don't know if you guys I don't know if
the<00:04:05.550> camera<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:06.150> able<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.450> pick<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.930> or<00:04:07.170> not

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
the camera be able to pick it up or not

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.800 
the camera be able to pick it up or not
but<00:04:07.709> there's<00:04:08.100> some<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.610> bad<00:04:08.940> scoring<00:04:09.630> in

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
but there's some really bad scoring in

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.240 
but there's some really bad scoring in
there<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.750> piston<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.290> sleeve<00:04:13.680> or<00:04:13.980> shot

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
there so the piston and sleeve or shot

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.860 
there so the piston and sleeve or shot
on<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:15.049> then<00:04:16.049> moving<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.269> see<00:04:18.269> now<00:04:18.829> got<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
on that then moving on see now got the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.490 
on that then moving on see now got the
piston<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:21.989> sleeve<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.100> there<00:04:24.500> now

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
piston and sleeve is out of there now

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.850 
piston and sleeve is out of there now
what<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.919> do<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:27.570> want<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.840> take<00:04:28.080> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
what you do is you want to take the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.710 
what you do is you want to take the
crankshaft<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:31.970> sometimes<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.480> have

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
crankshaft of it and sometimes we have

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.650 
crankshaft of it and sometimes we have
to<00:04:33.780> do<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.230> sometimes<00:04:34.680> they<00:04:34.919> may<00:04:35.130> be<00:04:35.190> stuck<00:04:35.669> so

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
to do is sometimes they may be stuck so

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.750 
to do is sometimes they may be stuck so
you<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:37.380> take<00:04:37.590> pretty<00:04:37.980> much<00:04:38.070> any<00:04:38.430> tool

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
you can just take pretty much any tool

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.360 
you can just take pretty much any tool
and<00:04:39.480> just<00:04:39.510> give<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.960> little<00:04:40.080> tap<00:04:41.690> like<00:04:42.690> that

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and just give it a little tap like that

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.040 
and just give it a little tap like that
you<00:04:44.370> know<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.210> here<00:04:45.419> wasn't<00:04:45.690> stuck<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.980> I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
you know this one here wasn't stuck so I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.330 
you know this one here wasn't stuck so I
didn't<00:04:49.050> need<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.260> do<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.410> but<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:49.950> was<00:04:50.130> just

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
didn't need to do that but I was just

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.050 
didn't need to do that but I was just
showing<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:52.440> then<00:04:52.470> if<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.580> doesn't<00:04:53.730> want<00:04:54.150> to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
showing and then if it doesn't want to

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.650 
showing and then if it doesn't want to
come<00:04:57.060> out<00:04:57.120> all<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.750> way<00:04:59.120> just<00:05:00.120> give<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.480> few

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
come out all the way just give it a few

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.200 
come out all the way just give it a few
taps<00:05:02.180> there<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.300> go<00:05:05.090> there's<00:05:06.090> your

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
taps there you go there's your

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.659 
taps there you go there's your
connecting<00:05:07.200> rod<00:05:07.470> earlier<00:05:08.479> crankshaft<00:05:09.479> and

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
connecting rod earlier crankshaft and

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.270 
connecting rod earlier crankshaft and
the<00:05:11.669> crane<00:05:12.570> shaft<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.229> showing<00:05:13.710> a<00:05:13.860> little<00:05:14.040> bit

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
the crane shaft is showing a little bit

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.700 
the crane shaft is showing a little bit
of<00:05:14.520> rust<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:17.600> but<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.810> can<00:05:19.020> clean<00:05:19.410> that<00:05:19.440> up

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
of rust so but I can clean that up

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.370 
of rust so but I can clean that up
that's<00:05:20.190> no<00:05:20.370> big<00:05:20.550> deal<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:24.380> there's<00:05:25.380> your<00:05:25.560> case

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
that's no big deal and there's your case

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.710 
that's no big deal and there's your case
everything<00:05:28.380> is<00:05:28.890> everything<00:05:29.880> is<00:05:30.150> out<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.419> it

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
everything is everything is out of it

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.040 
everything is everything is out of it
and<00:05:31.410> then<00:05:31.590> what<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:31.890> want<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.220> do<00:05:32.430> is<00:05:33.320> use<00:05:34.320> some

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
and then what you want to do is use some

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.580 
and then what you want to do is use some
well<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.260> could<00:05:37.440> use<00:05:38.030> wd-40<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:40.260> could<00:05:40.440> use

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
well you could use wd-40 you could use

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.200
