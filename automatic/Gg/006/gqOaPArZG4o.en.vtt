00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
doing it on this side I'm just making a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.340 
doing it on this side I'm just making a
little<00:02:12.470> tick<00:02:12.800> at<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.220> three<00:02:13.430> inch

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350

little tick at the three inch
another<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.430> tick<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.720> lining

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
another little tick and then lining

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.690 
another little tick and then lining
those<00:02:17.260> two<00:02:17.560> up<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:20.250> scoring<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:21.520> my

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
ballpoint pen I actually pushed so hard

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.420 
ballpoint pen I actually pushed so hard
that<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.510> broke<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.380> but<00:02:26.620> that's<00:02:26.830> okay<00:02:27.070> that's

the<00:02:30.310> lines<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.880> can't<00:02:31.210> see<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> ink<00:02:31.810> but

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
the lines and you can't see the ink but

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.140 
the lines and you can't see the ink but
I<00:02:32.080> can<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.470> where<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> scored<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.850> now<00:02:34.030> I'm

going to take my scissors and I'm going
to<00:02:36.910> start<00:02:37.150> cutting<00:02:37.330> from<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.810> end<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to start cutting from the end up to the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.800 
to start cutting from the end up to the
score<00:02:40.320> up<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.590> where<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.830> two<00:02:42.010> lines<00:02:42.700> meet<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
score up to where the two lines meet and

you're going to do every other section
so<00:02:46.090> I'm<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.780> cut<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.200> inside<00:02:47.590> of

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.620 
so I'm going to if I cut the inside of
this<00:02:47.890> section<00:02:48.130> I'm<00:02:48.550> not<00:02:49.090> going<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.360> cut<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.960 
this section I'm not going to cut the
other<00:02:49.810> inside<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:50.560> gonna<00:02:50.740> turn<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.490> cut

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
other inside I'm gonna turn it and cut

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.690 
other inside I'm gonna turn it and cut
it<00:02:52.000> over<00:02:52.330> here<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:53.650> when<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.100> fold<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.580> we

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
it over here because when we fold it we

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970 
it over here because when we fold it we
need<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> flap<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.480> glue<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.470> since<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.770> cut

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
need a flap to glue it in so since I cut

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.040 
need a flap to glue it in so since I cut
this<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.400> don't<00:02:57.640> cut<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.390> turn<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.900> cut

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050

over<00:02:59.290> here<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.390> again<00:03:02.020> turn<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.070> cut<00:03:03.250> over

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
over here and again turn and cut over

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.220 
over here and again turn and cut over
here<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:04.210> when<00:03:04.390> you're<00:03:04.510> looking<00:03:04.810> make<00:03:05.020> sure

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
that the other ones not cut you want

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
that the other ones not cut you want
every<00:03:07.840> other<00:03:07.990> piece<00:03:08.470> okay<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.470> okay

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
every other piece okay like that okay

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.670 
every other piece okay like that okay
and<00:03:12.490> then<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.210> lines<00:03:13.450> you've<00:03:13.780> you've<00:03:14.140> grooved

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
and then the lines you've you've grooved

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
and then the lines you've you've grooved
them<00:03:15.040> pretty<00:03:15.490> well<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.790> your<00:03:15.910> ballpoint<00:03:16.300> pen

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
them pretty well with your ballpoint pen

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.510 
them pretty well with your ballpoint pen
so<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.440> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.710> kind<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.040> hold<00:03:18.280> it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
so you're just going to kind of hold it

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.890 
so you're just going to kind of hold it
and<00:03:18.730> if<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> helps<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.300> hold<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.660> ruler

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and if it helps you to hold the ruler

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.350 
and if it helps you to hold the ruler
against<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.410> line<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:21.340> fold<00:03:21.580> up<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.030> score

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
against that line to fold up the score

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.600 
against that line to fold up the score
you're<00:03:22.540> going<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.900> fold<00:03:23.380> up<00:03:23.770> each<00:03:26.610> line

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
you're going to just fold up each line

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.380 
you're going to just fold up each line
that<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.910> scored<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.930> whole<00:03:32.140> thing<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:33.390> then

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
that you scored the whole thing and then

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.090 
that you scored the whole thing and then
with<00:03:34.600> your<00:03:34.750> hot<00:03:34.990> glue<00:03:35.170> you're<00:03:35.560> going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.860> glue

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
with your hot glue you're going to glue

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.690 
with your hot glue you're going to glue
each<00:03:36.370> flap<00:03:37.440> down<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.770> this<00:03:38.920> short<00:03:39.130> flap<00:03:39.430> gets

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
each flap down so this short flap gets

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.060 
each flap down so this short flap gets
tucked<00:03:39.970> under<00:03:40.330> hot<00:03:40.930> glue<00:03:41.170> goes<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:41.950> then

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
tucked under hot glue goes here and then

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:50.040 
tucked under hot glue goes here and then
we're<00:03:42.160> gonna<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.790> way<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:49.840> put

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
we're gonna do it this way so I just put

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.180 
we're gonna do it this way so I just put
a<00:03:50.080> good<00:03:50.350> little<00:03:50.560> drizzle<00:03:52.320> fold<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.470> over<00:03:53.590> line

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
a good little drizzle fold it over line

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.910 
a good little drizzle fold it over line
up<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.550> edges<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.360> hold<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:58.290> okay<00:03:59.290> find<00:03:59.740> your

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
up the edges and hold it okay find your

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.110 
up the edges and hold it okay find your
next<00:04:00.100> flat<00:04:00.520> make<00:04:00.790> sure<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.120> tucked<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:03.120> put

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
next flat make sure it's tucked in put

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.060 
next flat make sure it's tucked in put
some<00:04:04.330> glue<00:04:04.570> mainly<00:04:05.290> on<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.530> edges<00:04:05.890> that's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
some glue mainly on the edges that's

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.180 
some glue mainly on the edges that's
what<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.460> want<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.730> hold<00:04:07.170> line<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> up<00:04:08.470> hold<00:04:09.040> it

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
what you want to hold line it up hold it

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.500 
what you want to hold line it up hold it
down<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.930> glue<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:12.670> size<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.090> box<00:04:13.300> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
down and glue and the size of the box is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.690 
down and glue and the size of the box is
going<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.750> depend<00:04:13.990> on<00:04:14.230> maybe<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.190> image<00:04:15.490> that

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
going to depend on maybe the image that

animals and things all around the edge

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.980 
animals and things all around the edge
okay<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.699> since<00:04:45.969> I<00:04:46.090> measured<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:46.539> at<00:04:46.749> three

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
okay so since I measured this at three

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.050 
okay so since I measured this at three
inches<00:04:47.409> I'm<00:04:47.710> gonna<00:04:48.189> want<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.490> make<00:04:48.639> sure<00:04:48.669> that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
inches I'm gonna want to make sure that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.939 
inches I'm gonna want to make sure that
when<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.240> do<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.659> bottom<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.469> it's<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.710> little

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
when I do the bottom that it's a little

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.129 
when I do the bottom that it's a little
bit<00:04:51.069> smaller<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.819> it<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.210> lid<00:04:52.599> can<00:04:52.840> nest

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
bit smaller so that it the lid can nest

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.950 
bit smaller so that it the lid can nest
over<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.529> top<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.580> I'm<00:04:54.819> going<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.180> measure<00:04:55.599> at

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
over the top so I'm going to measure at

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.649 
over the top so I'm going to measure at
three<00:04:58.050> three<00:04:59.050> inches<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.919> then<00:05:00.729> two<00:05:01.180> little

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
three three inches and then two little

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.119 
three three inches and then two little
lines<00:05:01.860> what<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.219> millimeters<00:05:05.129> however

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
lines what is that millimeters however

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.580 
lines what is that millimeters however
that<00:05:06.520> works<00:05:06.759> so<00:05:07.509> three<00:05:07.750> inches<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:08.379> two

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
that works so three inches and two

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.559 
that works so three inches and two
little<00:05:08.740> lines<00:05:09.009> because<00:05:09.430> if<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.699> don't<00:05:09.909> your

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
little lines because if you don't your

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.600 
little lines because if you don't your
lid<00:05:10.779> will<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.199> fit<00:05:11.529> so<00:05:12.250> I'm<00:05:12.340> going<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.520> go

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
lid will not fit so I'm going to go

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.550 
lid will not fit so I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:12.669> and<00:05:12.879> do<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.090> same<00:05:13.270> thing<00:05:15.060> all<00:05:16.060> around

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.999 

match<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.830> up<00:05:22.199> score<00:05:23.199> it<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.529> make<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.860> line

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
match it up score it and make the line

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.010 
match it up score it and make the line
at<00:05:24.159> the<00:05:24.279> same<00:05:24.490> time<00:05:24.789> I'm<00:05:25.389> gonna<00:05:25.599> go<00:05:25.719> ahead<00:05:25.900> and
