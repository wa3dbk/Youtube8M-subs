 I have you want things for that and me 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.470

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.110
 for the lava we basically only have 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.060

 And then we can do the type we need 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.050
 not even to bring lava because we 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
 to a very able but still does 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.670
 this is a lake but when shook itself 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560

 I want to go to your worst palm islands 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.500
 show and so I'm not sure 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.060
 can go through this 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 but I think so but we are going now 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.260
 of course see and i got in that cunt 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.730
 someone is building here i know 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.500
 not who this jewelry builders men but 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.280
 with it also out there will be it 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 private beach house or something no here 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.120
 I don't think we can get through it anymore 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.440
 people i'm going to walk for a while after the sea 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.030
 then I'll see you back soon 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.369
 people here are the palm island i am 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 has gone a bit away from mine 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.370
 yes at my own island and like you 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.440
 maybe these are the palm trees holy 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.989
 shit I'm pretty sick things 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.150
 if i do it myself and every island has such 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.310
 palm trees to name it and so on 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.209
 I find you I find a fat here clits 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 little in the water 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.400
 that come crash him and put him down 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.260
 so you just suddenly have to block 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.209
 and according to michael's it is then 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.130
 on land but yes it does look there 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.680
 a little weird 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.810
 but yes personal thickness of palm islands 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.190
 very tenis there are that place 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 jungle can get well 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.570
 the jungle set left but jungle 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.970
 sampling you get very tall trees 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.770
 so yes maybe they find that handy and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.570
 now we just have to be the one i stay 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.040
 and arrived at the volcano from so 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.470
 people like us at the volcano then 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.630
 see you again and I think 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.760
 one day we are at the volcano ladies and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.110
 gentlemen yes this is too often 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.450
 ladies and gentlemen boys and girls line 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 I arrived at the people on the island 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.140
 don't know then would like other team 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 been going it would in the admissions 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.940
 from thomas for example and i don't know 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.130
 or should another team also go 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.100
 I know go there now a very 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.250
 broken through a forest is becoming and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.930
 be a bit of a walk 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.460
 so yes i have them watching it there 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.780
 behind is in any case the for k that 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.130
 I know because I have this folder myself 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.330
 made that works of course one 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.980
 advantage for me then I am one again 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.690
 a bit further well but michael spots 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 a bit so I have to reset it for a while 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.040
 but as you see now I think yes 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.050
 slowly the stone starts here 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.610
 fork to arrive 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.890
 yes the vocal ie 'office starts with best 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.050
 well style so maybe yes we have 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 building blocks outer fabric handy here 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.070
 look so ladies and gentlemen we leave it 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.410
 forest of the people on island and we go 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.480
 now start the huge climb of the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.190
 volcano and I am very curious if there is already 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.480
 very much drawer or troll very 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.160
 much chance in the way is that opportunity 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.570
 of course quite large and it will 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.550
 maybe someday it will come 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.710
 option that is just here then I have to 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.610
 just make a new drawer or well 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.860
 let's see 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.570
 it is already getting a bit harder 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.530
 to get you up so it will be 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.180
 little time here a little bit 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.220
 break blocks 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.230
 I'm going to go up larvae soon 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.600
 fancy chopping that I am not going 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.010
 Do look and allow yourself to be in the mood 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.840
 block very nice then go for this 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.130
 the dichotomy john ladies down and then 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 let's do the third right here too 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.520
 very nice and yes I am very 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.160
 curious how many people actually already 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.960
 la clearly chopped or caught actually 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.510
 I don't think so much I think especially 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.920
 In Sardinia, well, we just want him to be a goal 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.440
 for people to out corn to the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.150
 Go nether and you have infinite lava 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.950
 you do not have infinite psi things 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.480
 if you don't get lava you ca n't 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.730
 place in the nether 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.950
 yes that is just a fun fact that 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.680
 is just like that so I did n't ask either 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.080
 and also when you place your bed in the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.190
 then explodes on bed cone in my opinion 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.780
 the ant too 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.240
 so you can do that and the calculated whole 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.889
 easy to explode they have too 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.169
 Just by and bed him down to 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.139
 put if comes well have five option 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.460
 which you so that is reasonable nose and 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.289
 do not economize on the top of the volcano 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.600
 and yes this is of course the only one ever 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.949
 places in the whole folder my option can 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.539
 so they get pretty important 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.789
 that we just here a decent 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.590
 number on heels we have up to 12 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.630
 necessary and then we can ultimately 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.280
 to enchante if powders already have 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.780
 fridge I am not sure now but we 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.770
 level is super for cows it 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.360
 A lot 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.490
 sugar cane so that is basically none 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.139
 problem so we have as we want 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.509
 there just super many books so that 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.669
 It doesn't matter and we need one 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.160
 on senior and after that I never high up 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.780
 on the corner to take a look together 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.340
 was almost over as you see 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.380
 can already see the glow of the late 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.389
 if you are already here 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.009
 yes just look so very beautiful 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.229
 the room from upstairs is looking well 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.509
 12 on sentences the city is super handy and 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.680
 each other's corners above look at how 3 is one 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.870
 bit looks 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.280

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.710
 all option you or we all 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.289

 watch it is not 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.260
 in flickr it would be a bit awkward 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.580
