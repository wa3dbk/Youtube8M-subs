 day as a real racing driver 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 are two options the first is the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.069
 Mitsubishi fan day where owners 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.380
 SUVs like this and xis 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.719

 sportback can participate in a race 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.670
 regularity in autumn is the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.560
 opportunity to feel the adrenaline of 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.560
 to drive the cars on a day to day basis 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.359
 environment and control but in this 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.380
 case as it is a proof of 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.929
 regularity 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.819
 the objective is not to accelerate, but 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.159
 to pass the time set by 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.379
 pre-determined stretches along the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.360
 such circuit is the day-to-day power for 

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.429
 a track with total security for those who 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.340
 I like speed, I would go there and get the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.659
 road on a street but at risk others 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.819
 other people 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.229
 knows those total security in one 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:07.420
 Phenomenal asphalt is net girl in this know 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.959
 that you have a car that you use all over 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.359
 day you can have more fun with it 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.480
 is very cost effective on the track. 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.970
 cool, this fun more in the car 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 expectation is enormous the first time 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.349
 I'm coming here for adrenaline 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.359
 It is certainly the first time that 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.310
 we will see his performance in a 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.310
 track suitable for him right 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.810
 and in this climate 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.880
 there are people who even took advantage of the scenery 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 to save a special memory 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 Are you going to do a wedding back? 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.930
 we have many many cars and it's a 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.440
 unusual idea a thing different from 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.440
 if done 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.850
 the other option is for those who seek a little 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.890
 more emotion especially who is 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.870
 owner of a lancer evolution model and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.840
 want to accelerate strong in an environment 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.450
 safe and absolutely professional to 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.310
 this mitsubishi created lancer evo day 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.320
 recommendations for those who are 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.920
 new track is to take great care with 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.680
 brake heating always walking 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.870
 within its limit not the limit of the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.310
 car because that makes a difference 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.030
 huge 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.650
 After you're done, you're going to graduate. 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.840
 take the limit of the car but 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.640
 this is still at its limit so that 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.140
 spoil the car and avoid an accident 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.100
 beast right? 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 all part of track flag prosecutor 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.500

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.600

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.970
 already on the track the drivers take the wheel 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.940
 of their cars and participate in three 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.760
 45-minute batteries where 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 can exploit the full performance of 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 lancer evolution I think to have 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.100
 a mistake that has to bring to track and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 only mitsubishi that allowed 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.420
