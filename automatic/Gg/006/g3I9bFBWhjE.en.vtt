things that we carry with us when
traveling<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> backcountry<00:00:29.760> there's<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
traveling in the backcountry there's a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990 
traveling in the backcountry there's a
minimum<00:00:31.289> amount<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.890> gear<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.790> should

in avalanche terrain first thing you'd
want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> an<00:00:39.149> avalanche

beacon<00:00:40.290> we've<00:00:40.800> used<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> BCA<00:00:41.969> tracker<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
beacon we've used this BCA tracker and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.920 
beacon we've used this BCA tracker and
the<00:00:43.260> BCA<00:00:43.770> tracker<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the BCA tracker to that this one is and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.779 
the BCA tracker to that this one is and
they've<00:00:46.110> worked<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.340> us<00:00:47.520> they're

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
they've worked very good for us they're

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.439 
they've worked very good for us they're
very<00:00:47.820> simple<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.700> they're<00:00:50.700> easy<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
very simple to use and they're easy to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
very simple to use and they're easy to
learn<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:53.070> key<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.640> though<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
learn the key to this though is to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.549 
learn the key to this though is to
practice<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
practice with it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
practice with it
so<00:00:55.920> anybody<00:00:56.219> travel<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> backcountry

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so anybody travel in the backcountry

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.319 
so anybody travel in the backcountry
should<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.910> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
should have one of these with them with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.840 
should have one of these with them with
the<00:01:00.510> knowledge<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.140> use<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.620> another<00:01:02.520> thing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the knowledge to use it another thing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
the knowledge to use it another thing
that<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> should<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that you should have with you is a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.450 
that you should have with you is a
shovel<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:07.049> probe<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.799> unique<00:01:08.130> thing

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
shovel and a probe the unique thing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
shovel and a probe the unique thing
about<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.030> shovel<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.290> converted

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
about this shovel is it can be converted

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.179 
about this shovel is it can be converted
into<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.369> whole<00:01:11.700> mode<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.200> repin<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
into a whole mode or you can repin it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.330 
into a whole mode or you can repin it
and<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.820> works<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> shovel<00:01:16.040> another<00:01:17.040> thing

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and it works as a shovel another thing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.260 
and it works as a shovel another thing
that<00:01:17.520> we've<00:01:17.670> been<00:01:17.700> carrying<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.170> BCA

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
that we've been carrying is this BCA

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
that we've been carrying is this BCA
float<00:01:21.350> 22<00:01:22.350> throttle<00:01:23.250> series<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.840> reason<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
float 22 throttle series the reason that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
float 22 throttle series the reason that
we've<00:01:26.310> chose<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.360> bag<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.290> like

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
we've chose this bag and what we like

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.359 
we've chose this bag and what we like
about<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.240> feature<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.770> things<00:01:32.100> it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
about this is the feature to things it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.230 
about this is the feature to things it's
designed<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.170> snowmobile<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.729> because<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
designed for snowmobile use because the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.030 
designed for snowmobile use because the
plunger<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.229> activation<00:01:37.979> plunger<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:40.040> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
plunger the activation plunger is on the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.690 
plunger the activation plunger is on the
right<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> therefore<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.350> maintain<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
right so therefore you can maintain your

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
right so therefore you can maintain your
hand<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> throttle<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.590> reach<00:01:46.829> over

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
hand on the throttle you can reach over

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420 
hand on the throttle you can reach over
and<00:01:47.520> activate<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.689> airbag<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.500> necessary

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and activate the airbag if necessary

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.200 
and activate the airbag if necessary
another<00:01:51.360> reason<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.579> that<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.970> about

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
another reason that we that I like about

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.219 
another reason that we that I like about
this<00:01:54.689> BCA<00:01:55.500> bag<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.810> stuff

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this BCA bag is that all of this stuff

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.840 
this BCA bag is that all of this stuff
the<00:01:59.130> probe<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.110> shovel<00:02:01.110> has<00:02:02.100> its<00:02:02.640> own

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the probe the shovel has its own

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.170 
the probe the shovel has its own
compartments<00:02:03.780> inside<00:02:04.619> other<00:02:05.460> things<00:02:05.969> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
compartments inside other things that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.119 
compartments inside other things that
we've<00:02:06.299> carried<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:06.990> us<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.619> we're<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:07.979> in

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
we've carried with us when we're out in

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.740 
we've carried with us when we're out in
the<00:02:08.220> backcountry<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:11.060> fire<00:02:12.060> starters

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the backcountry are these fire starters

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.070 
the backcountry are these fire starters
personally<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> view

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
personally what I view

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.050 
personally what I view
is<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:15.070> it's<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:16.150> waterproof<00:02:16.950> matches<00:02:18.060> when

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
is this it's a waterproof matches when
