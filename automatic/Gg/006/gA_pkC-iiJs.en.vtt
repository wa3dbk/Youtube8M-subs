then<00:00:02.310> you'll<00:00:02.490> see<00:00:02.669> what<00:00:02.790> that's<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.270> a

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
then you'll see what that's for in a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.369 
then you'll see what that's for in a
little<00:00:03.510> bit<00:00:04.400> and<00:00:05.400> again<00:00:05.790> let's<00:00:06.629> back<00:00:06.810> out<00:00:07.049> go

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
little bit and again let's back out go

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.100 
little bit and again let's back out go
into<00:00:08.570> normal<00:00:09.570> mode<00:00:10.190> turn<00:00:11.190> gravity<00:00:11.670> back<00:00:11.880> on

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
into normal mode turn gravity back on

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:25.460 
into normal mode turn gravity back on
and<00:00:13.110> hit<00:00:13.920> simulate<00:00:14.160> local

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.130 

now<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> skirts<00:00:26.789> awfully<00:00:27.090> high<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
now the skirts awfully high up here so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.339 
now the skirts awfully high up here so
what<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> probably<00:00:29.099> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.609> go<00:00:29.759> into

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
what I probably want to do is go into

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
what I probably want to do is go into
groups<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> object<00:00:31.859> mode<00:00:32.189> select<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> waist

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
groups of object mode select the waist

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.049 
groups of object mode select the waist
verts<00:00:33.770> I'm<00:00:34.770> i<00:00:34.829> turn<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> constraint<00:00:35.579> off<00:00:35.760> for

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
verts I'm i turn the constraint off for

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.869 
verts I'm i turn the constraint off for
a<00:00:36.090> second<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.199> out<00:00:37.519> simulate<00:00:38.519> local

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a second and go back out simulate local

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.369 
a second and go back out simulate local
and<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.329> there's<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.780> dress<00:00:40.230> should

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and now there's this dress should

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:51.800 
and now there's this dress should
actually<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> slide<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> little<00:00:41.760> bit

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.570 

and<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.830> through<00:00:53.070> its<00:00:53.370> process

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
and it's going to go through its process

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.950 
and it's going to go through its process
i'm<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.240> ahead<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.450> stop<00:00:54.810> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
i'm going to go ahead and stop this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.270 
i'm going to go ahead and stop this
because<00:00:55.200> it<00:00:55.260> may<00:00:55.410> take<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
because it may take a little bit for it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
because it may take a little bit for it
to<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.580> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.150> settle<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to actually kind of settle into the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.360 
to actually kind of settle into the
place<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:58.740> want<00:00:59.010> it<00:01:00.020> okay<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.160> its

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
place that I want it okay so now its

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.970 
place that I want it okay so now its
kind<00:01:02.580> of<00:01:02.640> falling<00:01:03.270> down<00:01:03.630> a<00:01:03.660> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
kind of falling down a little bit and so

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.690 
kind of falling down a little bit and so
I<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.610> groups<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> object<00:01:06.330> mode

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
I can go back into groups of object mode

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.950 
I can go back into groups of object mode
select<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> waistline<00:01:09.150> verts<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:09.810> I'm

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
select the waistline verts and now I'm

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.250 
select the waistline verts and now I'm
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> turn<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.290> constraint<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
going to turn that constraint back on

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:27.649 
going to turn that constraint back on
and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> simulate<00:01:13.920> local<00:01:14.370> again

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 

and<00:01:27.929> of<00:01:28.619> course<00:01:28.679> it<00:01:29.159> moved<00:01:29.490> everything<00:01:29.819> back

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and of course it moved everything back

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.059 
and of course it moved everything back
up<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> selected<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.710> verts

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
up because when I selected those verts

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.980 
up because when I selected those verts
they<00:01:33.030> were<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.359> much<00:01:33.659> higher<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.780> case

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they were up much higher so in this case

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
they were up much higher so in this case
what<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.399> actually<00:01:38.520> going

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
what I want to do is I'm actually going

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.059 
what I want to do is I'm actually going
to<00:01:38.819> delete<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:41.719> constraint<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
to delete that constraint I'm going to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.919 
to delete that constraint I'm going to
delete<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.420> rerun<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
delete it and I'm going to rerun that

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.690 
delete it and I'm going to rerun that
simulation<00:01:46.350> let<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.709> fall<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:46.950> again<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.609> I'm

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
simulation let it fall down again so I'm

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
simulation let it fall down again so I'm
going<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:47.880> stop<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.119> again<00:01:48.599> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going to stop this again so I can get it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.789 
going to stop this again so I can get it
back<00:01:49.859> into<00:01:50.069> pool<00:01:51.200> okay<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:57.679> now<00:01:58.679> we've

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
back into pool okay so let's now we've

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.199 
back into pool okay so let's now we've
got<00:01:58.979> those<00:01:59.189> verts<00:01:59.549> selected<00:02:01.969> let's<00:02:02.969> go<00:02:03.060> ahead

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
got those verts selected let's go ahead

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.350 
got those verts selected let's go ahead
and<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> group<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.319> we'll<00:02:04.619> call<00:02:04.829> them

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
and make a group and we'll call them

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.960 
and make a group and we'll call them
waste<00:02:06.799> non<00:02:07.799> bias<00:02:09.410> okay<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.709> now<00:02:11.700> we're<00:02:11.879> going

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
waste non bias okay and now we're going

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.339 
waste non bias okay and now we're going
to<00:02:12.030> preserve<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> surface<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
to preserve it to the surface so that it

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.680 
to preserve it to the surface so that it
maintains<00:02:13.650> where<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.299> where<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
maintains where it is now not where it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.740 
maintains where it is now not where it
was<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.950> mistake<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.519> made

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
was that was the mistake that I made

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.849 
was that was the mistake that I made
it's<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> good<00:02:19.019> wooden<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.319> remember<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:21.859> again

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
it's a good wooden to remember and again

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.710 
it's a good wooden to remember and again
we're<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.400> point<00:02:23.730> nine<00:02:25.190> point<00:02:26.190> nine

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
we're going to do point nine point nine

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.380 
we're going to do point nine point nine
and<00:02:27.720> I'll<00:02:27.840> tell<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.319> use<00:02:28.500> these<00:02:28.680> properties

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
and I'll tell it to use these properties

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.030 
and I'll tell it to use these properties
so<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> knows<00:02:30.660> where<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> fix<00:02:31.319> these<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.799> again

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so it knows where to fix these and again

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.170 
so it knows where to fix these and again
if<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.310> hit<00:02:32.459> simulate<00:02:32.670> local

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.369 

looks<00:02:39.049> like<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.260> may<00:02:39.409> have<00:02:39.469> forgotten<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:39.980> verte

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.580 

like<00:02:45.379> there<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> single<00:02:46.099> vert<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:48.230> with

like there is a single vert not with

like there is a single vert not with

wow<00:02:59.510> that's<00:03:00.510> new<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.900> different<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.350> there

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
wow that's new and different right there

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
wow that's new and different right there
so<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.190> I've<00:03:02.310> got<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> verte<00:03:02.820> passing

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
so I now I've got a verte passing

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.320 
so I now I've got a verte passing
through<00:03:03.840> or<00:03:04.020> trying<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.350> connect<00:03:04.650> itself<00:03:04.950> to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
through or trying to connect itself to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.030 
through or trying to connect itself to
this<00:03:06.330> part<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> geometry<00:03:07.590> considering<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
this part of the geometry considering it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280 
this part of the geometry considering it
was<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.250> far<00:03:08.490> out<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:09.330> thinks<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.050> should

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
was so far out it thinks that it should

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.150 
was so far out it thinks that it should
connect<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.280> surface<00:03:11.550> not<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:13.160> so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
connect to this surface not this one so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.970 
connect to this surface not this one so
that's<00:03:14.340> always<00:03:14.550> fun<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.680> we're<00:03:16.800> going<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that's always fun so what we're going to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.290 
that's always fun so what we're going to
do<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.280> we're<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.610> kind<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.850> backtrack<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
do is we're going to kind of backtrack a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.010 
do is we're going to kind of backtrack a
little<00:03:18.420> bit<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:23.550> what<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.720> is

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
little bit and what I'm going to do is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.110 
little bit and what I'm going to do is
again<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> delete<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:28.590> waist

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
again I'm going to delete the waist

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.210 
again I'm going to delete the waist
vertices<00:03:32.000> group<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.350> then<00:03:34.350> in<00:03:34.710> this<00:03:35.160> case

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
vertices group and then in this case

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.530 
vertices group and then in this case
what<00:03:35.730> I'm<00:03:35.820> going<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.540> go<00:03:37.170> through<00:03:37.340> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
what I'm going to do is go through and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.810 
what I'm going to do is go through and
in<00:03:39.540> simulate<00:03:40.080> local<00:03:40.380> mode<00:03:40.590> once<00:03:41.370> again<00:03:41.520> I'm

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
in simulate local mode once again I'm

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.170 
in simulate local mode once again I'm
going<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> let<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:44.070> cloth<00:03:44.370> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.820> pull

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
going to let the the cloth kind of pull

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.620 
going to let the the cloth kind of pull
itself<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.570> together<00:03:47.270> so<00:03:48.270> I'm<00:03:48.360> going<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.510> do

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
itself back together so I'm going to do

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.660 
itself back together so I'm going to do
it<00:03:48.720> damp<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.320> time<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.430> cloth

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
it damp this time so that the the cloth

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.020 
it damp this time so that the the cloth
tends<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.150> settle<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:52.910> little<00:03:53.910> bit<00:03:54.030> more<00:03:56.030> you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
tends to settle a little bit more you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.610 
tends to settle a little bit more you
can<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.360> verts<00:03:57.780> now<00:03:57.990> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.350> coming

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
can see that verts now kind of coming

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.950 
can see that verts now kind of coming
back<00:03:58.740> into<00:03:59.010> line<00:03:59.340> but<00:04:00.270> I'm<00:04:00.300> not<00:04:00.540> getting<00:04:00.810> all

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
back into line but I'm not getting all

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.700 
back into line but I'm not getting all
the<00:04:01.110> pull<00:04:01.350> down<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.460> through<00:04:02.700> gravity

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
the pull down into in through gravity

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.750 
the pull down into in through gravity
and<00:04:04.710> what<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.890> want<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.460> make<00:04:05.490> sure<00:04:05.640> that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and what I want to do is make sure that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.490 
and what I want to do is make sure that
that<00:04:06.030> vert<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.450> actually<00:04:06.750> closer<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.110> this

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that vert is actually closer to this

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.290 
that vert is actually closer to this
part<00:04:07.770> of<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.920> torso<00:04:08.130> than<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.550> is<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.850> arm<00:04:09.060> so

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
part of the torso than it is the arm so

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.200 
part of the torso than it is the arm so
it<00:04:09.360> doesn't<00:04:09.690> get<00:04:09.780> sucked<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.060> did

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
it doesn't get sucked out as it did

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.380 
it doesn't get sucked out as it did
before<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.930> that's<00:04:13.110> another<00:04:13.350> good<00:04:13.590> lesson<00:04:14.390> for

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
before so that's another good lesson for

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.990 
before so that's another good lesson for
you<00:04:15.570> just<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.990> little<00:04:16.230> side<00:04:16.799> tip<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.940> know

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you just a little side tip on you know

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.270 
you just a little side tip on you know
kind<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.270> real-world<00:04:18.510> usage<00:04:19.700> so<00:04:20.700> now<00:04:20.850> I've<00:04:21.060> got

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
kind of real-world usage so now I've got

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.880 
kind of real-world usage so now I've got
this<00:04:23.280> settling<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.210> there<00:04:24.510> ok<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.620> if<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.860> go

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
this settling in there ok so if I go

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.870 
this settling in there ok so if I go
back<00:04:26.010> into<00:04:26.310> groups<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.730> object<00:04:27.090> mode<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.980> have

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.410 

pretty<00:04:32.880> much<00:04:33.120> everything<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.170> top

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
pretty much everything on the top

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.320 
pretty much everything on the top
selected<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:36.600> I'm<00:04:36.690> going<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.900> make<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> group

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
selected so I'm going to make a group

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.780 
selected so I'm going to make a group
waste<00:04:39.330> non<00:04:40.080> bias<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:42.620> surface<00:04:43.670> that's<00:04:44.670> going

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
waste non bias and surface that's going

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.530 
waste non bias and surface that's going
to<00:04:44.880> be<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.090> surface<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.730> now<00:04:48.240> I'm<00:04:48.360> going<00:04:48.480> to

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
to be the surface and now I'm going to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.690 
to be the surface and now I'm going to
simulate<00:04:48.750> local<00:04:49.200> damped<00:04:49.590> whoops<00:04:49.860> before<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> do

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
simulate local damped whoops before I do

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.629 
simulate local damped whoops before I do
that<00:04:52.490> let's<00:04:53.490> go<00:04:53.670> into<00:04:53.850> group

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.739 

taking<00:04:58.639> a<00:04:58.699> little<00:04:58.849> while<00:04:59.059> to<00:04:59.269> get<00:04:59.419> to<00:04:59.479> where<00:04:59.719> I

00:04:59.739 --> 00:04:59.749 
taking a little while to get to where I

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.549 
taking a little while to get to where I
wanted<00:05:00.109> it<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:00.379> be<00:05:02.049> apologize<00:05:03.049> for<00:05:03.259> that<00:05:03.349> but

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:03.559 
wanted it to be apologize for that but

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.139 
wanted it to be apologize for that but
you're<00:05:03.769> you're<00:05:04.129> getting<00:05:04.459> a<00:05:04.519> kind<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:04.879> good

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:05.149 
you're you're getting a kind of a good

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:06.879 
you're you're getting a kind of a good
indication<00:05:05.929> of<00:05:06.079> the<00:05:06.169> workflow<00:05:06.529> and<00:05:06.679> some<00:05:06.799> of

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
indication of the workflow and some of

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.399 
indication of the workflow and some of
the<00:05:06.979> challenges<00:05:07.579> you<00:05:07.939> may<00:05:08.089> face<00:05:08.119> and<00:05:08.659> that's

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
the challenges you may face and that's

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.889 
the challenges you may face and that's
always<00:05:09.799> a<00:05:10.089> handy<00:05:11.089> thing<00:05:11.119> to<00:05:11.299> know<00:05:11.539> as<00:05:11.689> well<00:05:11.869> as

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:11.899 
always a handy thing to know as well as

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:13.539 
always a handy thing to know as well as
to<00:05:12.169> when<00:05:12.319> things<00:05:12.349> kind<00:05:12.769> of<00:05:12.859> go<00:05:13.009> wrong<00:05:13.219> what<00:05:13.429> to

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:13.549 
to when things kind of go wrong what to

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:16.629 
to when things kind of go wrong what to
do<00:05:13.699> to<00:05:13.819> correct<00:05:14.179> them<00:05:14.979> so<00:05:15.979> now<00:05:16.099> I'm<00:05:16.219> back<00:05:16.339> up<00:05:16.549> in

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
do to correct them so now I'm back up in

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.179 
do to correct them so now I'm back up in
Clough<00:05:16.879> X<00:05:17.149> i'll<00:05:17.449> hit<00:05:17.749> simulate<00:05:17.959> local<00:05:18.499> and

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
Clough X i'll hit simulate local and

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.399 
Clough X i'll hit simulate local and
this<00:05:19.309> vert<00:05:19.549> shouldn't<00:05:20.029> jump<00:05:20.419> out<00:05:20.959> here<00:05:21.229> now

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
this vert shouldn't jump out here now

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.359 
this vert shouldn't jump out here now
now<00:05:21.649> it's<00:05:21.949> going<00:05:22.219> towards<00:05:24.159> towards<00:05:25.159> the

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:25.369 
now it's going towards towards the

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:26.949 
now it's going towards towards the
waistline<00:05:25.729> which<00:05:25.939> is<00:05:26.059> where<00:05:26.209> I<00:05:26.239> wanted<00:05:26.599> it<00:05:26.719> to

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:26.959 
waistline which is where I wanted it to

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.350 
waistline which is where I wanted it to
begin<00:05:27.079> with<00:05:27.229> so<00:05:27.759> now<00:05:28.759> i<00:05:28.819> can<00:05:28.909> hit<00:05:29.119> simulate

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
begin with so now i can hit simulate

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.159 
begin with so now i can hit simulate
local<00:05:29.899> and<00:05:31.360> let<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.919> dress<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:35.389> you

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
local and let this this dress and you

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.039 
local and let this this dress and you
know<00:05:36.289> much<00:05:36.529> longer<00:05:36.919> almost<00:05:37.069> ankle-length

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:38.049 
know much longer almost ankle-length

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:40.839 
know much longer almost ankle-length
drape<00:05:39.049> down<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:39.919> let<00:05:40.039> it<00:05:40.069> be<00:05:40.279> affected<00:05:40.729> by

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
drape down and let it be affected by

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:48.459 
drape down and let it be affected by
gravity<00:05:40.909> I<00:05:43.509> think<00:05:44.509> it<00:05:44.629> pretty<00:05:44.839> much<00:05:45.019> is<00:05:47.319> so<00:05:48.319> now

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
gravity I think it pretty much is so now

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.049 
gravity I think it pretty much is so now
I'm<00:05:48.619> ready<00:05:48.799> to<00:05:48.889> simulate<00:05:49.369> so<00:05:49.639> at<00:05:49.729> this<00:05:49.789> point

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.059 
I'm ready to simulate so at this point

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:58.350 
I'm ready to simulate so at this point
let's<00:05:50.360> save<00:05:50.659> again<00:05:51.049> I'm<00:05:51.499> going<00:05:51.619> to<00:05:51.679> save<00:05:51.919> this

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.600 

so<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.389> hit<00:05:59.599> save<00:05:59.869> as

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.450 

okay<00:06:05.330> so<00:06:05.389> i'm<00:06:05.629> going<00:06:05.750> to<00:06:05.810> call<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:07.210> GM<00:06:09.460> aligned

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
okay so i'm going to call it GM aligned

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.860 
okay so i'm going to call it GM aligned
i<00:06:12.669> should<00:06:13.669> say<00:06:13.699> just<00:06:14.509> example<00:06:15.379> aligned<00:06:16.870> that's

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
i should say just example aligned that's

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.600 
i should say just example aligned that's
going<00:06:18.020> to<00:06:18.110> save<00:06:18.379> all<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.650> out<00:06:18.979> for<00:06:19.280> me<00:06:19.460> and

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
going to save all that out for me and

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.369 
going to save all that out for me and
now<00:06:20.330> i<00:06:20.360> can<00:06:20.539> go<00:06:20.629> ahead<00:06:20.719> and<00:06:20.810> start<00:06:21.050> simulating

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
now i can go ahead and start simulating

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.749 
now i can go ahead and start simulating
and<00:06:21.770> i'm<00:06:21.860> going<00:06:21.949> to<00:06:22.039> simulate<00:06:22.219> each<00:06:22.520> one<00:06:22.729> of

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
and i'm going to simulate each one of

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.860 
and i'm going to simulate each one of
these<00:06:23.379> passes<00:06:24.379> separately<00:06:24.860> and<00:06:25.750> instead<00:06:26.750> of

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
these passes separately and instead of

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.240 
these passes separately and instead of
forcing<00:06:27.050> you<00:06:27.229> guys<00:06:27.409> to<00:06:27.590> watch<00:06:27.800> as<00:06:28.069> you've

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
forcing you guys to watch as you've

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.409 
forcing you guys to watch as you've
watched<00:06:28.490> me<00:06:28.699> kind<00:06:28.879> of<00:06:28.969> struggle<00:06:29.270> through

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
watched me kind of struggle through

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.879 
watched me kind of struggle through
getting<00:06:29.569> these<00:06:29.750> things<00:06:29.990> set<00:06:30.139> up<00:06:30.169> when<00:06:30.800> i'm

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
getting these things set up when i'm

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.679 
getting these things set up when i'm
done<00:06:31.129> you'll<00:06:31.370> get<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.639> see<00:06:31.819> themselves<00:06:32.000> stop

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
done you'll get to see themselves stop

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.510 
done you'll get to see themselves stop
now<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:32.930> be<00:06:33.349> back<00:06:33.500> in<00:06:33.530> a<00:06:33.710> little<00:06:33.800> bit<00:06:36.520> alright

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
now and be back in a little bit alright

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.820 
now and be back in a little bit alright
so<00:06:37.909> now<00:06:38.419> that<00:06:38.599> this<00:06:38.689> is<00:06:38.750> done<00:06:38.900> even<00:06:39.740> though

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
so now that this is done even though

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.100 
so now that this is done even though
these<00:06:39.949> dresses<00:06:40.610> aren't<00:06:40.759> exactly<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.449> same<00:06:41.750> i

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
these dresses aren't exactly the same i

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
want you to kind of watch the area right

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.659 
want you to kind of watch the area right
here<00:06:44.629> on<00:06:45.529> both<00:06:45.949> of<00:06:46.159> them<00:06:46.279> because<00:06:46.370> you'll

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
here on both of them because you'll

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:47.950 
here on both of them because you'll
notice<00:06:46.969> that<00:06:47.000> this<00:06:47.300> one<00:06:47.509> is<00:06:47.599> going<00:06:47.719> to<00:06:47.779> give

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
notice that this one is going to give

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.390 
notice that this one is going to give
you<00:06:48.050> some<00:06:48.229> interesting<00:06:48.439> stretching<00:06:51.189> that<00:06:52.189> the

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
you some interesting stretching that the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:02.820 
you some interesting stretching that the
other<00:06:52.550> one<00:06:52.729> doesn't<00:06:52.909> provide

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.290 

until<00:07:03.550> you<00:07:03.670> can<00:07:03.850> see<00:07:04.210> that<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:08.670> the<00:07:09.670> skirt<00:07:10.000> is

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
until you can see that the the skirt is

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.870 
until you can see that the the skirt is
actually<00:07:10.720> behaving<00:07:11.140> according<00:07:12.130> to<00:07:12.550> the<00:07:12.670> cloth

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
actually behaving according to the cloth

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.850 
actually behaving according to the cloth
so<00:07:13.090> you're<00:07:13.210> going<00:07:13.300> to<00:07:13.390> get<00:07:13.510> folds<00:07:14.170> in

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
so you're going to get folds in

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.130 
so you're going to get folds in
different<00:07:15.820> ways<00:07:16.000> than<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:16.930> would<00:07:18.810> across<00:07:19.810> the

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
different ways than you would across the

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.530 
different ways than you would across the
same<00:07:20.410> thing<00:07:20.770> here<00:07:21.340> you're<00:07:22.120> going<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.360> get

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:22.540 
same thing here you're going to get

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.150 
same thing here you're going to get
different<00:07:22.840> types<00:07:23.170> of<00:07:23.320> creasing<00:07:23.770> because<00:07:24.070> of

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
different types of creasing because of

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.520 
different types of creasing because of
the<00:07:24.250> bias<00:07:24.520> cut<00:07:24.880> cloth<00:07:25.210> now<00:07:25.540> and<00:07:25.840> that's

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
the bias cut cloth now and that's

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.900 
the bias cut cloth now and that's
something<00:07:26.740> to<00:07:26.890> keep<00:07:27.070> in<00:07:27.190> mind<00:07:27.250> if<00:07:27.580> you<00:07:27.670> want<00:07:27.700> to

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910 
something to keep in mind if you want to

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.610 
something to keep in mind if you want to
start<00:07:28.030> doing<00:07:28.150> comes<00:07:28.450> from<00:07:28.600> some<00:07:29.140> rather

exotic looking clothing start putting

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.670 
exotic looking clothing start putting
your<00:07:33.580> panels<00:07:33.940> at<00:07:34.150> odd<00:07:34.600> angles<00:07:34.840> instead<00:07:35.650> of

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
your panels at odd angles instead of

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.190 
your panels at odd angles instead of
