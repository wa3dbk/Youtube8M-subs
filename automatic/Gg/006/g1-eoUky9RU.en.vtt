 i 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.269
 Y 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.079
 and the full analysis of the famous and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.949
 criticized playstation3 super slim ultra 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:36.390
 slim as it is already known by the model 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:41.040
 40 11 a of 500 gb 40 11 see what is this 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 model of 250 gb and the 40 11 that has 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.409
 a capacity of 2 gb exclusive for 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 europe this playstation 3 model 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:54.510
 super slim is 50% lighter and 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.239
 small than the playstation fat and 25% 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.939
 lighter and smaller than normal 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.589
 slim the operating system has always 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.960
 been the same as in all 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.390
 previous playstation3 the only thing that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 changes in this model is the way in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.740
 that the discs are inserted 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.990
 this console to see that the other 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.479
 it supports being in vertical mode always and 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.820
 when we have the support to be able 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.220
 stop it which is situated in the part 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.040
 left side of our playstation 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 3 that by the way is below 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.670
 this sonic rubber logo preserves 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.100
 the two usb ports but this time 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.410
 disappears the wifi indicator remaining 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.979
 only the functionality indicator 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.979
 of the hard disk 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.600
 the button to insert and to open the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 input tray 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 everyone who reads us playstation3 the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.030
 logo that always stays active is not 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.070
 move 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.560
 and the button to turn on and off the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.049
 console at the beginning I thought it was a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.540
 foolishness compare to the playstation3 its 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.250
 newspaper in play 2 but as not 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.740
 I have other models of playstation 3 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.259
 Slim or peace as separate account yo 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.569
 I am a poor person I have only my 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.280
 playstation 2 this I do it simply 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.709
 for you to give an idea in case 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.959
 they have a playstation 2 at home is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.569
 the back of what is the play 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.340
 station 2 and play 3 you can give 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.440
 account to the playstation3 is obviously 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.760
 thicker just so it's in a 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.530
 idea of â€‹â€‹the dimensions of the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.600
 playstation3 as you can realize 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.750
 in playstation 2 and you can move the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.670
 sony logo 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.080
 playstation3 suffer from ps2 are very 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 similar in the way of the house you 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.000
 sensible the disk since it is in mode 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.769
 manual and traditional mode 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.239
 obviously the pr 3 does not have 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.010
 functionality with the tubes 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.599
 playstation 2 in case someone 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.360
 I wondering how they differ from the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.970
 discs of play 3 and play 2 is obviously 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660
 obvious that the truth here is of the style 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.550
 game cube from before and playstation 2 here 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.790
 is the straight line divided 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.580
 and blu-ray and hence obviously this is 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.100
 exactly the same only that the legs of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.570
 back and obviously the wounded brand 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.250
 of water are different good friends 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.010
 after a week of having this 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.010
 console the truth so many criticisms to me 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.990
 network the truth I have not been disappointed or 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.360
 I could not tell you that this console 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.820
 because it does not comply with what I did in 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.200
 criticism is a very good console the 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.900
 true if this Havana if you look 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.930
 fracking since if it's plastic 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.750
 obviously but the truth is not for 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.820
 to break remember that this console is 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.040
 a tabletop console is not a 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.370
 console how is 3ds that we have in the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.860
 hand 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.470
 obviously not this console is going to be in 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.180
 your furniture if it is careful obviously what 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.130
 which is true is that it sticks to 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.880
 spots of the fingers there is marked 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.880
 to give an account and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.220
 does not like anyone but gives a 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.380
 appearance of elegance the effect formed 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.150
 of a console another thing that is also 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.670
 true is that here is stored a lot 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.130
 dust something that is not very good and then the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.020
 true 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.830
 as they say for them a greater of cheeses 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.870
 de vigo ducsa and well the truth then yes 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.300
 you have a console that costs so 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.800
 expensive as a playstation 3 obviously 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.220
 You have to give maintenance 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.330
 due to clean it to pass a rag I do not know 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.799
 Obviously you will not have to fix that 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.110
 console will be like dust 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.210
 a friend subscriber asked me if 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.740
 he could buy this console if they 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.509
 I say I would recommend it and obviously 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.180
 friends that I recommend the truth 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.389
 choose between a slim and a super slim 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.789
 it's just a matter of taste because 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.250
 pity it was a little more firm and 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.590
 The advantage of inserting your discs 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.360
 traditional mode of playstation but 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.569
 this console will obviously have the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.169
 same cheaper price 250 gigas that 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.610
 they are 90 gigs more than that of 160 and then the 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.770
 true if you want something more than 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.199
 capacity you can choose to buy by 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.090
 the 500 gb and then friends up here my 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.090
 small analysis of the playstation3 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.849
 super slim if you have questions here in 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.159
 the comments of the I will answer all and 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.159
 I'm mister mister anitec until next time
