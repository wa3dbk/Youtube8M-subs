00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.170
 this hole was made about two months ago 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.759
 in early winter and now that 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.650
 is finalizing I will perform the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.079
 planting a notice from 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.270
 highlight is the hole has already suffered the 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.160
 weathering processes and what we're going 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.289
 do now all features 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.060
 of the plantation is to reintroduce 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.890
 the earth in the hole we will add the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.439
 earth removing large stones 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.029
 and watering clods proceeding like this 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.650
 we get the earth well 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.970
 loose we facilitate the development 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.970
 Root from our stake 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 after finishing accumulating all the earth 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.800
 it may seem that we have excess 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.990
 but this should not worry us 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.520
 now we are loose as it passes 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.590
 the time and effect among others of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 the rains will be compacted little to 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 little bit 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
 to improve the characteristics of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 land in the area where we are going to place 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 the stake we open a small hole and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.550
 we provide topsoil that is then 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 mix with the rest 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 I would have the land ready to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.500
 perform the plantation I have a piece of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500
 dis 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.350
 and the practically definitive size of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 the stake responsible for the box office is a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.510
 form of vegetative multiplication by 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.690
 which we are going to get a plant 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.570
 identical to the mother plant of 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.110
 which we have sustained it is about 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.740
 a semi woody stake because this the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.390
 branch of the same year 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 has now been cut off at the end of the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.550
 winter 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.590
 and what we are going to do is adapt 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.050
 it has a size of about 20 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.840
 centimeters approximately 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.210
 I will use hormones to facilitate the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.070
 confrontation with the hormones not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.400
 it means that we are going to have a success 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
 100% but yes we will facilitate 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.210
 root development in those 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.400
 species 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.950
 that is not the case of the vine but in 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.950
 those species the rooting is 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.280
 more complicated we will favor that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.960
 rooting the plant in this case 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 if we did not use hormones 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.610
 the first cut of the upper bud 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.890
 It would be approximately this height 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 one centimeter of the main call 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.640
 which is going to be the one that interests us 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.720
 favor development for the part of 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.990
 area 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.180
 if we do not use hormones we would help 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.180
 cuts just below the yolk 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.800
 so that as in that place it concentrates 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.990
 the greatest amount of hormones that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.580
 would facilitate rooting the 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.270
 concentration that point as I say the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.760
 hormones as is not the case 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.620
 and that we're going to use hormones and we're going 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.780
 to give a cut in this case if you are going to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 match because we have more wood 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.790
 we have and now what we are going to do 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.570
 now it's going to be to improve the cut with the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.570
 restless blade 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.640
 do not touch 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 part i 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.800
 that is being cleaned with the knife for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 do not contaminate those areas with a dust 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.819
 ground with bacteria with microorganisms 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.459
 that could damage the future plant and 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.880
 above all hinder the development 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.880
 radicular 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.680
 we enter the box office in the boat 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.569
 so that the hormones adhere in 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.489
 this powder case to the area where 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.510
 we want the roots to develop and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.510
 we shake off the excess 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.340
 the next thing is to introduce the stake into 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.560
 the land can help us with a 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.750
 pot adore planter failing with 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.610
 the hand is recommended to bury the stake 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.290
 about two-thirds or three-quarters of its 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.510
 total length what we should 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.900
 make sure not to bury the yolk 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.900
 terminal 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.239
 you have to compact the earth well 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.890
 around the boxes so that the 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.120
 contact between earth and plant material 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.980
 be good 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.320
 we will contribute land to practically 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.150
 bury the whole stake free like I said 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.650
 before as time goes by it will go 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.799
 compacting and will be at the level of 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.799
 ground 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.599
 we make a small tree or groove 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.310
 around the stakes and we do the 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.469
 plantation irrigation for in addition to 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 provide water to facilitate contact between 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.759
 earth and plant material can be seen 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.199
 that watering compacts the land and 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.199
 decreases the volume of the earth 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.110
 to get the humidity to stay 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 more time on the ground and avoid losses 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.630
 by evaporation we deposit a layer of 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.290
 dry land over wet areas 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.290
 I have here 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.210
 a small rod that will be worth 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.300
 first to avoid 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.850
 without realizing or by some carelessness 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.130
 we made the lockers we're going to mark 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.740
 let's mark your location and in a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:14.300
 future once you develop that 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.500
 bud can serve us as a tutor for the 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.960
 for the new plant 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.980
 but that I have this video we find 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.980
 complicated to perform
