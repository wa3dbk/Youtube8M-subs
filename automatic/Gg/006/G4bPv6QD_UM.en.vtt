00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.380 

I'd<00:00:03.750> like<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.110> talk<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:05.490> newer<00:00:05.790> procedure

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I'd like to talk about a newer procedure

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.870 
I'd like to talk about a newer procedure
for<00:00:07.049> shoulder<00:00:07.589> replacement<00:00:08.280> that's<00:00:08.460> referred

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
for shoulder replacement that's referred

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.459 
for shoulder replacement that's referred
to<00:00:08.910> as<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> reverse<00:00:09.960> total<00:00:10.290> shoulder

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
to as the reverse total shoulder

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.780 
to as the reverse total shoulder
arthroplasty<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.349> it's<00:00:13.349> new<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> sense

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
arthroplasty and it's new in the sense

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
arthroplasty and it's new in the sense
that<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.240> been<00:00:15.450> done<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> United<00:00:15.900> States

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that it's been done in the United States

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.090 
that it's been done in the United States
for<00:00:16.619> maybe<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.520> past<00:00:17.760> five<00:00:18.060> six<00:00:18.810> years<00:00:18.980> but<00:00:19.980> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
for maybe the past five six years but it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.189 
for maybe the past five six years but it
is<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.580> model<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.480> has<00:00:21.600> been<00:00:21.900> done<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.080> Europe

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is a model that has been done in Europe

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.130 
is a model that has been done in Europe
for<00:00:22.650> 20<00:00:22.920> years<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.660> procedure

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
for 20 years or more so it's a procedure

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
for 20 years or more so it's a procedure
that<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.740> brought<00:00:26.010> over<00:00:26.039> from<00:00:26.519> Europe<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that was brought over from Europe and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.580 
that was brought over from Europe and
there's<00:00:27.240> quite<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> bit<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> experience<00:00:28.230> there

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
there's quite a bit of experience there

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
there's quite a bit of experience there
it's<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:30.060> specific<00:00:32.360> individual<00:00:33.360> who's<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
it's a very specific individual who's a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's a very specific individual who's a
candidate<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.010> reverse<00:00:35.430> shoulder

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
candidate for the reverse shoulder

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
candidate for the reverse shoulder
replacement<00:00:36.600> when<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.559> talk<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:37.860> shoulder

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
replacement when we talk about shoulder

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
replacement when we talk about shoulder
replacements<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.210> general<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.140> two

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
replacements in general there are two

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
replacements in general there are two
types<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.930> talked<00:00:42.930> about

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
types the one that I just talked about

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
types the one that I just talked about
and<00:00:43.410> we'll<00:00:43.590> continue<00:00:43.890> talking<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and we'll continue talking about the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
and we'll continue talking about the
reverse<00:00:45.090> total<00:00:45.360> shoulder<00:00:45.570> arthroplasty<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
reverse total shoulder arthroplasty and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.389 
reverse total shoulder arthroplasty and
then<00:00:47.460> there's<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> primary<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.690> anatomic

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
then there's the primary or anatomic

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.860 
then there's the primary or anatomic
total<00:00:50.399> shoulder<00:00:50.700> arthroplasty<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
total shoulder arthroplasty which is the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.130 
total shoulder arthroplasty which is the
most<00:00:52.079> common<00:00:53.270> shoulder<00:00:54.270> replacement<00:00:55.020> that's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
most common shoulder replacement that's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
most common shoulder replacement that's
done<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.010> primarily<00:00:56.370> done<00:00:57.059> for

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
done and that's primarily done for

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
done and that's primarily done for
arthritis<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> shoulder<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
arthritis of the shoulder when the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
arthritis of the shoulder when the
shoulder<00:00:59.250> Lorde's<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.719> reverse<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.530> done

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
shoulder Lorde's out the reverse is done

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.329 
shoulder Lorde's out the reverse is done
for<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:03.210> thright<00:01:03.960> us<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.379> has<00:01:04.559> developed<00:01:04.949> as

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
for our thright us that has developed as

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.500 
for our thright us that has developed as
a<00:01:05.369> result<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.439> rotator<00:01:07.439> cuff<00:01:07.880> deficiency<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
a result of rotator cuff deficiency so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.679 
a result of rotator cuff deficiency so
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.159> specifically<00:01:11.159> designed<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
this is specifically designed for the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
this is specifically designed for the
patient<00:01:13.200> who<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.979> only<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.520> our<00:01:14.670> practice<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
patient who not only has our practice in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.920 
patient who not only has our practice in
the<00:01:15.420> shoulder<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.200> arthritis<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.070> has

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
the shoulder but has arthritis and has

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.920 
the shoulder but has arthritis and has
lost<00:01:18.930> their<00:01:19.229> rotator<00:01:19.650> cuff<00:01:20.360> those<00:01:21.360> patients

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
lost their rotator cuff those patients

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.649 
lost their rotator cuff those patients
are<00:01:22.049> typically<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.430> their<00:01:24.210> 80s

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
are typically in there in their 80s

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
are typically in there in their 80s
though<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.470> occur<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.100> younger<00:01:26.790> patients

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
though it can occur in younger patients

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.350 
though it can occur in younger patients
but<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> most<00:01:28.080> common<00:01:28.759> individual<00:01:29.759> are<00:01:30.030> in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but the most common individual are in

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.230 
but the most common individual are in
their<00:01:30.540> 80s<00:01:30.960> before<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> condition<00:01:32.520> develops

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
their 80s before this condition develops

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
their 80s before this condition develops
but<00:01:33.540> unfortunately<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.950> happens<00:01:35.400> when<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
but unfortunately what happens when the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
but unfortunately what happens when the
rotator<00:01:36.090> cuff<00:01:36.259> completely<00:01:37.259> deteriorates

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
rotator cuff completely deteriorates

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
rotator cuff completely deteriorates
with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.700> arthritis<00:01:38.970> condition<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
with this arthritis condition is the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
with this arthritis condition is the
patients<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:41.970> difficult<00:01:42.240> time

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
patients have a very difficult time

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.050 
patients have a very difficult time
lifting<00:01:43.079> their<00:01:43.290> arm<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.829> many<00:01:44.070> cases<00:01:44.700> they

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
lifting their arm and in many cases they

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
lifting their arm and in many cases they
are<00:01:45.299> unable<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.869> lift<00:01:46.380> their<00:01:46.619> arm<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.310> call

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
are unable to lift their arm and we call

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
are unable to lift their arm and we call
this<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> pseudo<00:01:48.420> paralysis<00:01:49.200> they're<00:01:49.470> not

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this a pseudo paralysis they're not

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.310 
this a pseudo paralysis they're not
actually<00:01:50.100> paralyzed<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:52.110> unable

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
actually paralyzed but they are unable

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800 
actually paralyzed but they are unable
to<00:01:52.530> lift<00:01:52.979> their<00:01:53.220> arm<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> rotator

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
to lift their arm because the rotator

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.889 
to lift their arm because the rotator
cuff<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.350> gone<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.579> ball<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:57.240> ridden<00:01:57.719> up

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
cuff is gone and the ball has ridden up

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
cuff is gone and the ball has ridden up
high<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:58.979> unable<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.490> lift

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
high so that they are unable to lift

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.490 
high so that they are unable to lift
their

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
their

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.860 
their
or<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.510> procedure

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
or the way that we do this procedure

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.680 
or the way that we do this procedure
here<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:06.170> certainly<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:08.030> one<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.210> imagine

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
here is certainly as one can imagine

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.810 
here is certainly as one can imagine
it's<00:02:09.869> done<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> hospital<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.310> basically

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
it's done in the hospital but basically

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.100 
it's done in the hospital but basically
the<00:02:12.120> operation<00:02:13.080> itself<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.860> done<00:02:14.670> by<00:02:15.120> placing

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the operation itself is done by placing

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.480 
the operation itself is done by placing
the<00:02:16.470> ball<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:18.300> socket<00:02:18.750> portion<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the ball on the socket portion and the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.030 
the ball on the socket portion and the
socket<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.780> ball<00:02:21.990> portion<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.800> that's

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
socket on the ball portion and that's

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.370 
socket on the ball portion and that's
why<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.700> called<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.360> reverse<00:02:24.750> because<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
why it's called a reverse because the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.610 
why it's called a reverse because the
ball<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.800> socket<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.490> reversed<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:28.320> way

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
ball and socket are reversed and the way

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220 
ball and socket are reversed and the way
it's<00:02:28.830> done<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.520> basically<00:02:30.270> after<00:02:30.510> we<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.050> our

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
it's done is basically after we do our

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.110 
it's done is basically after we do our
surgery<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> operating<00:02:32.460> room

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
surgery and you're in the operating room

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.820 
surgery and you're in the operating room
we<00:02:33.810> will<00:02:34.140> expose<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.430> ball<00:02:35.940> portion<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> we

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
we will expose the ball portion and we

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370 
we will expose the ball portion and we
will<00:02:38.010> remove<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.670> top<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> ball<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.350> that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
will remove the top of the ball so that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.790 
will remove the top of the ball so that
it<00:02:40.830> exposes<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.090> opens<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.110> shaft<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.740> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it exposes and opens up the shaft of the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.090 
it exposes and opens up the shaft of the
arm<00:02:44.670> bone<00:02:45.120> or<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.480> humerus<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.650> call<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
arm bone or the humerus as we call it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.670 
arm bone or the humerus as we call it
and<00:02:47.570> hopefully<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and hopefully you can see this on the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.250 
and hopefully you can see this on the
video<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:50.820> there<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> stem<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:51.959> going

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
video that there is a stem that's going

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.550 
video that there is a stem that's going
through<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:53.280> acrylic<00:02:53.910> model<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.380> can

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
through this acrylic model that you can

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
through this acrylic model that you can
see<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> stem<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.610> down<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.360> this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
see that the stem is going down and this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.000 
see that the stem is going down and this
stem<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.840> cemented<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.830> place<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.360> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
stem is cemented in place so that a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.420 
stem is cemented in place so that a
socket<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:03.000> shaped<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:05.280> be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
socket that's shaped like this can be

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.320 
socket that's shaped like this can be
applied<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.840> secured<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.800> place<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.300> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
applied and secured in place we do a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.160 
applied and secured in place we do a
similar<00:03:09.660> procedure<00:03:10.050> on<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.540> socket<00:03:12.540> portion

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
similar procedure on the socket portion

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.040 
similar procedure on the socket portion
where<00:03:13.410> we<00:03:13.590> place<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> base<00:03:14.670> plate<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.300> if<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
where we place a base plate and if you

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.900 
where we place a base plate and if you
can<00:03:16.200> see<00:03:16.470> through<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> acrylic<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.489> can<00:03:17.670> see

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
can see through the acrylic you can see

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.910 
can see through the acrylic you can see
there<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.209> screws<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.140> base<00:03:19.380> plate<00:03:19.530> that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
there are screws in this base plate that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.550 
there are screws in this base plate that
hold<00:03:20.220> us<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.550> place<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.600> actually<00:03:22.200> grows

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
hold us in place and this actually grows

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.729 
hold us in place and this actually grows
into<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.220> bone<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.910> once<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.170> secured

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
into the bone and once this is secured

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.670 
into the bone and once this is secured
in<00:03:25.980> surgery<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.420> different<00:03:27.840> sized<00:03:28.110> balls

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
in surgery we have different sized balls

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500 
in surgery we have different sized balls
that<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.280> put<00:03:29.489> on<00:03:29.610> there<00:03:29.820> depending<00:03:30.299> on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that we can put on there depending on

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.720 
that we can put on there depending on
the<00:03:30.750> size<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.290> patient<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:31.980> gets

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
the size of the patient and that gets

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.600 
the size of the patient and that gets
locked<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.239> place<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.250> arm

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
locked in place and then we put the arm

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.420 
locked in place and then we put the arm
back<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.150> into<00:03:36.720> its<00:03:36.900> socket<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:38.040> allows

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
back in into its socket and this allows

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.650 
back in into its socket and this allows
the<00:03:38.970> arm<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.860> have<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.220> what's<00:03:41.610> called<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.180> semi

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the arm to have a what's called a semi

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
the arm to have a what's called a semi
constrained<00:03:43.290> model<00:03:43.769> where<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.100> socket<00:03:44.640> fits

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
constrained model where the socket fits

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.670 
constrained model where the socket fits
in<00:03:45.150> there<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.600> when<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> lift<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.230> arm<00:03:46.470> up

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
in there and when you lift the arm up

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.920 
in there and when you lift the arm up
this<00:03:47.220> holds<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:47.940> place<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.690> ball

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
this holds it in place so that the ball

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.500 
this holds it in place so that the ball
is<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.350> riding<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.430> rotator<00:03:50.880> cuff<00:03:51.209> which

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
is not riding and the rotator cuff which

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.620 
is not riding and the rotator cuff which
is<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.320> area<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.910> not<00:03:54.120> needed<00:03:54.600> for

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
is in this area if it is not needed for

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.170 
is in this area if it is not needed for
function<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.440> that's<00:03:56.100> basically<00:03:56.610> how<00:03:56.730> we<00:03:56.910> do

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
function and that's basically how we do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.720 
function and that's basically how we do
this<00:03:57.360> procedure
