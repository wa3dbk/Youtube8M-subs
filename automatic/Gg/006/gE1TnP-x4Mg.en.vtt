00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
yeah well hello youtube I had a guy send

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.650 
yeah well hello youtube I had a guy send
me<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.720> message<00:00:22.720> asking<00:00:23.410> me<00:00:23.619> about<00:00:23.800> my<00:00:24.660> mounts

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
me a message asking me about my mounts

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.220 
me a message asking me about my mounts
that<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.869> made<00:00:26.080> for<00:00:26.349> my<00:00:27.480> 455<00:00:28.480> that<00:00:28.840> work<00:00:28.990> with<00:00:29.199> a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
that I made for my 455 that work with a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.880 
that I made for my 455 that work with a
x-series<00:00:30.099> mount<00:00:30.490> I<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:32.500> thought<00:00:32.650> that<00:00:32.860> I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
x-series mount I just thought that I

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.940 
x-series mount I just thought that I
would<00:00:33.750> show<00:00:34.750> him<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.990> little<00:00:35.290> bit<00:00:35.410> here<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:35.650> guess

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
would show him a little bit here I guess

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.940 
would show him a little bit here I guess
it's<00:00:36.220> gonna<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.460> pretty<00:00:36.760> short<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.090> sweet

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
it's gonna be pretty short and sweet

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.010 
it's gonna be pretty short and sweet
I<00:00:38.980> made<00:00:39.670> some<00:00:39.850> attachments<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.630> went<00:00:40.810> on<00:00:40.900> the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
I made some attachments that went on the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.410 
I made some attachments that went on the
end<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.440> frame<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> 455<00:00:42.580> so<00:00:43.270> that<00:00:43.390> I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
end of the frame on the 455 so that I

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.320 
end of the frame on the 455 so that I
wouldn't<00:00:43.840> have<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.080> modify<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:45.330> x-series

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
wouldn't have to modify the x-series

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.060 
wouldn't have to modify the x-series
mount<00:00:46.750> or<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.680> 455<00:00:48.190> because<00:00:48.790> I<00:00:49.830> really<00:00:50.830> didn't

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
mount or the 455 because I really didn't

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.190 
mount or the 455 because I really didn't
want<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.280> cut<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.580> my<00:00:51.730> 455<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.810> love<00:00:53.050> these

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
want to cut up my 455 and I love these

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.450 
want to cut up my 455 and I love these
mowers<00:00:53.470> I<00:00:53.590> think<00:00:53.860> they're<00:00:54.010> probably<00:00:54.190> one<00:00:54.430> of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
mowers I think they're probably one of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.080 
mowers I think they're probably one of
the<00:00:54.580> best<00:00:54.760> mowers<00:00:55.090> ever<00:00:55.510> made<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:56.950> I<00:00:57.670> didn't

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
the best mowers ever made and I didn't

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.580 
the best mowers ever made and I didn't
want<00:00:58.240> to<00:00:58.270> cut<00:00:58.450> up<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.660> x-series<00:00:58.990> mount<00:00:59.350> and

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
want to cut up the x-series mount and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.870 
want to cut up the x-series mount and
modify<00:01:00.040> that<00:01:00.070> because<00:01:00.990> someday<00:01:01.990> I<00:01:02.610> may<00:01:03.610> end<00:01:03.790> up

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
modify that because someday I may end up

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.800 
modify that because someday I may end up
getting<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.600> X<00:01:05.260> series<00:01:05.530> mower<00:01:06.600> we've<00:01:07.600> got<00:01:07.780> a

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
getting a X series mower we've got a

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.149 
getting a X series mower we've got a
pretty<00:01:07.990> big<00:01:08.079> acreage<00:01:08.530> here<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.979> we<00:01:09.880> run<00:01:11.159> two

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
pretty big acreage here and we run two

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.609 
pretty big acreage here and we run two
Moore's<00:01:12.429> the<00:01:12.670> way<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.000> I've<00:01:13.240> got<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.450> 525<00:01:14.320> and

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
Moore's the way it is I've got a 525 and

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.910 
Moore's the way it is I've got a 525 and
this<00:01:14.920> 455<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.359> I've<00:01:16.509> got<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.780> snapper<00:01:17.530> sitting

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
this 455 and I've got a snapper sitting

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.580 
this 455 and I've got a snapper sitting
over<00:01:18.100> there<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.490> broken<00:01:19.320> most<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
over there that is broken most of the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.389 
over there that is broken most of the
time<00:01:22.140> maybe<00:01:23.140> someday<00:01:23.619> I'll<00:01:23.859> get<00:01:24.039> that<00:01:24.189> thing

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
time maybe someday I'll get that thing

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.989 
time maybe someday I'll get that thing
reliable<00:01:25.329> but<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.689> doubt<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:26.460> anyway<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.789> is

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
reliable but I doubt it anyway this is

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.340 
reliable but I doubt it anyway this is
my<00:01:28.109> 455<00:01:29.109> and<00:01:29.409> I<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.390> put<00:01:31.539> this<00:01:31.659> on<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:32.170> just

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
my 455 and I just put this on here just

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.039 
my 455 and I just put this on here just
for<00:01:32.859> demonstrational<00:01:33.490> purposes<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:35.020> show

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
for demonstrational purposes to show

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.099 
for demonstrational purposes to show
that<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.499> actually<00:01:35.560> does<00:01:35.920> work<00:01:36.929> it's<00:01:37.929> got

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
that it actually does work it's got

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.340 
that it actually does work it's got
spider<00:01:38.829> webs<00:01:39.009> on<00:01:39.189> it<00:01:40.920> okay

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
spider webs on it okay

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
spider webs on it okay
take<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.499> off<00:01:44.770> now<00:01:45.389> you<00:01:46.389> can<00:01:46.600> see<00:01:46.810> these<00:01:47.350> two

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
take that off now you can see these two

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.160 
take that off now you can see these two
additions<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.569> built<00:01:49.780> for<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:49.990> end<00:01:50.139> of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
additions that I built for the end of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.620 
additions that I built for the end of
the<00:01:50.259> frame<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.770> didn't<00:01:51.549> drill<00:01:51.759> any<00:01:51.999> holes<00:01:52.060> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the frame I didn't drill any holes in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.279 
the frame I didn't drill any holes in
the<00:01:53.560> 455<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.549> just<00:01:54.819> used<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.329> existing<00:01:55.810> holes

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
the 455 I just used the existing holes

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.870 
the 455 I just used the existing holes
in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.590> frame<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.219> see<00:01:57.399> they<00:01:57.549> put<00:01:57.729> some

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
in the frame you can see they put some

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
in the frame you can see they put some
extra<00:01:57.999> holes<00:01:59.579> in<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.729> frames<00:02:00.969> on<00:02:01.270> these<00:02:01.479> for

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
extra holes in the frames on these for

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.910 
extra holes in the frames on these for
the<00:02:04.240> bucket<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.719> suppose<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.499> maybe<00:02:05.649> some

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the bucket I suppose and maybe some

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800 
the bucket I suppose and maybe some
other<00:02:06.069> attachments<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.850> guess<00:02:06.999> I'm<00:02:07.179> not<00:02:07.329> 100%

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
other attachments I guess I'm not 100%

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.290 
other attachments I guess I'm not 100%
sure<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.740> left<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.580> bolt<00:02:09.850> loose<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.270> that

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
sure but I left this bolt loose so that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.950 
sure but I left this bolt loose so that
I<00:02:10.420> could<00:02:10.660> take<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.990> off<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.319> show<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.280 

I've<00:02:15.960> just<00:02:16.110> got<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.850> bowl<00:02:17.850> hold<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
I've just got a bowl hold now and it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.160 
I've just got a bowl hold now and it
comes<00:02:19.470> off<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:21.750> doesn't

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
comes off like that this doesn't

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
comes off like that this doesn't
actually<00:02:22.320> thread<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.160> anything<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.600> got

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
actually thread in anything I just got

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.570 
actually thread in anything I just got
it<00:02:25.080> sitting<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:28.050> for<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.070> guide<00:02:29.310> pin

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it sitting there just for a guide pin

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.450 
it sitting there just for a guide pin
basically<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.420> hold<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> straight<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.760> there

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
basically to hold it straight in there

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.150 
basically to hold it straight in there
so<00:02:36.050> it's<00:02:37.050> held<00:02:37.230> together<00:02:37.380> down<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
so it's held together down here on the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.820 
so it's held together down here on the
bottom<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.690> can't<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.080> anywhere<00:02:40.320> side<00:02:40.710> to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
bottom and it can't go anywhere side to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
bottom and it can't go anywhere side to
side<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.280> top<00:02:41.310> up<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.230> because<00:02:43.230> it's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
side on the top up here because it's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.730 
side on the top up here because it's
hitting<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:45.260> just<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.410> way<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
hitting here just the way that I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.490 
hitting here just the way that I
designed<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:48.150> pinches<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
designed it it pinches it in there and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.580 
designed it it pinches it in there and
it<00:02:52.590> can't<00:02:52.800> go<00:02:52.920> anywhere

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
it can't go anywhere

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.010 
it can't go anywhere
and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.860> notched<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.370> out<00:02:56.490> here<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.690> weld

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and I notched it out here for this weld

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.080 
and I notched it out here for this weld
on<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.710> 455<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.700> didn't<00:02:59.910> want<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
on the 455 because I didn't want to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.920 
on the 455 because I didn't want to
grind<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.480> out

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
grind that out

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.710 
grind that out
I<00:03:01.040> wanted<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.100> leave<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.430> as<00:03:02.820> stock<00:03:03.120> as<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.450> could

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
I wanted to leave it as stock as I could

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.980 
I wanted to leave it as stock as I could
I<00:03:04.400> don't<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> most<00:03:05.940> precise<00:03:06.330> tools<00:03:06.660> here

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
I don't have the most precise tools here

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.780 
I don't have the most precise tools here
you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.320> see<00:03:07.500> my<00:03:07.620> holes<00:03:07.830> are<00:03:08.040> pretty<00:03:08.250> jagged<00:03:08.520> I

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you can see my holes are pretty jagged I

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can see my holes are pretty jagged I
just<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> torch<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.750> cut<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.020> out<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:11.120> just

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
just use the torch to cut it out I just

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.300 
just use the torch to cut it out I just
used<00:03:12.510> some<00:03:12.750> some<00:03:13.290> flat<00:03:13.560> socks<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.160> bar

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
used some some flat socks in the bar

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.270 
used some some flat socks in the bar
stock<00:03:15.050> there's<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> piece<00:03:16.290> here<00:03:16.620> piece<00:03:17.010> here

piece<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.709> cut<00:03:19.709> them<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.980> different

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
piece here I cut them to different

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.560 
piece here I cut them to different
lengths<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.270> cut<00:03:21.480> some<00:03:22.610> some<00:03:23.610> angles<00:03:24.420> in

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
lengths and you cut some some angles in

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.610 
lengths and you cut some some angles in
them<00:03:24.660> make<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.290> look<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.590> bit<00:03:25.770> better

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
them make it look a little bit better

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.660
