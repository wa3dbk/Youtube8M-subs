comedians called wigglin which are made
by<00:00:09.170> taking<00:00:09.530> a<00:00:09.740> naturally<00:00:10.160> drive<00:00:10.400> oil<00:00:10.670> like

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
by taking a naturally drive oil like

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.480 
by taking a naturally drive oil like
linseed<00:00:11.450> oil<00:00:11.539> or<00:00:11.870> soy<00:00:12.379> oil<00:00:12.740> and<00:00:13.070> chemically

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
linseed oil or soy oil and chemically

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.700 
linseed oil or soy oil and chemically
treating<00:00:13.969> it<00:00:14.120> with<00:00:14.450> alcohol<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.170> acid<00:00:15.559> which

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
treating it with alcohol and acid which

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.350 
treating it with alcohol and acid which
is<00:00:15.830> where<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.070> name<00:00:16.219> comes<00:00:16.400> from<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:17.119> take<00:00:17.240> the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
is where the name comes from to take the

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.120 
is where the name comes from to take the
first<00:00:17.570> part<00:00:17.779> of<00:00:17.810> alcohol<00:00:18.290> and<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.710> last<00:00:18.890> part

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
first part of alcohol and the last part

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.550 
first part of alcohol and the last part
of<00:00:19.160> acid<00:00:19.580> you<00:00:19.669> get<00:00:19.790> the<00:00:19.880> word<00:00:20.000> alkyd<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:20.930> what

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
of acid you get the word alkyd and what

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.290 
of acid you get the word alkyd and what
the<00:00:21.650> alkanes<00:00:21.949> do<00:00:22.189> is<00:00:22.340> they<00:00:22.490> speed<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.029> drying

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
the alkanes do is they speed the drying

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.170 
the alkanes do is they speed the drying
rate<00:00:23.600> of<00:00:23.840> a<00:00:23.930> conventional<00:00:24.410> oil<00:00:24.730> by<00:00:25.730> about<00:00:25.880> 50

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
rate of a conventional oil by about 50

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.179 
rate of a conventional oil by about 50
percent<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:26.630> if<00:00:27.140> you<00:00:27.289> if<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.830> take<00:00:27.980> them

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
percent so if you if you take them

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.279 
percent so if you if you take them
they'll<00:00:28.310> dry<00:00:28.490> in<00:00:28.550> about<00:00:28.760> 2<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.240> 12<00:00:29.630> days<00:00:29.810> oils

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
they'll dry in about 2 to 12 days oils

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.200 
they'll dry in about 2 to 12 days oils
normally<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.130> that'll<00:00:31.340> take<00:00:31.550> that<00:00:31.759> time<00:00:32.000> down

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
normally and that'll take that time down

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.299 
normally and that'll take that time down
to<00:00:32.239> about<00:00:32.570> 1<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:33.019> 6<00:00:33.290> days<00:00:33.590> depending<00:00:33.920> on<00:00:34.220> upon

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
to about 1 to 6 days depending on upon

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.829 
to about 1 to 6 days depending on upon
the<00:00:34.580> pigment<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.089> you<00:00:35.480> have<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.690> remember

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
the pigment and you have to remember

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.569 
the pigment and you have to remember
that's<00:00:36.019> touch<00:00:36.350> dry<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:36.950> you'd<00:00:37.070> still<00:00:37.309> want<00:00:37.550> to

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
that's touch dry so you'd still want to

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.010 
that's touch dry so you'd still want to
wait<00:00:37.790> about<00:00:38.000> six<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.570> twelve<00:00:38.809> months

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
wait about six to twelve months

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.900 
wait about six to twelve months
depending<00:00:39.469> upon<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.010> thickness<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.610> your

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
depending upon the thickness of your

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.430 
depending upon the thickness of your
paint<00:00:41.270> later<00:00:41.450> before<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.930> put<00:00:42.110> that<00:00:42.140> final

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
paint later before you put that final

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.590 
paint later before you put that final
varnish<00:00:42.860> on<00:00:43.070> liquid<00:00:43.850> originally<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
varnish on liquid originally is the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.590 
varnish on liquid originally is the
first<00:00:44.989> liquid<00:00:45.469> produced<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:47.300> can<00:00:47.360> see

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
first liquid produced and you can see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.689 
first liquid produced and you can see
that<00:00:47.719> it's<00:00:47.840> quite<00:00:48.050> fluid<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.710> what<00:00:49.489> I'm<00:00:49.579> going

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
that it's quite fluid and what I'm going

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.979 
that it's quite fluid and what I'm going
to<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:49.969> I'm<00:00:50.030> going<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.180> take<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.360> proportion

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
to do is I'm going to take a proportion

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.150 
to do is I'm going to take a proportion
of<00:00:51.230> about<00:00:51.770> 2<00:00:52.250> parts<00:00:52.699> of<00:00:52.879> oil<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:54.620> one<00:00:55.129> part

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
of about 2 parts of oil to one part

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160 
of about 2 parts of oil to one part
liquid<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:56.480> that's<00:00:56.660> going<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.870> do<00:00:57.050> is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
liquid and what that's going to do is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.900 
liquid and what that's going to do is
it's<00:00:57.320> going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.469> reduce<00:00:57.800> its<00:00:58.010> consistency<00:00:58.699> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's going to reduce its consistency and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.939 
it's going to reduce its consistency and
look<00:00:59.329> how<00:00:59.449> fluid<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.050> gets<00:01:00.320> gets<00:01:00.559> nice<00:01:00.739> and

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
look how fluid that gets gets nice and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.970 
look how fluid that gets gets nice and
fluid<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.460> very<00:01:01.699> very<00:01:01.879> rich<00:01:02.120> color<00:01:02.980> improves

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
fluid it's very very rich color improves

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.210 
fluid it's very very rich color improves
the<00:01:04.160> flow<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:06.170> will<00:01:06.259> also<00:01:06.440> increase<00:01:06.770> film

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the flow it will also increase film

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.089 
the flow it will also increase film
durability<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.990> when<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> apply<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.649> onto<00:01:10.009> the

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:10.099 
durability so when I apply it onto the

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.180 
durability so when I apply it onto the
canvas<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:10.700> gonna<00:01:10.819> make<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.270> more<00:01:11.780> durable

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
canvas it's gonna make it more durable

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.800 
canvas it's gonna make it more durable
adhere<00:01:13.190> even<00:01:13.459> better

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
adhere even better

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.050 
adhere even better
increase<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.959> flexibility<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.920> give<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.970> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
increase the flexibility and give it a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.400 
increase the flexibility and give it a
semi<00:01:17.830> semi-gloss<00:01:18.830> finish<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.660> it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.169 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it
would<00:01:21.530> be<00:01:21.649> similar<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.069> we're<00:01:22.610> dealing<00:01:23.030> with

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
would be similar to we're dealing with

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.449 
would be similar to we're dealing with
drying<00:01:23.929> oils<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.649> would<00:01:24.920> be<00:01:24.979> similar<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
drying oils it would be similar to a

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.889 
drying oils it would be similar to a
linseed<00:01:25.940> oil<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:26.300> have<00:01:26.420> all<00:01:26.539> those<00:01:26.660> great

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
linseed oil but have all those great

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.400 
linseed oil but have all those great
properties<00:01:27.440> but<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.649> would<00:01:27.830> dry<00:01:28.069> faster<00:01:29.410> this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
properties but it would dry faster this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.020 
properties but it would dry faster this
painting<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.830> used<00:01:31.039> liquid<00:01:31.250> original<00:01:31.819> because

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
painting I used liquid original because

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.760 
painting I used liquid original because
I<00:01:32.090> want<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.270> get<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> paint<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.810> fall<00:01:33.110> more<00:01:33.410> oil

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
I want to get the paint to fall more oil

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.650 
I want to get the paint to fall more oil
paint<00:01:34.099> out<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.459> tube<00:01:34.670> can<00:01:34.880> be<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> bit<00:01:35.270> short

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
paint out of the tube can be a bit short

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.809 
paint out of the tube can be a bit short
of<00:01:35.810> sort<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.170> stiff<00:01:36.380> consistency<00:01:36.610> this<00:01:37.610> was

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
of sort of a stiff consistency this was

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.910 
of sort of a stiff consistency this was
done<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.030> location<00:01:38.929> and<00:01:39.170> what<00:01:39.349> I<00:01:39.380> wanted<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:39.800> do

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
done on location and what I wanted to do

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.609 
done on location and what I wanted to do
is<00:01:40.280> work<00:01:40.610> very<00:01:40.940> quickly<00:01:41.170> from<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.319> live

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
is work very quickly from this live

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.550 
is work very quickly from this live
setting<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.340> work<00:01:44.000> went<00:01:44.330> into<00:01:44.479> wet<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
setting and work went into wet so it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.380 
setting and work went into wet so it
took<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:46.009> original<00:01:46.399> stiff<00:01:46.610> consistency<00:01:46.759> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
took that original stiff consistency and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.999 
took that original stiff consistency and
loosen<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.780> up<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.200> can<00:01:48.380> really<00:01:48.560> move<00:01:48.800> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
loosen that up so I can really move the

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.979 
loosen that up so I can really move the
paint<00:01:49.220> around<00:01:49.459> quickly<00:01:49.849> get<00:01:50.569> these<00:01:50.750> very

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:50.989 
paint around quickly get these very

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.109 
paint around quickly get these very
simple<00:01:51.229> abstracted<00:01:52.009> shapes<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.580> get<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
simple abstracted shapes and get the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.529 
simple abstracted shapes and get the
desired<00:01:53.420> effect<00:01:53.569> that<00:01:53.959> I<00:01:54.050> wanted<00:01:55.330> liquid<00:01:56.330> fine

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
desired effect that I wanted liquid fine

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.830 
desired effect that I wanted liquid fine

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
detail as the name suggests is for fine

detail as the name suggests is for fine
detail<00:02:00.380> work<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:01.009> it's<00:02:01.220> more<00:02:01.459> fluid<00:02:01.910> than

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
detail work and it's more fluid than

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.359 
detail work and it's more fluid than
liquid<00:02:02.690> original<00:02:03.170> quite<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.860> bit<00:02:04.039> more<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.310> can

liquid original quite a bit more you can

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.309 
liquid original quite a bit more you can
see<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.819> and<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.479> going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.989> increase

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
see that and it's going to increase

transparency it's going to dry to a
gloss<00:02:08.599> finish<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.259> it'll<00:02:10.160> level<00:02:10.520> your<00:02:10.700> brush

detail<00:02:32.269> was<00:02:32.450> my<00:02:32.569> medium<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.049> choice<00:02:33.079> for<00:02:33.530> this

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
detail was my medium of choice for this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.199 
detail was my medium of choice for this
painting<00:02:34.040> because<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.609> both<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.939> small

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
painting because it's both a small

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.000 
painting because it's both a small
painting<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.750> technically<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.799> tight

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
painting and technically it's a tight

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.770 
painting and technically it's a tight
painting<00:02:37.459> meaning<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.239> had<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> lot<00:02:38.629> of

painting meaning that I had a lot of
little<00:02:39.019> tiny<00:02:39.260> fine<00:02:39.950> details<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> wanted

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
little tiny fine details that I wanted

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.459 
little tiny fine details that I wanted
to<00:02:41.030> get<00:02:41.239> particularly<00:02:41.599> in<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> upper<00:02:42.139> part<00:02:42.409> of

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
to get particularly in the upper part of

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.619 
to get particularly in the upper part of
the<00:02:42.530> bag<00:02:42.709> also<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.519> had<00:02:43.639> a<00:02:43.700> lot<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:43.879> glazing<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
the bag also I had a lot of glazing that

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.030 
the bag also I had a lot of glazing that
I<00:02:44.689> wanted<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.049> do<00:02:45.169> with<00:02:45.469> the<00:02:45.590> pair<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:45.889> your

I wanted to do with the pair of your
glazing<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.519> colors<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.900> liquid<00:02:48.169> fine

glazing of colors and the liquid fine

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.619 
glazing of colors and the liquid fine
detail<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.739> ideal<00:02:49.189> for<00:02:49.489> speeding<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.389> drying

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
detail is ideal for speeding the drying

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.970 
detail is ideal for speeding the drying
rate<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.079> being<00:02:51.230> able<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.439> do<00:02:51.620> several

glazing layers liquid white gel is a gel
medium<00:02:55.189> so<00:02:55.849> I'm<00:02:55.939> actually<00:02:56.000> gonna<00:02:56.209> use<00:02:56.389> a

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
medium so I'm actually gonna use a

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.119 
medium so I'm actually gonna use a
palette<00:02:56.780> knife<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:57.079> get<00:02:57.230> some<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.919> of<00:02:58.069> a

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
palette knife to get some out of a

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.050 
palette knife to get some out of a
bottle<00:02:58.459> right<00:02:58.549> there<00:02:58.699> and<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:58.879> see<00:02:59.030> very

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
bottle right there and you can see very

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.080 
bottle right there and you can see very
easily<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.780> it's<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> lot<00:03:00.139> thicker<00:03:01.040> than<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
easily that it's a lot thicker than the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.490 
easily that it's a lot thicker than the
other<00:03:02.299> two<00:03:02.540> mediums<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.139> showed<00:03:03.319> you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
other two mediums that I just showed you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.020 
other two mediums that I just showed you
and<00:03:03.680> I'm<00:03:03.769> gonna<00:03:03.859> take<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.099> some<00:03:04.609> paint<00:03:04.849> right

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
and I'm gonna take a some paint right

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.420 
and I'm gonna take a some paint right
here<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.719> mix<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.199> in<00:03:06.319> with<00:03:06.469> this<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.949> it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
here and mix it in with this and it's

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.429 
here and mix it in with this and it's
what<00:03:07.579> we'd<00:03:07.699> call<00:03:07.879> thixotropic<00:03:08.269> which<00:03:09.019> is

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
what we'd call thixotropic which is

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.409 
what we'd call thixotropic which is
really<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.159> a<00:03:10.370> big<00:03:10.549> word<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:11.090> saying<00:03:11.209> that

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
really just a big word for saying that

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.809 
really just a big word for saying that
it<00:03:11.510> starts<00:03:11.870> out<00:03:12.049> very<00:03:12.109> gel<00:03:12.709> light<00:03:12.949> but<00:03:13.219> as<00:03:13.639> I

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
it starts out very gel light but as I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.819 
it starts out very gel light but as I
push<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.209> around<00:03:14.449> and<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.840> manipulate<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.500> here

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
push it around and I manipulate it here

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.709 
push it around and I manipulate it here
it<00:03:16.099> starts<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> become<00:03:16.519> much<00:03:17.000> much<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:17.329> fluid

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:17.719 
it starts to become much much more fluid

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.819 
it starts to become much much more fluid
and<00:03:18.310> that's<00:03:19.310> kind<00:03:19.639> of<00:03:19.760> nice<00:03:20.000> because<00:03:20.689> when<00:03:21.680> I'm

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
and that's kind of nice because when I'm

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.999 
and that's kind of nice because when I'm
brushing<00:03:22.189> it<00:03:22.519> out<00:03:22.669> and<00:03:23.169> I<00:03:24.169> have<00:03:24.409> my<00:03:24.439> canvas

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:25.009 
brushing it out and I have my canvas

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.789 
brushing it out and I have my canvas
vertically<00:03:25.639> what<00:03:26.479> will<00:03:26.659> happen<00:03:27.079> is<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.620> won't

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
vertically what will happen is it won't

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.339 
vertically what will happen is it won't
drip<00:03:28.099> down<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.370> surface<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.569> can<00:03:29.930> take<00:03:30.139> this

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
drip down the surface so I can take this

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.550 
drip down the surface so I can take this
here<00:03:30.650> brush<00:03:31.189> out<00:03:31.370> some<00:03:31.549> beautiful<00:03:31.669> marks<00:03:32.239> here

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
here brush out some beautiful marks here

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.379 
here brush out some beautiful marks here
and<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.769> get<00:03:33.889> into<00:03:34.129> a<00:03:34.159> lot<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.400> blending<00:03:35.239> and

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
and I can get into a lot of blending and

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.479 
and I can get into a lot of blending and
glazing<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.169> it'll<00:03:36.680> dry<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:36.919> a<00:03:37.069> very<00:03:37.310> nice

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
glazing and it'll dry to a very nice

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.039 
glazing and it'll dry to a very nice
gloss<00:03:37.790> finish<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.569> other<00:03:38.750> thing<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.989> should

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
gloss finish the other thing I should

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.619 
gloss finish the other thing I should
mention<00:03:39.169> as<00:03:39.650> well<00:03:39.889> is<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:41.120> liquid

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
mention as well is that the liquid

bottles<00:03:43.759> which<00:03:44.509> is<00:03:44.629> great<00:03:44.870> particularly<00:03:45.319> for

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
bottles which is great particularly for

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.860 
bottles which is great particularly for
colleges<00:03:45.949> where<00:03:46.939> they<00:03:47.030> don't<00:03:47.180> want<00:03:47.299> breakage

Lichtman white gel is similar to liquid
fine<00:03:54.349> detail<00:03:54.889> but<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:56.269> obviously<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.049> gel

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
fine detail but it's obviously a gel

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.080 
fine detail but it's obviously a gel
like<00:03:57.739> consistency<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.669> that's<00:03:58.790> nice<00:03:59.060> because

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
like consistency and that's nice because

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.179 
like consistency and that's nice because
I<00:03:59.389> have<00:03:59.509> so<00:03:59.719> many<00:03:59.810> subtle<00:04:00.169> passages<00:04:00.919> in<00:04:01.069> this

portrait of different colors that I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.080 
portrait of different colors that I

wanted to blend wet into wet and the gel

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.360 
wanted to blend wet into wet and the gel
like<00:04:05.269> consistency<00:04:05.419> keeps<00:04:06.259> it<00:04:06.439> from<00:04:06.709> running

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370

working liquid impasto has a very stiff

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.909 
working liquid impasto has a very stiff
consistency<00:04:11.629> which<00:04:12.199> is<00:04:12.259> why<00:04:12.409> it<00:04:12.469> comes<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:12.859> a

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
consistency which is why it comes in a

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.279 
consistency which is why it comes in a
tube<00:04:13.129> so<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.430> can<00:04:13.549> be<00:04:13.639> squeezed<00:04:13.969> out<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.449> it'll

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:15.289 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.229 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll
retain<00:04:15.530> its<00:04:15.739> texture<00:04:16.219> and<00:04:16.340> its<00:04:16.639> brush<00:04:16.940> strokes

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
retain its texture and its brush strokes

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.879 
retain its texture and its brush strokes
as<00:04:17.419> well<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.169> brush<00:04:18.380> strokes<00:04:18.650> will

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
as well and the brush strokes will

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.819 
as well and the brush strokes will
retain<00:04:19.159> these<00:04:19.940> crisp<00:04:20.389> high<00:04:20.719> peaks<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.680> can

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
retain these crisp high peaks so I can

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.519 
retain these crisp high peaks so I can
take<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.310> take<00:04:22.909> some<00:04:22.940> paint<00:04:23.300> here<00:04:23.419> some<00:04:24.320> color

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:24.529 
take up take some paint here some color

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.060 
take up take some paint here some color
and<00:04:25.300> mix<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.479> right<00:04:26.779> into<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.349> you<00:04:27.800> can<00:04:27.919> see

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
and mix that right into it you can see

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.020 
and mix that right into it you can see
already<00:04:28.219> how<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.729> had

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
already how that had

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.510 
already how that had
volume<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.720> paint<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:31.010> also<00:04:31.340> stay

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
volume to the paint and it also stay

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.850 
volume to the paint and it also stay
workable<00:04:32.030> for<00:04:32.330> several<00:04:32.840> hours<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.440> what's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
workable for several hours but what's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.070 
workable for several hours but what's
amazing<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.490> me<00:04:34.520> about<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:35.930> can

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
amazing to me about it is that you can

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.010 
amazing to me about it is that you can
see<00:04:36.350> how<00:04:36.920> very<00:04:37.160> very<00:04:37.400> thick<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:37.940> yet<00:04:38.750> it'll

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
see how very very thick it is yet it'll

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.540 
see how very very thick it is yet it'll
start<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.320> set<00:04:39.560> up<00:04:39.710> within<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:40.790> day<00:04:40.970> or<00:04:41.000> so

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
start to set up within a day or so

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.800 
start to set up within a day or so
liquid<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.670> pasta<00:04:43.970> is<00:04:44.090> great<00:04:44.390> when<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.690> want

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
liquid and pasta is great when you want

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.840 
liquid and pasta is great when you want
to<00:04:44.930> achieve<00:04:45.020> thick<00:04:45.740> rich<00:04:45.980> impasto<00:04:46.580> brush

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
to achieve thick rich impasto brush

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.440 
to achieve thick rich impasto brush
marks<00:04:47.210> they<00:04:47.390> keep<00:04:47.570> their<00:04:47.720> crisp<00:04:47.990> texture

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.330 

liquid<00:04:53.450> olio<00:04:53.690> pasta<00:04:54.260> also<00:04:54.680> comes<00:04:54.890> in<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.130> tube

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
liquid olio pasta also comes in a tube

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.340 
liquid olio pasta also comes in a tube
and<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.580> looks<00:04:55.790> similar<00:04:56.180> however<00:04:57.140> the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
and it looks similar however the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.750 
and it looks similar however the
difference<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.920> that<00:04:58.160> it's<00:04:58.280> going<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.550> drive

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
difference is that it's going to drive

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.600 
difference is that it's going to drive
to<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.910> semi<00:04:59.210> matte<00:04:59.510> finish<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:01.040> I'll<00:05:01.190> mix<00:05:01.400> in

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
to a semi matte finish and I'll mix in

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.700 
to a semi matte finish and I'll mix in
the<00:05:01.730> color<00:05:01.940> here<00:05:02.180> again<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.450> little<00:05:02.630> bit<00:05:02.870> and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
the color here again a little bit and

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.440 
the color here again a little bit and
that's<00:05:03.860> different<00:05:04.340> than<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.910> other<00:05:05.000> liquid

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
that's different than the other liquid

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.480 
that's different than the other liquid
medium<00:05:05.780> it's<00:05:06.080> gonna<00:05:06.200> dry<00:05:06.440> more<00:05:06.740> quickly<00:05:06.770> and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
medium it's gonna dry more quickly and

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.540 
medium it's gonna dry more quickly and
it's<00:05:08.030> gonna<00:05:08.150> thicken<00:05:08.420> rapidly<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.550> the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
it's gonna thicken rapidly and the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.070 
it's gonna thicken rapidly and the
brushstrokes<00:05:12.790> although<00:05:13.790> very<00:05:14.060> thick<00:05:14.510> will

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
brushstrokes although very thick will

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.410 
brushstrokes although very thick will
level<00:05:15.440> out<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:16.400> that's<00:05:16.550> different<00:05:16.910> than<00:05:17.210> the

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
level out and that's different than the

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.720 
level out and that's different than the
liquid<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.230> pasta<00:05:18.740> whereas<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.310> liquid<00:05:19.670> and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
liquid and pasta whereas the liquid and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.780 
liquid and pasta whereas the liquid and
pasta<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.570> gonna<00:05:20.840> retain<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.440> crisp<00:05:21.860> high

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
pasta is gonna retain the crisp high

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.360 
pasta is gonna retain the crisp high
peaks<00:05:23.320> they<00:05:24.320> look<00:05:24.440> an<00:05:24.560> oligo<00:05:24.830> pasta<00:05:25.250> will

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
peaks they look an oligo pasta will

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.180 
peaks they look an oligo pasta will
level<00:05:25.670> out<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.820> bit<00:05:26.090> more<00:05:26.890> so<00:05:27.890> have<00:05:28.070> this

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
level out a bit more so have this

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.470 
level out a bit more so have this
beautiful<00:05:28.550> thick<00:05:29.440> texture<00:05:31.090> liquid<00:05:32.090> only<00:05:32.360> old

beautiful thick texture liquid only old

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.450 
beautiful thick texture liquid only old
pasta<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:33.140> similar<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.620> liquid<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:33.980> pasta<00:05:34.430> and

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
pasta is similar to liquid and pasta and

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430 
pasta is similar to liquid and pasta and
that'll<00:05:34.910> leave<00:05:35.120> very<00:05:35.390> thick<00:05:35.720> brush<00:05:36.050> strokes

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
that'll leave very thick brush strokes

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.220 
that'll leave very thick brush strokes
very<00:05:37.190> nice<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.610> pasta<00:05:37.970> brush<00:05:38.180> strokes<00:05:38.450> except

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
very nice and pasta brush strokes except

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.440 
very nice and pasta brush strokes except
they<00:05:39.650> won't<00:05:39.890> dry<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.430> crisp<00:05:40.880> edge<00:05:41.150> they'll

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
they won't dry to the crisp edge they'll

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.390 
they won't dry to the crisp edge they'll
sort<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.750> level<00:05:42.050> out<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.230> have<00:05:42.590> more<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:43.220> a

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
sort of level out and have more of a

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.220 
sort of level out and have more of a
rounded<00:05:43.850> softer<00:05:44.450> feeling<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:44.990> when<00:05:45.110> they're

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
rounded softer feeling so when they're

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.840 
rounded softer feeling so when they're
at<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.350> end<00:05:45.380> of<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:45.680> painting<00:05:46.100> like<00:05:46.280> this<00:05:46.310> and

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
at the end of a painting like this and

you want to develop big thick areas and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.730 
you want to develop big thick areas and
over<00:05:50.300> paint<00:05:50.720> that's<00:05:50.990> a<00:05:51.050> really<00:05:51.380> nice<00:05:51.470> choice

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
over paint that's a really nice choice

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.030 
over paint that's a really nice choice
for<00:05:52.010> doing<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:53.050> so<00:05:54.050> remember<00:05:54.410> with<00:05:54.560> all<00:05:54.830> the

for doing so so remember with all the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.490 
for doing so so remember with all the
liquid<00:05:55.340> mediums<00:05:55.730> you<00:05:55.940> can<00:05:56.300> mix<00:05:56.510> the<00:05:56.630> paint<00:05:56.900> to

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
liquid mediums you can mix the paint to

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.080 
liquid mediums you can mix the paint to
liquid<00:05:57.830> in<00:05:57.980> a<00:05:58.040> ratio<00:05:58.190> of<00:05:58.340> about<00:05:58.430> two<00:05:58.730> to<00:05:58.910> one

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
liquid in a ratio of about two to one

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.520 
liquid in a ratio of about two to one
and<00:05:59.330> that<00:05:59.630> allows<00:05:59.900> you<00:06:00.140> to<00:06:00.230> change<00:06:00.380> the

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
and that allows you to change the

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.470 
and that allows you to change the
consistency<00:06:00.770> which<00:06:01.340> is<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> key<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.090> mediums

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
consistency which is the key to mediums

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.420 
consistency which is the key to mediums
nice<00:06:03.050> thing<00:06:03.260> about<00:06:03.290> them<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:03.830> you<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.100> get
