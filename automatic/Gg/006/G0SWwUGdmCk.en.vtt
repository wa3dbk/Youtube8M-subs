like to go to the Viper mode of pinpoint
Doppler<00:05:10.250> radar<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.820> what<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.000> found<00:05:11.390> now<00:05:11.600> along

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
Doppler radar and what I found now along

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.880 
the Hayward and Madison County line
we're<00:05:14.780> seeing<00:05:15.020> what<00:05:15.229> are<00:05:15.350> called<00:05:15.530> shear

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
we're seeing what are called shear

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.920 
we're seeing what are called shear
markers<00:05:16.430> which<00:05:16.640> shows<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.360> potential<00:05:17.750> for

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
markers which shows the potential for

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.990 
markers which shows the potential for
rotation<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:18.830> I'm<00:05:18.919> seeing<00:05:19.220> now<00:05:19.280> also<00:05:19.640> is

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
rotation but what I'm seeing now also is

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.120

very<00:05:27.280> strong<00:05:27.610> rotation<00:05:27.880> as<00:05:28.420> we<00:05:28.780> go<00:05:28.900> back<00:05:29.080> to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200

pinpoint<00:05:29.650> Doppler<00:05:30.250> radar<00:05:30.640> mode<00:05:30.910> we're<00:05:31.420> going

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
pinpoint Doppler radar mode we're going

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.970 
pinpoint Doppler radar mode we're going
to<00:05:31.630> look<00:05:31.780> at<00:05:31.930> what's<00:05:32.080> called<00:05:32.230> storm<00:05:32.560> relative

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
to look at what's called storm relative

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.010 
to look at what's called storm relative
velocity<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.460> indeed<00:05:33.880> we<00:05:34.030> do<00:05:34.270> see<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.750> little

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
velocity and indeed we do see a little

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.070 
velocity and indeed we do see a little
bit<00:05:35.170> of<00:05:35.230> a<00:05:35.380> couplet<00:05:35.860> right<00:05:36.100> here<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.550> read

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
bit of a couplet right here this read

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.720 
bit of a couplet right here this read
against<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.380> green<00:05:38.740> again<00:05:39.130> it's<00:05:39.250> moving<00:05:39.610> off

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
against this green again it's moving off

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.210 
against this green again it's moving off
to<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:39.940> east<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.630> about<00:05:40.810> 70<00:05:41.440> miles<00:05:41.680> an<00:05:42.010> hour

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
to the east and about 70 miles an hour

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.830 
to the east and about 70 miles an hour
so<00:05:42.490> what<00:05:42.580> I'm<00:05:42.700> going<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.880> do<00:05:43.060> is<00:05:43.240> actually

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
so what I'm going to do is actually

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.080 
so what I'm going to do is actually
track<00:05:44.590> from<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:44.890> area<00:05:45.490> where<00:05:45.640> we<00:05:45.760> see<00:05:45.970> that

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
track from that area where we see that

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.050 
track from that area where we see that
couplet<00:05:46.570> right<00:05:46.780> in<00:05:47.050> here<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:47.980> tell<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:48.970> what

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
couplet right in here I tell you what

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.130 
couplet right in here I tell you what
we're<00:05:49.180> gonna<00:05:49.270> have<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.540> go<00:05:49.660> out<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.870> that<00:05:49.990> let's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
we're gonna have to go out of that let's

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.780 
we're gonna have to go out of that let's
go<00:05:50.230> to<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.440> Viper<00:05:50.650> motive<00:05:51.040> pinpoint<00:05:51.430> Doppler

we're<00:05:56.680> seeing<00:05:56.920> on<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.250> time-lapse<00:05:57.790> here<00:05:58.090> is

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
we're seeing on the time-lapse here is

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.350 
we're seeing on the time-lapse here is
it's<00:05:58.810> moving<00:05:59.170> very<00:05:59.380> quickly<00:06:00.060> right<00:06:01.060> through

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
it's moving very quickly right through

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.150 
it's moving very quickly right through
here<00:06:01.630> this<00:06:01.810> is<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.020> area<00:06:02.350> of<00:06:02.530> concern<00:06:02.920> to<00:06:03.070> me

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
here this is the area of concern to me

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.130 
here this is the area of concern to me
back<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.490> out<00:06:03.580> just<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.300> little<00:06:04.330> bit<00:06:04.750> this<00:06:05.020> is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
back it out just a little bit this is

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.080 
back it out just a little bit this is
going<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.320> be<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.530> Mercer<00:06:05.980> area<00:06:06.370> Tim<00:06:06.820> let<00:06:07.000> me

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
going to be the Mercer area Tim let me

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.940 
going to be the Mercer area Tim let me
point<00:06:07.240> out<00:06:07.450> -<00:06:07.630> in<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:07.840> Viper<00:06:08.230> mode<00:06:08.440> this<00:06:08.710> runs

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
point out - in the Viper mode this runs

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.730 
point out - in the Viper mode this runs
a<00:06:09.040> couple<00:06:09.310> of<00:06:09.370> minutes<00:06:09.610> behind<00:06:10.000> our<00:06:10.270> live<00:06:10.740> mode

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
a couple of minutes behind our live mode

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.070 
a couple of minutes behind our live mode
and<00:06:12.040> so<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:13.090> thing<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.480> is<00:06:13.690> going<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:13.960> be

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
and so that thing is is going to be

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.680 
and so that thing is is going to be
approaching<00:06:14.680> bemis<00:06:15.130> and<00:06:15.340> just<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:16.390> south

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
approaching bemis and just to the south

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.720 
approaching bemis and just to the south
of<00:06:16.900> bemis<00:06:17.260> just<00:06:17.530> in<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.740> next<00:06:18.070> few<00:06:18.550> minutes

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
of bemis just in the next few minutes

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.400 
of bemis just in the next few minutes
the<00:06:19.540> area<00:06:19.810> where<00:06:19.990> we're<00:06:20.140> getting<00:06:20.230> the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
the area where we're getting the

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.800 
the area where we're getting the
strongest<00:06:20.980> indication<00:06:21.550> of<00:06:21.640> rotation<00:06:22.240> as<00:06:22.360> I

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
strongest indication of rotation as I

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.200 
strongest indication of rotation as I
said<00:06:23.050> just<00:06:23.080> a<00:06:23.350> few<00:06:23.530> moments<00:06:23.620> ago<00:06:23.890> Bemis<00:06:24.550> very

said just a few moments ago Bemis very
very<00:06:25.720> hard<00:06:26.080> hit<00:06:26.320> I<00:06:26.560> went<00:06:27.400> through<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.360> looked

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
very hard hit I went through and looked

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.600 
very hard hit I went through and looked
at<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:28.870> damage<00:06:29.140> about<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:29.860> week<00:06:30.130> after<00:06:30.490> the

at that damage about a week after the
tornado<00:06:31.000> hit<00:06:31.240> there<00:06:31.450> a<00:06:31.480> couple<00:06:31.780> of<00:06:31.840> years<00:06:31.960> ago

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
tornado hit there a couple of years ago

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.160 
tornado hit there a couple of years ago
and<00:06:32.500> it<00:06:32.920> was<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.280> was<00:06:33.310> pretty<00:06:33.580> amazing<00:06:34.210> what<00:06:35.050> we
