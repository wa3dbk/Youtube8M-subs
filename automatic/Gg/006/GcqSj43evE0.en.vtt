your p-wave and s-wave curves straight
you<00:01:22.470> notice<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.670> closer<00:01:24.180> together<00:01:24.479> they

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you notice that the closer together they

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
you notice that the closer together they
are<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.290> smaller<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.979> lag<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.090> farther

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are the smaller the lag time the farther

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
are the smaller the lag time the farther
apart<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.380> bigger<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> lag<00:01:28.950> time

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
apart they get the bigger the lag time

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
apart they get the bigger the lag time
and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> farther<00:01:30.060> away<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.570> waves<00:01:30.810> are

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and the farther away those waves are

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
and the farther away those waves are
going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> epicenter<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.820> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to be from the epicenter so what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.190 
going to be from the epicenter so what
happens<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> understand

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
happens here is you have to understand

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
happens here is you have to understand
the<00:01:34.290> p-wave<00:01:34.650> travel<00:01:35.009> faster<00:01:35.369> than<00:01:35.400> S<00:01:35.640> waves<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the p-wave travel faster than S waves so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
the p-wave travel faster than S waves so
the<00:01:36.810> faster<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> P<00:01:37.380> wave<00:01:37.560> travels<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the faster the P wave travels again the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
the faster the P wave travels again the
farther<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> travel<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> bigger

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
farther it's going to travel the bigger

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
farther it's going to travel the bigger
the<00:01:40.740> gap<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.610> between<00:01:41.820> your

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the gap you're going to get between your

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.889 
the gap you're going to get between your
P<00:01:42.180> wave<00:01:42.360> arrival<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> s<00:01:43.259> wave<00:01:43.439> arrival<00:01:44.899> so

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
P wave arrival and s wave arrival so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.389 
P wave arrival and s wave arrival so
here's<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.409> couple<00:01:46.560> examples<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.189> how<00:01:47.220> to

here's just a couple examples on how to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.300 
here's just a couple examples on how to

an<00:03:17.690> S<00:03:17.780> wave<00:03:17.989> travel<00:03:18.380> in<00:03:18.440> 16<00:03:18.860> minutes<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.940> again

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
an S wave travel in 16 minutes so again

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.720 
an S wave travel in 16 minutes so again
you<00:03:20.390> want<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.570> look<00:03:20.630> for<00:03:20.870> keywords<00:03:21.350> okay<00:03:22.190> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you want to look for keywords okay you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.160 
you want to look for keywords okay you

minutes is given to you bought over to
your<00:03:28.730> S<00:03:28.910> wave<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.769> follow<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.220> down<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:32.690> tell

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
your S wave you follow it down to tell

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.050 
your S wave you follow it down to tell
me<00:03:33.019> your<00:03:33.140> distance<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.430> would<00:03:34.549> take<00:03:34.670> your<00:03:34.850> s

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
me your distance so we would take your s

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.870 
me your distance so we would take your s
wave<00:03:35.360> in<00:03:35.570> this<00:03:35.660> case<00:03:35.930> 16<00:03:36.920> minutes<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.670> travel

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
wave in this case 16 minutes to travel

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.160 
wave in this case 16 minutes to travel
5,000<00:03:38.690> 400<00:03:39.170> kilometers<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.600> very<00:03:41.959> very

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
5,000 400 kilometers so very very

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.360 
5,000 400 kilometers so very very
important<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> identify<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.130> information

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
to travel 6,000 kilometers what you do

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.160 
to travel 6,000 kilometers what you do
with<00:05:52.670> those<00:05:52.760> times<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.450> subtract<00:05:53.960> them

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
with those times is you subtract them

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.070 
with those times is you subtract them
and<00:05:54.460> once<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:55.610> subtract<00:05:56.060> them<00:05:56.300> you<00:05:56.810> will<00:05:56.930> get

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
and once you subtract them you will get

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.490 
and once you subtract them you will get
a<00:05:57.110> difference<00:05:57.500> of<00:05:57.650> 7<00:05:57.920> minutes<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.430> 40<00:05:58.760> seconds
