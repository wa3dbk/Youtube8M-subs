perfect scene you just can't risk the

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.590 
perfect scene you just can't risk the
tops<00:00:19.039> of<00:00:19.220> these<00:00:19.340> things<00:00:19.730> splitting<00:00:20.300> on<00:00:20.570> a

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
tops of these things splitting on a

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.079 
tops of these things splitting on a
finished<00:00:21.380> guitar<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.609> way<00:00:22.759> to<00:00:22.820> go<00:00:23.060> about

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
finished guitar and the way to go about

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.970 
finished guitar and the way to go about
that<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:23.539> to<00:00:23.869> make<00:00:24.019> sure<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:24.500> they're<00:00:24.710> joined

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
that is to make sure that they're joined

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.179 
that is to make sure that they're joined
together<00:00:25.390> perfectly<00:00:26.769> before<00:00:27.769> they're

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
together perfectly before they're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.429 
together perfectly before they're
laminated<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:28.910> not<00:00:29.390> only<00:00:29.509> that<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:29.929> then<00:00:30.349> you

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
laminated and not only that but then you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.989 
laminated and not only that but then you
give<00:00:30.589> them<00:00:30.740> plenty<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.160> time<00:00:31.339> to<00:00:31.490> cure<00:00:31.789> before

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
give them plenty of time to cure before

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.390 
give them plenty of time to cure before
you<00:00:32.240> do<00:00:32.360> any<00:00:32.540> laminated<00:00:33.079> I've<00:00:34.010> got<00:00:34.250> this

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
you do any laminated I've got this

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.650 
you do any laminated I've got this
really<00:00:34.640> nice<00:00:34.880> edge<00:00:35.150> sander<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.390> it

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
really nice edge sander and so it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.610 
really nice edge sander and so it
simplifies<00:00:39.050> getting<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.770> edges<00:00:40.100> square<00:00:40.969> and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
simplifies getting the edges square and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.040 
simplifies getting the edges square and
ready<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.800> offer<00:00:42.980> up<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.430> each<00:00:43.550> other<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.570> you

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
the other end of this piece there was

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.590 
the other end of this piece there was
one<00:05:38.040> little<00:05:38.160> hole<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.850> like<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.270> beetle

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
one little hole just like the beetle

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.040 
one little hole just like the beetle
front<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.230> so<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.920> gray<00:05:41.450> center<00:05:42.450> piece<00:05:42.690> here

that<00:05:43.080> I've<00:05:43.320> kept<00:05:43.680> in<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.010> book<00:05:44.220> match<00:05:44.460> will

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
that I've kept in the book match will

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.090 
that I've kept in the book match will
match<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.630> color<00:05:45.900> from<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.350> front<00:05:46.650> nicely

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
match the color from the front nicely

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.880 
match the color from the front nicely
the<00:05:47.400> other<00:05:47.670> one<00:05:47.940> we<00:05:48.510> went<00:05:48.690> with<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.260> the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
the other one we went with is the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.860 
the other one we went with is the
bird's-eye<00:05:50.400> maple<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.360> can<00:05:51.570> see<00:05:51.840> that

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
bird's-eye maple and you can see that

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.860 
bird's-eye maple and you can see that
that<00:05:52.260> is<00:05:52.440> just<00:05:52.470> incredible<00:05:53.370> stuff<00:05:54.330> back<00:05:54.600> is

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
that is just incredible stuff back is

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.460 
that is just incredible stuff back is
going<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.140> be<00:05:55.520> really<00:05:56.520> cool<00:05:56.730> looking<00:05:57.350> when<00:05:58.350> you

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
going to be really cool looking when you

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.830 
going to be really cool looking when you
flip<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.860> over<00:05:59.040> it's<00:05:59.700> got<00:05:59.970> all<00:06:00.240> kinds<00:06:00.780> of

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
flip it over it's got all kinds of

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.110 
flip it over it's got all kinds of
defects<00:06:01.350> in<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.070> we<00:06:02.190> have<00:06:02.310> this<00:06:02.490> one<00:06:02.760> hole

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
defects in it and we have this one hole

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.409 
defects in it and we have this one hole
here<00:06:03.720> that<00:06:04.200> we<00:06:04.350> managed<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.770> just<00:06:05.280> miss<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.360> I

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
here that we managed to just miss and I

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.000 
here that we managed to just miss and I
think<00:06:06.720> it's<00:06:06.870> going<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.080> fall<00:06:07.350> just<00:06:07.620> outside

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
think it's going to fall just outside

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.100 
think it's going to fall just outside
the<00:06:08.160> body<00:06:08.370> but<00:06:09.150> it's<00:06:09.300> got<00:06:09.510> such<00:06:09.810> beautiful

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
the body but it's got such beautiful

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.740 
the body but it's got such beautiful
birds<00:06:10.680> eye<00:06:10.950> so<00:06:11.700> when<00:06:11.910> people<00:06:12.090> flip<00:06:12.570> that

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
birds eye so when people flip that

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.040 
birds eye so when people flip that
guitar<00:06:13.140> over<00:06:13.560> its<00:06:13.800> is<00:06:14.700> going<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.030> be<00:06:15.210> kind<00:06:15.870> of

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
guitar over its is going to be kind of

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.770 
guitar over its is going to be kind of
impressive<00:06:16.740> you<00:06:17.130> know<00:06:17.160> hopefully<00:06:17.970> we'll<00:06:18.540> see

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
impressive you know hopefully we'll see
