00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
the side that's going to go on the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.260 
the side that's going to go on the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it because it will show so what I do is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.160 
it because it will show so what I do is
I<00:02:18.700> take<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:20.160> application<00:02:21.160> squeegee<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
I take the application squeegee and I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.610 
I take the application squeegee and I
just<00:02:23.470> kind<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:23.770> rest<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.410> it's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
just kind of rest it on here and so it's

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
just kind of rest it on here and so it's
just<00:02:26.860> kind<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.310> hanging<00:02:27.850> off<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.480> little

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
just kind of hanging off just a little

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.870 
just kind of hanging off just a little
bit<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.270> will<00:02:31.810> take<00:02:32.230> my

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
bit and then what I do is I will take my

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.190 
bit and then what I do is I will take my
8330<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> I'll<00:02:34.480> line<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.720> up<00:02:34.930> at<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
8330 here and I'll line it up at the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.040 
8330 here and I'll line it up at the
very<00:02:35.380> top<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:37.120> I'll<00:02:37.270> kind<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.600> rust<00:02:37.840> my

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
very top and then I'll kind of rust my

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.310 
very top and then I'll kind of rust my
thumb<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> get<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> lined<00:02:40.630> up<00:02:40.810> I'll<00:02:41.020> rush

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
thumb when I get it lined up I'll rush

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.900 
thumb when I get it lined up I'll rush
my<00:02:41.500> thumb<00:02:41.800> here<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.190> top<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.700> I'll<00:02:42.790> just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
my thumb here on the top and I'll just

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.800 
my thumb here on the top and I'll just
kind<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.180> pull<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.570> squeegee<00:02:44.050> out<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:45.810> then

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
kind of pull the squeegee out and then

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.350 
kind of pull the squeegee out and then
as<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.380> see<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.680> applied<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.670> it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
as you can see it's applied now and it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.950 
as you can see it's applied now and it
clanged<00:02:49.660> right<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> screen<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.780> then

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
clanged right to the screen and so then

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.270 
clanged right to the screen and so then
what<00:02:53.140> i<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.530> i<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:53.830> take<00:02:54.130> my

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
what i can do is i can take my

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.920 
what i can do is i can take my
application<00:02:54.970> squeeze<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.840> i<00:02:55.900> can

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
smooth out any of the air bubbles that's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
text that's on the squeegee and so it's

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.250 
text that's on the squeegee and so it's
on<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.880> when<00:03:25.180> I'm<00:03:25.300> very<00:03:25.510> easily<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:25.990> no

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260
