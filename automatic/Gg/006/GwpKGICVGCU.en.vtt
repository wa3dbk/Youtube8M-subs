at the Asus memo pad 7 now this is a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.880 
at the Asus memo pad 7 now this is a
7-inch<00:00:14.940> tablet<00:00:15.509> retailing<00:00:15.960> at<00:00:16.139> under<00:00:16.350> 99

so<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.600> certainly<00:00:21.720> no<00:00:22.080> slouch<00:00:22.380> from<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so it's certainly no slouch from a

for a 5 megapixel shooter around on par
I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> Nvidia<00:01:01.109> shield<00:01:01.320> tablet

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I think with the Nvidia shield tablet

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.299 
I think with the Nvidia shield tablet
camera<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:04.019> say<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.500> running<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.860> intel

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
a 99 pound tablet so we shouldn't expect

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.319 
a 99 pound tablet so we shouldn't expect
lots<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.860> bells<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.220> whistles<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.759> what<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
lots of bells and whistles here what we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.289 
lots of bells and whistles here what we
should<00:01:42.509> expect<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:44.100> quality<00:01:44.610> tablet

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
should expect is a good quality tablet

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
should expect is a good quality tablet
that<00:01:45.810> provide<00:01:46.409> good<00:01:46.829> performance<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that provide good performance at a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.399 
that provide good performance at a
reasonable<00:01:48.450> price

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
reasonable price

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.080 
reasonable price
well<00:01:51.070> that's<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.340> hard<00:01:51.490> way<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:51.969> way

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
well that's the hard way out of the way

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.870 
well that's the hard way out of the way
but<00:01:52.479> what<00:01:52.659> about<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.990> software<00:01:53.439> well<00:01:54.430> just

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
but what about the software well just

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.609 
but what about the software well just
like<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.240> zenfone<00:01:55.450> 4<00:01:55.930> we<00:01:56.079> took<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.289> look<00:01:56.469> at<00:01:56.590> a

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
like the zenfone 4 we took a look at a

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.510 
like the zenfone 4 we took a look at a
couple<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:56.979> months<00:01:57.159> ago

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
couple of months ago

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.340 
couple of months ago
Asus<00:01:57.969> have<00:01:58.119> done<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.299> really<00:01:58.600> good<00:01:58.930> job<00:01:58.990> here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
Asus have done a really good job here

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.319 
Asus have done a really good job here
creating<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.369> software<00:02:00.759> suite<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.240> would

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
creating a software suite you would

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.539 
creating a software suite you would
actually<00:02:01.479> want<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:01.990> use<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.740> addition<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.429> the
