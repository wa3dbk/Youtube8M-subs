talk about today is we're going to talk

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.800 
talk about today is we're going to talk
about<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.639> movement<00:00:15.920> with<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> cell<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.810> you

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
about a movement with a cell and you

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390 
about a movement with a cell and you
talk<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.050> movement<00:00:19.650> we're<00:00:19.740> talking<00:00:20.160> about

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
talk about movement we're talking about

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
talk about movement we're talking about
this<00:00:20.760> outside<00:00:21.090> part<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.260> cell

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this outside part which is the cell

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
this outside part which is the cell
membrane<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> cell<00:00:27.779> membrane<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
membrane and this is cell membrane and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.279 
membrane and this is cell membrane and
we're<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> talk<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.210> things<00:00:31.050> get

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
we're going to talk about how things get

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're going to talk about how things get
in<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> how<00:00:32.009> things<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> cell

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
in and how things get out of the cell

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
in and how things get out of the cell
membrane<00:00:33.120> remember<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.079> said<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
membrane remember we said that this is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
membrane remember we said that this is
selectively<00:00:35.250> permeable<00:00:35.670> um<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.780> certain

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
selectively permeable um so certain

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.479 
selectively permeable um so certain
things<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.440> come<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.739> certain<00:00:38.190> things<00:00:38.309> can

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
things that come in certain things can

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.389 
things that come in certain things can
go<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.329> other<00:00:39.510> things<00:00:39.629> can't<00:00:40.399> travel

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
go out but other things can't travel

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
go out but other things can't travel
something's<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> channel<00:00:42.719> under

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
something's going to channel under

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
something's going to channel under
actually<00:00:43.190> travel<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.610> directions

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
actually travel to directions

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.639 
actually travel to directions
something's<00:00:45.930> can't<00:00:46.170> travel<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> any

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
something's can't travel in any

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.860 
something's can't travel in any
directions<00:00:47.210> here<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.390> let's<00:00:48.780> talk<00:00:48.870> about

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
directions here we go let's talk about

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
directions here we go let's talk about
now<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.260> thing<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> understand<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> there's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
now the thing to understand is there's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
now the thing to understand is there's
going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:53.820> types<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
going to be two types that are going to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to be two types that are going to
talking<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> me<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.309> type

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
talking about there's to me the type

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.680 
talking about there's to me the type
that<00:00:56.670> uses<00:00:56.940> energy<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> type<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that uses energy in the type that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
that uses energy in the type that
doesn't<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.079> energy<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.910> types

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
doesn't use energy now there's two types

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.290 
doesn't use energy now there's two types
that<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.559> not<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> energy<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> cell

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that will not use the energy the cell

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
that will not use the energy the cell
and<00:01:04.229> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.619> showing<00:01:04.799> those<00:01:05.010> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and we're going to be showing those in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.730 
and we're going to be showing those in
the<00:01:05.189> skins<00:01:10.880> there<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> goes<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the skins there it goes here we go so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.649 
the skins there it goes here we go so
the<00:01:14.369> two<00:01:14.850> times<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> deal<00:01:15.509> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the two times we're going to deal with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.420 
the two times we're going to deal with
is<00:01:15.840> we're<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> deal<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> passive

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is we're going to deal with a passive

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:29.990 
is we're going to deal with a passive
transport<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.610> then<00:01:23.610> active<00:01:24.210> transport<00:01:29.000> so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
transport and then active transport so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.789 
transport and then active transport so
number<00:01:30.180> active<00:01:30.659> transport<00:01:31.079> energy<00:01:31.229> pass<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
number active transport energy pass to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
number active transport energy pass to
transport<00:01:32.220> no<00:01:32.400> energy<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.150> fast<00:01:33.329> transport

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
transport no energy and fast transport

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.969 
transport no energy and fast transport
slipped<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.170> another<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
slipped off into another one so you can

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.370 
slipped off into another one so you can
pass<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> transport<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.770 

diffusion<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.979> how<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.030> loans<00:01:45.240> work<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
diffusion and how these loans work is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
diffusion and how these loans work is
here<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.350> cell<00:01:46.590> membrane<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
here you have your cell membrane and you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
here you have your cell membrane and you
have<00:01:47.790> ones<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.060> h2o<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.380> small

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
have ones like h2o these are very small

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020 
have ones like h2o these are very small
molecules<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.700> actually<00:01:50.759> move

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
molecules so they can actually move

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
molecules so they can actually move
freely<00:01:51.540> back<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> forth<00:01:52.829> through<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.520> cell

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
freely back and forth through the cell

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
freely back and forth through the cell
and<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> follow<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.829> fusion

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and they're going to follow the fusion

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.670 
and they're going to follow the fusion
flow<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:56.880> there's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.270> more<00:01:57.299> h2<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
flow so if there's a lot more h2 on this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
flow so if there's a lot more h2 on this
side<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> they're<00:01:59.729> gonna<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.939> able<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> flow

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
side and they're gonna be able to flow

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.330 
side and they're gonna be able to flow
to<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.719> side<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.469> vice<00:02:01.740> versa<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
to that side and if it's vice versa it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
to that side and if it's vice versa it's
going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> pull<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> opposite<00:02:03.360> weight<00:02:03.540> number

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
going to pull the opposite weight number

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.719 
going to pull the opposite weight number
goes<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> area<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.469> high<00:02:04.680> concentration

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
goes from the area of high concentration

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
goes from the area of high concentration
an<00:02:05.729> area<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> low<00:02:06.090> concentration<00:02:06.619> just

it<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.620> let's<00:02:13.770> save<00:02:13.920> me<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.280> sugar

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it was like let's save me we have sugar

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.910 
it was like let's save me we have sugar
and<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.720> needs<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.710> high

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and it needs to get on the high

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.650 
and it needs to get on the high
concentration<00:02:17.580> sugar<00:02:17.850> into<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> low

concentration<00:02:19.290> cell<00:02:19.710> well<00:02:20.490> they<00:02:20.790> can't<00:02:21.060> just

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
concentration cell well they can't just

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.060 
concentration cell well they can't just
bring<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> goal<00:02:21.930> cross<00:02:22.170> they're<00:02:22.560> too<00:02:22.680> big<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
bring the goal cross they're too big so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.760 
bring the goal cross they're too big so
instead<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.000> protein<00:02:24.480> channels

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
instead you have protein channels

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.800 
instead you have protein channels
there's<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.860> protein<00:02:26.610> channel<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.570> like<00:02:27.690> an

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
there's a protein channel I just like an

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
there's a protein channel I just like an

specially designed so only sugar can fit

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.570 
specially designed so only sugar can fit
through<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.800> makes<00:02:34.800> perfect<00:02:34.950> sense<00:02:35.160> i'm<00:02:35.430> sure

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
through it makes perfect sense i'm sure

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.190 
through it makes perfect sense i'm sure
now<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.660> come<00:02:36.750> across<00:02:36.990> other

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
now if you can come across other

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.330 
now if you can come across other
molecules<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.990> even<00:02:40.890> bigger<00:02:41.040> than<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
molecules that are even bigger than that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.960 
molecules that are even bigger than that
and<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:42.060> are<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:42.480> able<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:43.970> not

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and they are not able to actually not

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.090 
and they are not able to actually not
bigger<00:02:45.600> than<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.810> they're<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.620> able<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.980> go

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
through the cell membrane because of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.570 
through the cell membrane because of
this<00:02:48.750> particular<00:02:49.290> problem<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> inside<00:02:50.550> of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
this particular problem on the inside of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.530 
this particular problem on the inside of
the<00:02:50.730> cell<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> high<00:02:51.270> concentration

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the cell you have a high concentration

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.090 
the cell you have a high concentration
and<00:02:52.170> then<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> oxide<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.950> low

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
and then the oxide you have a low

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.860 
and then the oxide you have a low
concentration<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.030> let's<00:02:54.180> give<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.660> much

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
concentration so let's give that much

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.510 
concentration so let's give that much
and<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.620> now<00:02:55.800> actually<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.370> want

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
and so now actually it's going to want

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.480 
and so now actually it's going to want
to<00:02:56.550> fall<00:02:56.760> out<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.270> cell<00:02:57.510> well<00:02:58.440> there's<00:02:59.430> a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
to fall out of this cell well there's a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.250 
to fall out of this cell well there's a
way<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> work<00:03:00.420> against<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.140> take

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
way to work against that you can take

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.750 
way to work against that you can take
another<00:03:01.410> when<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:01.680> protein<00:03:02.130> channels<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
another when these protein channels and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
another when these protein channels and
using<00:03:03.390> energy<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.500> actually<00:03:04.620> use<00:03:04.890> energy<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
using energy to actually use energy to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.310 
using energy to actually use energy to
pull<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.760> inside<00:03:06.210> now<00:03:06.810> when<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
pull that inside now when you get to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.780 
pull that inside now when you get to
high<00:03:07.410> school<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.860> later<00:03:08.010> they're<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.670> to

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
high school and later they're going to

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.490 
high school and later they're going to
go<00:03:08.910> moreover<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:09.810> exactly<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.320> happening

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
go moreover what exactly is happening

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.490 
go moreover what exactly is happening
what<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.130> energy<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.580> being<00:03:11.910> used<00:03:12.500> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
what kind of energy is being used in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.590 
what kind of energy is being used in
order<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.890> pull<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.190> over<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.450> does

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
order to pull that over but what it does

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.300 
order to pull that over but what it does
is<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.750> goes<00:03:15.990> against<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.620> normal<00:03:17.040> diffusion

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is it goes against what normal diffusion

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
is it goes against what normal diffusion
would<00:03:17.610> say<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:17.970> we'd<00:03:18.090> normally<00:03:18.180> again<00:03:18.570> want<00:03:18.810> to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
would say so we'd normally again want to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.810 
would say so we'd normally again want to
go<00:03:18.960> this<00:03:19.110> way<00:03:19.170> well<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.220> goes<00:03:20.370> from<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.610> air<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
go this way well it goes from the air of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.280 
go this way well it goes from the air of
low<00:03:21.000> concentration<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.960> an<00:03:22.020> area<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.230> high

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
like riding down the hill you don't have

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320 
like riding down the hill you don't have
to<00:03:31.350> use<00:03:31.470> any<00:03:31.500> energy<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.240> know

concentration<00:03:38.730> area<00:03:39.540> high<00:03:39.660> concentration

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
concentration area high concentration

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.110 
concentration area high concentration
you<00:03:40.590> actually<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.160> use<00:03:41.190> energy<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
you actually have to use energy and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.810 
you actually have to use energy and
that's<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.170> know<00:03:43.320> using<00:03:44.220> your<00:03:44.430> legs<00:03:44.580> so

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
that's you you know using your legs so

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.580 
that's you you know using your legs so
it's<00:03:44.910> cause<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.450> slide<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.050> panel<00:03:46.410> it's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
it's cause you to slide the panel it's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.250 
it's cause you to slide the panel it's
really<00:03:46.770> terrible<00:03:47.040> oh<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:48.270> press<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.050> again

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
really terrible oh I press that again

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260 
really terrible oh I press that again
and<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:50.100> really<00:03:50.280> want<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.640> because<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.120> takes

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and you really want to because it takes

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.450 
and you really want to because it takes
forever<00:03:51.450> well<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.650> last<00:03:52.770> two<00:03:53.070> things<00:03:53.250> were<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
forever well the last two things were to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.500 
forever well the last two things were to
talk<00:03:53.670> about<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.000> we're<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.240> talk<00:03:54.390> about

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
talk about is we're going to talk about

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.740 
talk about is we're going to talk about
endocytosis<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.770> exocytosis<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:57.210> little

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
endocytosis and exocytosis a little

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.410 
endocytosis and exocytosis a little
preview<00:03:57.930> all<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> way<00:03:58.380> for<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.650> load<00:03:59.420> now

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
preview all the way for this load now

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.540 
preview all the way for this load now
endocytosis<00:04:01.260> remember<00:04:01.740> remember<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.340> word

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
endocytosis remember remember the word

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.120 
endocytosis remember remember the word
endo<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.360> endo<00:04:03.930> simply<00:04:04.320> what<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.560> means<00:04:04.740> is<00:04:04.950> it

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
endo and endo simply what it means is it

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.550 
endo and endo simply what it means is it
means<00:04:05.390> inside<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.230> when<00:04:07.350> we're<00:04:07.470> talking

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
means inside and so when we're talking

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.020 
means inside and so when we're talking
about<00:04:07.680> endocytosis<00:04:08.160> we're<00:04:08.670> talking<00:04:08.970> about

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
about endocytosis we're talking about

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.150 
about endocytosis we're talking about
bringing<00:04:09.420> something<00:04:09.630> inside<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.440> exocytosis

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
bringing something inside in exocytosis

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.270 
bringing something inside in exocytosis
member<00:04:11.580> XO<00:04:11.910> means<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.540> exit<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.920> we're<00:04:14.040> talking

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
member XO means to exit so we're talking

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.890 
member XO means to exit so we're talking
about<00:04:14.340> getting<00:04:14.700> rid<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:14.910> something<00:04:15.180> will<00:04:15.810> you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
about getting rid of something will you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.590 
about getting rid of something will you
come<00:04:16.049> across<00:04:16.290> things<00:04:16.650> oh<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:18.450> let's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
come across things oh now let's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.450 
come across things oh now let's
possessed<00:04:19.170> by<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.350> devil<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:22.650> I'm<00:04:22.979> asking<00:04:23.340> to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
possessed by the devil do I'm asking to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.429 
possessed by the devil do I'm asking to
do

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.270 

when<00:04:28.439> you're<00:04:28.560> dealing<00:04:28.680> with<00:04:28.860> end<00:04:29.159> or

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
when you're dealing with end or

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.399 
when you're dealing with end or
exocytosis<00:04:30.000> you're<00:04:30.599> dealing<00:04:30.870> with<00:04:30.900> particles

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
exocytosis you're dealing with particles

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.670 
exocytosis you're dealing with particles
that<00:04:31.469> are<00:04:31.530> too<00:04:31.800> big<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:33.330> naturally<00:04:33.900> actually

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
that are too big to naturally actually

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.890 
that are too big to naturally actually
go<00:04:34.919> into<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.819> cell<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.569> cell<00:04:36.750> will

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
go into a cell so what the cell will

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.770 
go into a cell so what the cell will
actually<00:04:37.169> do<00:04:37.289> it<00:04:37.680> will<00:04:37.919> adult<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.780> particle

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
actually do it will adult a particle

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.629 
actually do it will adult a particle
that<00:04:39.810> wants<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.199> take<00:04:40.379> in<00:04:40.560> or<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.370> will<00:04:41.460> just

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
that wants to take in or it will just

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.610 
that wants to take in or it will just
push<00:04:41.879> out<00:04:42.150> any<00:04:42.539> particle<00:04:43.110> that's<00:04:43.259> too<00:04:43.439> large

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
push out any particle that's too large

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.649 
push out any particle that's too large
and<00:04:43.800> wants<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.069> kick<00:04:44.250> out<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:45.210> that's<00:04:45.360> pretty

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
and wants to kick out and that's pretty

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.080 
and wants to kick out and that's pretty
much<00:04:45.780> how<00:04:45.960> endo<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.379> exocytosis<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.520> don't

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
much how endo and exocytosis is I don't

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.950 
much how endo and exocytosis is I don't
think<00:04:48.330> I'm<00:04:48.509> going<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.659> get<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:48.900> thing

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
think I'm going to get this thing

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.279 
think I'm going to get this thing
working<00:04:49.349> so<00:04:49.830> hopefully<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.729> definition

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
working so hopefully that definition

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.360 
working so hopefully that definition
gives<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.439> enough<00:04:52.650> it's<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.009> large

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
gives you enough it's just large

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.800 
gives you enough it's just large
particles<00:04:54.000> remember<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.449> not<00:04:54.569> going<00:04:54.659> to<00:04:54.750> be

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
particles remember it's not going to be

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.469 
particles remember it's not going to be
like<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:56.310> size<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.669> sugar<00:04:56.909> molecules<00:04:57.330> it's

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
like the size of sugar molecules it's

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.749 
like the size of sugar molecules it's
much<00:04:57.840> larger<00:04:58.110> than<00:04:58.439> that<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.370> that's<00:04:59.550> why<00:04:59.699> it

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
much larger than that and that's why it

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.159 
much larger than that and that's why it
has<00:04:59.939> to<00:05:00.090> perform<00:05:00.270> let's<00:05:00.689> different<00:05:00.960> types<00:05:01.080> of

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
has to perform let's different types of

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.929 
has to perform let's different types of
psychosis<00:05:03.710> doing<00:05:04.710> what<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:04.889> wanted<00:05:05.189> to<00:05:05.250> do<00:05:05.460> all

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:05.939 
psychosis doing what I wanted to do all

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.149 
psychosis doing what I wanted to do all
right<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.300> that's<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.689> first<00:05:06.870> podcast<00:05:07.229> if<00:05:08.099> you

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
right so that's the first podcast if you

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.230 
right so that's the first podcast if you
have<00:05:08.250> any<00:05:08.370> questions<00:05:08.729> make<00:05:08.789> sure<00:05:08.909> you<00:05:09.090> email

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
have any questions make sure you email

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.269 
have any questions make sure you email
me<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.659> we'll<00:05:10.409> get<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.680> squared<00:05:10.770> away<00:05:10.949> all

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
me and we'll get you squared away all

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.400
