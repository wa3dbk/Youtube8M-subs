even<00:02:57.430> though<00:02:57.610> there's<00:02:57.850> one<00:02:58.140> Gil<00:02:59.140> pack<00:02:59.380> from

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
even though there's one Gil pack from

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.320 
even though there's one Gil pack from
each<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.100> older<00:03:00.340> sets<00:03:00.580> there's<00:03:01.090> still

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
each of the older sets there's still

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.000 
each of the older sets there's still
four<00:03:01.720> dragon's<00:03:02.110> maze<00:03:02.230> boosters<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.860> it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
four dragon's maze boosters so it's

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.140 
four dragon's maze boosters so it's
mostly<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.640> drag<00:03:03.880> space

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
mostly going to be a drag space

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.540 
mostly going to be a drag space
dominated<00:03:04.630> format<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.250> after<00:03:06.250> looking<00:03:06.430> over

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
dominated format and after looking over

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.130

a<00:03:06.820> lot<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> card<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.780> spoilers<00:03:08.080> that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
a lot of the card on the spoilers that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.350 
a lot of the card on the spoilers that
were<00:03:08.290> released<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.739> Monday<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.090> going<00:03:10.300> to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
were released on Monday this is going to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.960 
were released on Monday this is going to
be<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> very<00:03:10.690> slow<00:03:11.230> format<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.100> two<00:03:12.550> things<00:03:12.760> are

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
be a very slow format so two things are

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.240 
be a very slow format so two things are
definitely<00:03:13.150> true<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.200> creatures<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.860> not<00:03:15.070> as

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
definitely true the creatures are not as

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.400 
definitely true the creatures are not as
aggressive<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.820> dragging<00:03:16.030> space<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
aggressive and dragging space and the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.710 
aggressive and dragging space and the
mana<00:03:17.620> fixing<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.160> much<00:03:18.340> better<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.630> are

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
mana fixing is much better so you are

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.030 
mana fixing is much better so you are
going<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.140> see<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> lot<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.500> people<00:03:20.769> with<00:03:20.860> three

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
going to see a lot of people with three

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.860 
going to see a lot of people with three
colored<00:03:21.310> X<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.150> intended<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.780> know

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
colored X and this is intended you know

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.380 
colored X and this is intended you know
that's<00:03:23.019> why<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.170> get<00:03:23.320> an<00:03:23.410> ally<00:03:23.709> guild<00:03:24.010> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
that's why you get an ally guild and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.100 
that's why you get an ally guild and
everything's<00:03:25.390> going<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> be<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> bit<00:03:25.870> slower

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
everything's going to be a bit slower

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.720 
everything's going to be a bit slower
because<00:03:26.440> even<00:03:27.220> though<00:03:27.310> there's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.549> lot<00:03:27.700> of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
because even though there's a lot of

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.699 
because even though there's a lot of
mana<00:03:27.970> fixing<00:03:28.360> which<00:03:28.510> is<00:03:28.660> good<00:03:28.900> for<00:03:28.930> mana<00:03:29.320> basis

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
mana fixing which is good for mana basis

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.800 
mana fixing which is good for mana basis
you<00:03:30.489> know<00:03:30.519> man<00:03:30.760> affixing<00:03:31.180> cards<00:03:31.540> don't

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
you know man affixing cards don't

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.509 
you know man affixing cards don't
actually<00:03:32.290> move<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.709> game<00:03:32.950> forward<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.430> know

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
actually move the game forward you know

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.210 
actually move the game forward you know
the<00:03:33.640> clues<00:03:34.000> stones<00:03:34.330> or<00:03:34.780> guild<00:03:35.709> gates<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.130> know

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the clues stones or guild gates you know

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.470 
the clues stones or guild gates you know
they<00:03:36.340> come<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.580> plate<00:03:36.730> after<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.239> slowed

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
they come to plate after they slowed

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.449 
they come to plate after they slowed
everything<00:03:37.690> down<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.830> format<00:03:39.100> as<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.280> whole

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
everything down so the format as a whole

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.580 
everything down so the format as a whole
is<00:03:39.700> actually<00:03:39.940> gonna<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.120> much<00:03:40.390> slower<00:03:40.690> much

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
is actually gonna be much slower much

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.320 
is actually gonna be much slower much
slower<00:03:41.769> than<00:03:41.890> even<00:03:42.310> return<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.730> ravnica<00:03:43.120> and

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
slower than even return to ravnica and

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.670 
slower than even return to ravnica and
definitely<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.660> lot<00:03:43.959> slower<00:03:44.110> than<00:03:44.290> gatecrash

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
definitely a lot slower than gatecrash

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.759 
definitely a lot slower than gatecrash
your<00:03:44.830> crush<00:03:45.190> was<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> really<00:03:45.670> fast<00:03:45.880> format<00:03:46.239> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
your crush was a really fast format and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.140 
your crush was a really fast format and
so<00:03:47.769> there<00:03:48.280> are<00:03:48.370> two<00:03:48.519> ways<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.940> go<00:03:49.120> about

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
so there are two ways you can go about

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.690 
so there are two ways you can go about
this<00:03:49.900> attacking<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.620> format<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.400> can<00:03:51.519> go

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
this attacking the format you can go

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.400 
this attacking the format you can go
forward<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.180> guilt<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:52.630> good<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.170> slow

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
forward a guilt that's good in the slow

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.140 
forward a guilt that's good in the slow
game<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:54.370> would<00:03:54.489> be<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> good<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.910> whores

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
game this would be a good like whores

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.660 
game this would be a good like whores
off<00:03:55.360> perhaps<00:03:55.660> with<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> extorts<00:03:57.160> people<00:03:57.430> in

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
off perhaps with a extorts people in

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.610 
off perhaps with a extorts people in
what<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:57.970> long<00:03:58.120> game<00:03:58.299> or<00:03:58.780> selesnya<00:03:59.320> which

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
what is the long game or selesnya which

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.199 
what is the long game or selesnya which
are<00:03:59.860> eventually<00:04:00.220> overwhelms<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.000> with<00:04:01.150> a

gigantic army so I'm actually going to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.960 
gigantic army so I'm actually going to
do<00:04:04.060> something<00:04:04.420> entirely<00:04:04.720> different<00:04:05.190> ok<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.400> am

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
do something entirely different ok I am

do something entirely different ok I am
actually<00:04:07.209> going<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.780> pick<00:04:08.079> Boros<00:04:08.440> well<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.310> mean

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
actually going to pick Boros well I mean

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.160 
actually going to pick Boros well I mean
I'm<00:04:09.820> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.120> for<00:04:10.360> pre-releases<00:04:10.780> just

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
I'm going to for pre-releases just

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.380 
I'm going to for pre-releases just
because<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.410> love<00:04:11.590> magic<00:04:11.739> but<00:04:12.519> for<00:04:13.000> two<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> them

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
because I love magic but for two of them

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.940 
because I love magic but for two of them
I<00:04:13.540> am<00:04:13.660> picking<00:04:13.810> Boros<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.530> reason<00:04:14.769> for<00:04:14.920> that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
I am picking Boros the reason for that

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.099 
I am picking Boros the reason for that
is<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.430> think<00:04:15.820> Borel<00:04:16.359> still<00:04:16.600> has<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.930> best

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
is I think Borel still has the best

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.380 
is I think Borel still has the best
chance<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.620> opening<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:18.190> god<00:04:18.400> pool<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.910> what

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
chance of opening a god pool and what

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.670 
chance of opening a god pool and what
that<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.720> like<00:04:19.900> not<00:04:20.349> only<00:04:20.620> are<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.250> rare

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
that is is like not only are the rare

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.920 
that is is like not only are the rare
in<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.190> boros<00:04:22.460> kilpatt<00:04:22.820> really<00:04:23.060> good<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:23.810> if

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
predictions but you look at the cards it

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.510 
predictions but you look at the cards it
seems<00:05:38.960> about<00:05:39.139> right<00:05:39.199> and<00:05:39.560> there<00:05:40.039> are<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.280> lot<00:05:40.490> of

seems about right and there are a lot of

big<00:05:41.000> booty<00:05:41.479> creatures<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:42.080> mean<00:05:42.320> look<00:05:42.500> at<00:05:42.560> all

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
big booty creatures I mean look at all

big booty creatures I mean look at all
the<00:05:43.039> gatekeepers<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.760> know<00:05:43.880> low-power<00:05:44.570> high

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
the gatekeepers you know low-power high

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.779 
the gatekeepers you know low-power high
toughness<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.620> that's<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.310> pattern<00:05:46.550> that's

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
toughness and that's a pattern that's

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.640 
toughness and that's a pattern that's
very<00:05:47.060> common<00:05:47.270> for<00:05:47.659> the<00:05:47.750> cards<00:05:48.020> in<00:05:48.169> greg's<00:05:48.409> maze

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
very common for the cards in greg's maze

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.129 
very common for the cards in greg's maze
so<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.729> think<00:05:50.000> in<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.300> end<00:05:50.330> up<00:05:50.690> what<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:50.990> want

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
so I think in the end up what you want

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.050 
so I think in the end up what you want
to<00:05:51.199> do<00:05:51.320> is<00:05:51.500> just<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:52.009> know<00:05:52.099> pick<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.699> guilt

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
to do is just you know pick the guilt

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.909 
to do is just you know pick the guilt
that<00:05:53.150> you<00:05:53.240> have<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.570> most<00:05:53.720> fun<00:05:53.930> with<00:05:54.139> because

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
that you have the most fun with because
