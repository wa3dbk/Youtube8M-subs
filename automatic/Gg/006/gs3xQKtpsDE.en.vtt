readers<00:01:42.289> out<00:01:42.649> there<00:01:42.679> online<00:01:43.420> basically<00:01:44.619> this

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
readers out there online basically this

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.910 
readers out there online basically this
device<00:01:46.009> features<00:01:46.549> 3d<00:01:47.060> without<00:01:47.540> glasses<00:01:47.920> so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
device features 3d without glasses so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.230 
device features 3d without glasses so
there's<00:01:49.100> no<00:01:49.220> glasses<00:01:49.460> needed<00:01:49.759> like<00:01:50.030> some<00:01:50.180> of

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
there's no glasses needed like some of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.370 
there's no glasses needed like some of
the<00:01:50.299> other<00:01:50.450> devices<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.869> are<00:01:51.049> being<00:01:51.140> shown

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
the other devices that are being shown

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.289 
the other devices that are being shown
here<00:01:51.619> at<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> show<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.700> what<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:52.850> means<00:01:53.150> is

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
here at the show so what that means is

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.330 
here at the show so what that means is
we<00:01:53.479> use<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.960> technology<00:01:54.530> called<00:01:54.860> parallax

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
we use a technology called parallax

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.670 
we use a technology called parallax
barrier

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
barrier

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.100 
barrier
parallax<00:01:57.220> barrier<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:58.030> essentially<00:01:58.660> you're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
parallax barrier is essentially you're

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.170 
parallax barrier is essentially you're
looking<00:01:59.470> at<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.740> image<00:02:00.010> on<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.730> screen<00:02:00.850> and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
looking at this image on the screen and

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.360 
looking at this image on the screen and
essentially<00:02:02.020> there's<00:02:02.200> two<00:02:02.440> images<00:02:02.710> displayed

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
essentially there's two images displayed

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.250 
essentially there's two images displayed
on<00:02:03.790> screen<00:02:03.820> you're<00:02:04.660> not<00:02:04.780> going<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.960> see<00:02:05.140> them

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
on screen you're not going to see them

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.780 
on screen you're not going to see them
when<00:02:05.380> you're<00:02:05.470> looking<00:02:05.710> straight<00:02:05.920> on<00:02:06.160> right

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
when you're looking straight on right

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.130 
when you're looking straight on right
one<00:02:06.970> image<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.300> going<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.570> hit<00:02:07.690> your<00:02:07.750> left<00:02:07.960> eye

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
one image is going to hit your left eye

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.630 
one image is going to hit your left eye
one<00:02:08.710> image<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.009> going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> hit<00:02:09.310> your<00:02:09.399> right<00:02:09.610> eye

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
one image is going to hit your right eye

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.030 
one image is going to hit your right eye
because<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.200> brain<00:02:11.410> processes<00:02:11.440> that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
because the brain processes that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.800 
because the brain processes that
information<00:02:12.670> giving<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> illusion<00:02:13.630> of

technology so you're going to be able to

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.370 
technology so you're going to be able to
have<00:02:18.459> three<00:02:18.790> dimensions<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.360> 3d<00:02:19.690> you're<00:02:20.230> going

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
have three dimensions of 3d you're going

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.680 
have three dimensions of 3d you're going

shooter type game kind of in the same

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
shooter type game kind of in the same
vein<00:02:54.880> if<00:02:55.030> you're<00:02:55.180> familiar<00:02:55.270> with<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:55.780> halo

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
vein if you're familiar with like halo

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.870 
vein if you're familiar with like halo
and<00:02:56.320> things<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.650> like<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:57.430> space<00:02:57.670> marine

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
and things like that like a space marine

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.220 
and things like that like a space marine
and<00:02:58.270> you're<00:02:58.360> walking<00:02:58.630> around<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:59.080> gun

and again like I said it doesn't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.940 
and again like I said it doesn't
translate<00:03:05.660> well<00:03:05.930> on<00:03:06.230> screen<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.830> can
