I'm not saying I would definitely do it
I'm<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.270> saying<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.930> thinking

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I'm just saying if I was thinking

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
I'm just saying if I was thinking
outside<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.650> box<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> ideas<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> knew

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
outside the box of ideas and if I knew

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.920 
outside the box of ideas and if I knew
Brock<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.110> leaving<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.880> Brock's<00:01:27.210> last

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Brock was leaving so if Brock's last

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.550 
Brock was leaving so if Brock's last
date<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.880> WrestleMania<00:01:29.880> 31<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.290> don't

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
date is WrestleMania 31 and they don't

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
sign him to a new deal or he decides I'm

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.300 
sign him to a new deal or he decides I'm
done<00:01:34.229> I've<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.590> fun<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
done I've had my fun I'm going to go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
done I've had my fun I'm going to go
back<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> UFC<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.079> looks<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.350> he's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
back to UFC and it looks like he's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.999 
back to UFC and it looks like he's
really<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.840> think<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> point

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
really out I think then at that point

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.050 
really out I think then at that point
this<00:01:41.820> idea<00:01:42.240> makes<00:01:42.659> sense<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.520> think<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> would

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this idea makes sense I think it would

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
this idea makes sense I think it would
potentially<00:01:45.840> make<00:01:45.990> sense<00:01:46.320> now<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:47.040> trying

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
to top himself he's just great at what

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.830 
to top himself he's just great at what
he<00:03:42.000> does<00:03:42.299> if<00:03:43.199> Brock<00:03:43.650> stays<00:03:44.329> which<00:03:45.329> is<00:03:45.479> also

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
he does if Brock stays which is also

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.520 
he does if Brock stays which is also
possible<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:47.639> turns<00:03:48.030> him<00:03:48.180> babyface<00:03:48.840> looking

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
possible it turns him babyface looking

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.679 
possible it turns him babyface looking
for<00:03:49.739> revenge<00:03:50.040> kind<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.150> way<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.389> did<00:03:51.569> back

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
for revenge kind of the way it did back

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.229 
for revenge kind of the way it did back
in<00:03:51.750> 2002<00:03:52.560> right<00:03:52.829> Brock<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.669> already<00:03:53.939> starting

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
in 2002 right Brock was already starting

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
in 2002 right Brock was already starting
to<00:03:54.269> get<00:03:54.389> cheered<00:03:54.689> and<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.009> storyline

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
to get cheered and I think the storyline

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.039 
to get cheered and I think the storyline
at<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.639> time<00:03:56.879> was<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.090> Heyman<00:03:57.599> was<00:03:57.719> finding

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
at the time was that Heyman was finding

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.020 
at the time was that Heyman was finding
it<00:03:58.169> more<00:03:58.409> difficult<00:03:58.469> to<00:03:58.979> control<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.609> monster

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it more difficult to control the monster

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.520 
it more difficult to control the monster
he<00:04:00.150> created<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.780> Brock<00:04:00.959> was<00:04:01.199> starting<00:04:01.500> to

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
he created and Brock was starting to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.009 
he created and Brock was starting to
think<00:04:01.829> for<00:04:02.009> himself<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.669> that's<00:04:03.299> when<00:04:03.599> Heyman

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
think for himself and that's when Heyman

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.649 
think for himself and that's when Heyman
knew<00:04:04.259> and<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.189> he<00:04:05.430> plotted<00:04:06.000> against<00:04:06.389> him<00:04:06.449> and

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
knew and so he plotted against him and

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.270 
knew and so he plotted against him and
he<00:04:06.750> went<00:04:06.870> with<00:04:06.989> big<00:04:07.229> show<00:04:07.469> instead<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.159> and

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
he went with big show instead and and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.670 
he went with big show instead and and
then<00:04:08.909> Brock<00:04:09.209> just<00:04:09.419> became<00:04:09.719> full-on<00:04:10.169> badass

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
then Brock just became full-on badass

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.830 
then Brock just became full-on badass
babyface<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.519> think<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> same<00:04:12.479> thing<00:04:12.509> would

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
babyface I think the same thing would

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.569 
babyface I think the same thing would
probably<00:04:13.019> happen<00:04:13.620> here<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.069> then<00:04:14.250> what<00:04:14.489> you

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
probably happen here and then what you

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.189 
probably happen here and then what you
could<00:04:14.759> do<00:04:14.909> is<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.269> could<00:04:15.389> do<00:04:15.509> the<00:04:15.659> deal<00:04:15.870> with

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
could do is you could do the deal with

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.289 
could do is you could do the deal with
Rollins<00:04:16.739> also<00:04:17.370> turning<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.940> feuding<00:04:18.269> with

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
Rollins also turning and feuding with

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.050 
Rollins also turning and feuding with
reigns<00:04:18.659> but<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.259> wouldn't<00:04:20.009> have<00:04:20.159> Rollins<00:04:20.549> win<00:04:20.820> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
reigns but I wouldn't have Rollins win I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
reigns but I wouldn't have Rollins win I
would<00:04:21.659> keep<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.169> belt<00:04:22.380> on<00:04:22.560> Roman<00:04:23.099> reigns<00:04:23.340> for

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
would keep the belt on Roman reigns for

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.399 
would keep the belt on Roman reigns for
a<00:04:23.610> while<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.090> then<00:04:24.300> feud<00:04:24.659> him<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:25.050> Dean

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
a while and then feud him with Dean

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.780 
a while and then feud him with Dean
Ambrose

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
Ambrose

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.640 
Ambrose
the<00:04:26.910> championship<00:04:27.570> at<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.870> point<00:04:28.170> or<00:04:28.440> maybe

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
the championship at that point or maybe

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.400 
the championship at that point or maybe
you<00:04:28.830> revisit<00:04:29.480> reigns<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.750> Brock<00:04:30.900> only<00:04:31.290> with

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
you revisit reigns and Brock only with

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.050 
you revisit reigns and Brock only with
the<00:04:31.530> roles<00:04:31.740> reversed<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:32.340> time<00:04:32.550> Brock<00:04:32.790> being

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
the roles reversed this time Brock being

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.690 
the roles reversed this time Brock being
the<00:04:33.180> babyface<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.840> reigns<00:04:34.020> being<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.350> heel

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
the babyface and reigns being the heel

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.520 
the babyface and reigns being the heel
but<00:04:35.700> in<00:04:35.910> your<00:04:36.030> scenario<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.810> Dave<00:04:36.960> scenario<00:04:37.470> I

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
but in your scenario and Dave scenario I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.430 
but in your scenario and Dave scenario I
do<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.190> real<00:04:38.370> money<00:04:38.700> would<00:04:39.420> be<00:04:39.630> he'll

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
do think the real money would be he'll

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.250 
do think the real money would be he'll
Roman<00:04:40.890> reigns<00:04:41.150> feuding<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.180> babyface<00:04:42.930> Dean

Ambrose<00:04:43.710> for<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.920> championship<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.150> think

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
Ambrose for the championship I I think

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.250 
Ambrose for the championship I I think
that<00:04:45.990> could<00:04:46.770> really<00:04:46.800> be<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.820> feud<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.540> carries

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
that could really be a feud that carries

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.980 
that could really be a feud that carries
the<00:04:49.410> company<00:04:49.970> next<00:04:50.970> year<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:51.420> they<00:04:51.600> wanted<00:04:51.900> to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
the company next year if they wanted to

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.720 
the company next year if they wanted to
go<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.200> that<00:04:52.320> direction<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.010> I'll<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:53.550> leave

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
go in that direction so I'll just leave

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.730 
go in that direction so I'll just leave
it<00:04:53.760> at<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.300> hate<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.170> idea<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.500> splitting

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
it at that I hate the idea of splitting

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.200 
it at that I hate the idea of splitting
up<00:04:56.010> Brock<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.430> Paul<00:04:56.610> because<00:04:57.000> they're

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
up Brock and Paul because they're

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.960 
up Brock and Paul because they're
they're<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.320> inseparable<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.550> know<00:04:59.670> together

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
they're so inseparable you know together

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.180 
they're so inseparable you know together
there's<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.110> much<00:05:01.230> better<00:05:01.530> than<00:05:01.710> they<00:05:01.860> are<00:05:01.890> in

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
there's so much better than they are in

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.140 
there's so much better than they are in
Division<00:05:02.490> as<00:05:02.580> great<00:05:02.790> as<00:05:02.880> they<00:05:03.000> are

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
Division as great as they are

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.480 
Division as great as they are
individually<00:05:03.810> together<00:05:04.230> they're<00:05:05.010> they're

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
just unbeatable as a combo and I really

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.640 
just unbeatable as a combo and I really
would<00:05:09.180> only<00:05:09.330> entertain<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.990> idea<00:05:10.020> if<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.500> knew

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
would only entertain the idea if I knew

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.530 
would only entertain the idea if I knew
Brock<00:05:10.920> wasn't<00:05:11.280> gonna<00:05:11.370> come<00:05:11.610> back<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:12.180> we<00:05:12.420> were

Brock wasn't gonna come back and we were
