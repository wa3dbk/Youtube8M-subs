showing<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.150> how<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.360> make<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.740> block<00:00:28.490> print

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
showing you how to make a block print

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.360

either<00:00:29.210> with<00:00:29.810> linoleum<00:00:30.170> or<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.710> rubber<00:00:31.070> block

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
either with linoleum or a rubber block

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.910 
either with linoleum or a rubber block
the<00:00:31.940> difference<00:00:32.330> is<00:00:32.630> linoleum<00:00:33.500> is<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.710> lot

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
the difference is linoleum is a lot

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.310 
the difference is linoleum is a lot
stiffer<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.610> harder<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.180> carve<00:00:35.420> but<00:00:36.020> it'll

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
stiffer and harder to carve but it'll

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.870 
stiffer and harder to carve but it'll
last<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.710> lot<00:00:36.800> longer<00:00:36.860> through<00:00:37.400> multiple

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
last a lot longer through multiple

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.370 
last a lot longer through multiple
printings<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.540> rubber<00:00:38.720> block<00:00:38.989> print<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.350> like

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
printings the rubber block print is like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.590 
printings the rubber block print is like
carving<00:00:39.860> butter<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.850> really<00:00:41.090> nice<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.480> easy

quickly then when Oleum does you also

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.220 
quickly then when Oleum does you also
need<00:00:48.920> ink<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:50.059> can<00:00:50.089> get<00:00:50.360> water-based<00:00:50.989> or

is<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.140> lay<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.320> paper<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.219> block<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.700> use

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
is to lay the paper on the block and use

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.170 
is to lay the paper on the block and use
a<00:01:35.299> blunt<00:01:35.630> tool<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.520> transfer<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> pencil<00:01:38.030> on

to the block so you want to carve away
what's<00:01:41.810> going<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.049> be<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.320> negative<00:01:42.530> space<00:01:44.560> so

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
what's going to be the negative space so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.080 
what's going to be the negative space so
whatever<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:45.979> leave<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.549> actually<00:01:46.909> gonna

but it's called a bench hook for an

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.410 
but it's called a bench hook for an
inking<00:01:55.460> plate<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.939> can<00:01:56.119> use<00:01:56.270> it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
inking plate and you can use it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.819 
inking plate and you can use it
especially<00:01:57.140> if<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.560> have<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.710> larger<00:01:58.130> plate

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
especially if you have a larger plate

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.069 
especially if you have a larger plate
once<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:00.920> get<00:02:01.070> some<00:02:01.630> resistance<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.020> you

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
once you get some resistance so you

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.539 
once you get some resistance so you
don't<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.380> put<00:02:03.560> your<00:02:03.679> hand<00:02:03.890> back<00:02:04.039> here<00:02:04.310> in

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
don't have to put your hand back here in

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.120 
don't have to put your hand back here in
the<00:02:04.789> path<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.359> gouge<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:06.829> can<00:02:06.950> just

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
the path of the gouge you can just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.100 
the path of the gouge you can just
bounce<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.060> way<00:02:08.240> whether<00:02:08.690> your<00:02:08.899> hand

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
bounce it that way whether your hand

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.719 
bounce it that way whether your hand
back<00:02:09.289> here<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.740> don't<00:02:09.890> cut<00:02:10.070> yourself<00:02:10.160> open

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
back here so you don't cut yourself open

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.180 
back here so you don't cut yourself open
which<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.360> pleasant<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:13.010> rubber

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
which is not pleasant for the rubber

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.500 
which is not pleasant for the rubber
it's<00:02:13.370> not<00:02:13.550> such<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> big<00:02:13.940> deal<00:02:14.000> because<00:02:14.330> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's not such a big deal because it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.510 
it's not such a big deal because it
doesn't<00:02:15.050> take<00:02:15.170> much

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
doesn't take much

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.790 
doesn't take much
to<00:02:15.640> carve<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.570> I'm<00:02:16.870> gonna<00:02:17.080> start<00:02:17.500> with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
to carve so and I'm gonna start with

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.270 
to carve so and I'm gonna start with
this<00:02:18.100> smallest<00:02:18.460> detail<00:02:19.270> tip<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:20.280> carve

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
this smallest detail tip and carve

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.020 
this smallest detail tip and carve
around<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:23.020> outline<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.620> J<00:02:23.830> first<00:02:24.130> this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
around the outline of the J first this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.870 
around the outline of the J first this
being<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.630> simple<00:02:26.380> design<00:02:26.800> they<00:02:27.520> use<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
being a simple design they use the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.610 
being a simple design they use the
smallest<00:02:28.120> one<00:02:28.360> then<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.290> use<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
smallest one then I really can use the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.140 
smallest one then I really can use the
biggest<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.520> rest<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.090> I'm

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
biggest one to get the rest of it so I'm

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.300 
biggest one to get the rest of it so I'm
going<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.330> use<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> largest<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.190> go

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
going to use the largest one to just go

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.160 
going to use the largest one to just go
ahead<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.640> get<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.180> negative<00:02:34.720> space<00:02:34.960> out

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
ahead and get the negative space out

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.770 
ahead and get the negative space out
quickly

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.869 

so<00:02:41.780> next<00:02:42.499> what<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.859> to<00:02:42.980> do<00:02:43.099> is<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:43.730> gonna

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
so next what I like to do is I'm gonna

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.500 
so next what I like to do is I'm gonna
go<00:02:44.180> rinse<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> block<00:02:46.159> off<00:02:46.430> because<00:02:46.639> when<00:02:47.420> you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
go rinse the block off because when you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.699 
go rinse the block off because when you
carve<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> get<00:02:48.170> these<00:02:48.260> little<00:02:48.409> rubber

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
carve it you get these little rubber

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.910 
carve it you get these little rubber
pail<00:02:49.069> pills<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.939> and<00:02:50.150> they<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.049> get<00:02:51.499> in<00:02:51.680> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
pail pills in it and they can get in the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.860 
pail pills in it and they can get in the
ink<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.819> know<00:02:52.969> get<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.239> your<00:02:53.389> print<00:02:53.629> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
ink and you know get on your print and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.199 
ink and you know get on your print and
the<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.409> pencil<00:02:54.829> will<00:02:54.950> often<00:02:55.310> transfer<00:02:55.849> after

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
the the pencil will often transfer after

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.729 
the the pencil will often transfer after
you've<00:02:56.540> rinsed<00:02:56.659> it<00:02:56.900> now<00:02:57.079> it's<00:02:57.260> time<00:02:57.439> to<00:02:57.590> print

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
you've rinsed it now it's time to print

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.860 
you've rinsed it now it's time to print
first<00:02:58.069> thing<00:02:58.219> you<00:02:58.310> do<00:02:58.489> is<00:02:58.700> pick<00:02:59.060> up<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.750> ink

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
first thing you do is pick up the ink

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.890 
first thing you do is pick up the ink
and<00:03:00.170> put<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.099> on<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:02.030> inking<00:03:02.450> plate<00:03:02.659> and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and put it on to the inking plate and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.080 
and put it on to the inking plate and
kind<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.739> roll<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.400> out<00:03:05.049> get<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.079> even<00:03:07.090> evenly

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
kind of roll it out get it even evenly

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.970 
kind of roll it out get it even evenly
distributed<00:03:08.719> on<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.900> brayer<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.799> want<00:03:09.919> to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
distributed on the brayer you want to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.770 
distributed on the brayer you want to
make<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.189> ink<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.669> what<00:03:10.819> they<00:03:10.939> call<00:03:11.150> sane<00:03:11.480> when

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
make the ink do what they call sane when

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.580 
make the ink do what they call sane when
you<00:03:11.870> hear<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.519> singing<00:03:14.319> that's<00:03:15.319> when

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
you hear it kind of singing that's when

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.149 
you hear it kind of singing that's when
it's<00:03:15.739> ready<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.159> put<00:03:16.489> on<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:17.060> block<00:03:21.159> with

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
it's ready to put on to the block with

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.409 
it's ready to put on to the block with
the<00:03:22.250> rubber<00:03:22.430> block<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:22.760> can<00:03:22.909> just<00:03:23.060> pick<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.239> up

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
the rubber block you can just pick it up

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.879 
the rubber block you can just pick it up
and<00:03:23.599> turn<00:03:23.719> it<00:03:23.870> upside<00:03:24.169> down<00:03:24.199> because<00:03:24.769> it

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
and turn it upside down because it

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.189 
and turn it upside down because it
doesn't<00:03:25.159> take<00:03:25.310> much<00:03:25.459> pressure<00:03:25.819> at<00:03:26.060> all<00:03:26.209> and

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
doesn't take much pressure at all and

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.459 
doesn't take much pressure at all and
just<00:03:28.359> put<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.449> on<00:03:29.540> there<00:03:29.719> tap<00:03:30.169> it<00:03:30.319> down<00:03:30.409> a

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
just put it on there tap it down a

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.520 
just put it on there tap it down a
little<00:03:30.709> bit

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.220 

with<00:03:36.130> linoleum<00:03:36.660> kind<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.840> lay<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.140> on

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
with linoleum kind of like lay it on

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.990 
with linoleum kind of like lay it on
there<00:03:38.410> softly<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.040> don't<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.430> smear<00:03:39.880> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
there softly so you don't like smear it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.050 
there softly so you don't like smear it
across<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.450> aim<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.680> kind<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> like<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.940> it

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
across the aim and I kind of like do it

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.300 
across the aim and I kind of like do it
my<00:03:43.180> hands<00:03:43.450> first<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.530> kind<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:44.860> sticks<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
my hands first it it kind of sticks the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.800 
my hands first it it kind of sticks the
paper<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.000> makes<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.270> less<00:03:46.450> likely<00:03:46.660> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
paper to it and makes it less likely to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.840 
paper to it and makes it less likely to
slide<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.380> think<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.160> take<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.550> Baron
