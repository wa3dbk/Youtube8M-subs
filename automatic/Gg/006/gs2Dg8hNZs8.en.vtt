actually start animating this I
recommend<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.460> use<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.790> same<00:01:29.060> render

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
recommend you use the same render

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.090 
recommend you use the same render
settings<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:29.930> i<00:01:30.020> am<00:01:30.170> using<00:01:30.200> because<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:30.950> has

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
settings that i am using because it has

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.290 
settings that i am using because it has
really<00:01:31.340> good<00:01:31.810> speed<00:01:32.810> for<00:01:33.020> its<00:01:33.950> quality<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.520> it

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
really good speed for its quality and it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.950 
really good speed for its quality and it
also<00:01:35.390> has<00:01:36.970> well<00:01:37.970> should<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.600> alpha

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
also has well should have the alpha

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.020 
also has well should have the alpha
channel<00:01:38.990> checked<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.490> when<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.850> actually

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
channel checked so when you actually

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.090 
channel checked so when you actually
render<00:01:41.510> it<00:01:41.600> out<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.110> only<00:01:42.320> renders<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.740> cod4

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
render it out it only renders a cod4

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.350 
render it out it only renders a cod4
character<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.260> nothing<00:01:45.260> else<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.820> could

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
character and nothing else so you could

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.450 
character and nothing else so you could
just<00:01:47.510> clearly<00:01:47.960> put<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:48.650> Sony<00:01:48.830> Vegas<00:01:48.920> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
just clearly put it in Sony Vegas and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.730 
just clearly put it in Sony Vegas and
key<00:01:50.000> out<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.180> Alpha<00:01:50.690> Channel<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.620> can

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
key out the Alpha Channel and you can

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.649 
key out the Alpha Channel and you can
just<00:01:51.830> put<00:01:51.979> whatever<00:01:52.250> backdrop<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.909> want<00:01:53.150> but

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
a little more advanced and I this story

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.559 
a little more advanced and I this story
else<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.640> basically<00:02:08.060> showing<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.450> how<00:02:08.539> to

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
else is basically showing you how to

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.430 
else is basically showing you how to
just<00:02:09.259> animate<00:02:09.679> some<00:02:09.830> first<00:02:10.039> person<00:02:10.369> okay<00:02:11.360> so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
just animate some first person okay so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.630 
just animate some first person okay so
we<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> camera<00:02:13.190> where<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.400> click

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
we just go to the camera where you click

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.270 
we just go to the camera where you click
this<00:02:13.849> target<00:02:14.299> right<00:02:14.480> here<00:02:14.690> its<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.830> course<00:02:15.890> on

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
this target right here its of course on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.170 
this target right here its of course on
an<00:02:16.790> object<00:02:17.080> tag<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.010> head<00:02:19.400> we're<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:20.000> least

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
an object tag to the head we're at least

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.809 
an object tag to the head we're at least
where<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> head<00:02:20.599> used<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:20.989> but<00:02:21.860> yes<00:02:22.129> right

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
where the head used to be but yes right

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.399 
where the head used to be but yes right
here<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.659> keyframes<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.290> of

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
here we have a lot of keyframes you of

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.840 
here we have a lot of keyframes you of
course<00:02:24.560> can<00:02:24.799> edit<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.060> will<00:02:26.269> want

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
course can edit this as you will want

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.780 
course can edit this as you will want
and<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.220> want<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.550> move<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and we really do not want to move the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.450 
and we really do not want to move the
cameras<00:02:30.500> coordinates<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.040> will<00:02:32.250> mess

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
cameras coordinates because it will mess

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.430 
cameras coordinates because it will mess
it<00:02:32.490> up<00:02:32.700> yeah<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.810> we'll<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.170> leave<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.350> at

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
it up yeah so we'll just leave it at

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
it up yeah so we'll just leave it at
that<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:35.280> sorry<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.850> wanted<00:02:36.090> more<00:02:36.270> like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that I'm sorry if you wanted more like

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.440 
that I'm sorry if you wanted more like
nodding<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.530> down<00:02:37.710> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.460> first<00:02:39.270> person

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
nodding up and down kind of first person

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.290 
nodding up and down kind of first person
but<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> am<00:02:40.620> not<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.950> advanced<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:41.940> creating

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
but I am not that advanced that creating

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.640 
but I am not that advanced that creating
that<00:02:42.450> yet<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:42.900> least<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.500> yet

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that yet or at least I have not yet

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.950 
that yet or at least I have not yet
tried<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.270> really<00:02:45.420> simple<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.930> just

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
tried but this is really simple we just

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.230 
tried but this is really simple we just
want<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> move<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> move

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
want to move these we just want to move

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.490 
want to move these we just want to move
to<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.700> degrees<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.750> want<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.020> move<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
to the degrees we don't want to move the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.400 
to the degrees we don't want to move the
cord<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.010> any<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.520> coordinates<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.230> let's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
cord in any other coordinates so let's

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.120 
cord in any other coordinates so let's
go<00:02:55.560> see<00:02:55.710> right<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.460> just<00:02:56.730> keep<00:02:57.090> brain

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
go see right here we just keep brain

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.490 
go see right here we just keep brain
this<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.400> then<00:02:59.610> we<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.760> go<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> say<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> 200

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
this and then we just go to say to 200

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.760 
this and then we just go to say to 200
and<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.640> move<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.060> arm<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:04.200> try<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> keep

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
and we can move the arm and try to keep

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.950 
and we can move the arm and try to keep
it<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.400> does<00:03:05.670> not<00:03:05.820> mess<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.480> rest<00:03:06.840> of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
it so it does not mess up the rest of

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.170 
it so it does not mess up the rest of
the<00:03:07.050> elbow<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.980> basically<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.700> lets<00:03:09.060> you

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the elbow that basically just lets you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.930 
the elbow that basically just lets you
know<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:10.140> organic<00:03:10.710> movements<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.400> now

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
know that it's organic movements and now

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.140 
know that it's organic movements and now
that<00:03:12.120> we're<00:03:12.240> at<00:03:12.330> 200<00:03:12.810> yes<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.470> moves<00:03:13.740> pretty

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that we're at 200 yes it moves pretty

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.100 
that we're at 200 yes it moves pretty
pretty<00:03:15.560> motion<00:03:16.760> humane<00:03:17.760> humilis<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.690> can't

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
pretty motion humane humilis I can't

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.900 
pretty motion humane humilis I can't
really<00:03:19.230> say<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:20.220> doesn't<00:03:20.310> move<00:03:20.610> really

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
really say like it doesn't move really

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.050 
really say like it doesn't move really
human<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.650> course<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.460> 200

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
human but of course you could go to 200

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 
human but of course you could go to 200
put<00:03:24.510> them<00:03:24.600> bein<00:03:24.780> basic<00:03:25.350> keyframe<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:25.830> you

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
put them bein basic keyframe then you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490 
put them bein basic keyframe then you
can<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.160> move<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.180> slightly<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.230> looks

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
can just move it slightly so it looks

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160 
can just move it slightly so it looks
more<00:03:28.710> human<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.490> when<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.760> moving<00:03:30.170> so

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
more human so when it's moving so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.740 
more human so when it's moving so
actually<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:31.740> go<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> target<00:03:32.940> now<00:03:33.690> we

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
actually if we go to the target now we

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.070 
actually if we go to the target now we
will<00:03:34.370> put<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.490> back<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> arm

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
will put it back and you can see the arm

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.070 
will put it back and you can see the arm
move<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:38.640> course<00:03:38.670> what<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.600> recommend<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
move and of course what I recommend is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.290 
move and of course what I recommend is
just<00:03:40.350> put<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.770> basic<00:03:41.130> keep<00:03:41.310> framework<00:03:41.940> where

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
just put a basic keep framework where

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.810 
just put a basic keep framework where
your<00:03:42.450> arm<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.900> go<00:03:43.530> say<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.250> keyframe<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
your arm is go say to a keyframe you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.420 
your arm is go say to a keyframe you
want<00:03:45.380> put<00:03:46.380> another<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:46.770> where<00:03:47.010> it's<00:03:47.160> moved

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
want put another one where it's moved

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.750 
want put another one where it's moved
into<00:03:47.730> your<00:03:48.060> scene<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:50.040> could<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.550> back

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
into your scene and you could go back

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.820 
into your scene and you could go back
and<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.510> could<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:51.690> animate<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> arm<00:03:52.530> more

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
and you could just animate the arm more

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.250 
and you could just animate the arm more
moving<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.280> sideways<00:03:53.880> slightly<00:03:54.300> just<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.170> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
moving it sideways slightly just so it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.580 
moving it sideways slightly just so it
looks<00:03:55.410> more<00:03:55.530> organic<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.880> mean<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.110> animation

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
looks more organic I mean the animation

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.870 
looks more organic I mean the animation
will<00:03:58.710> look<00:03:58.830> more<00:03:59.010> organic<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.610> more<00:03:59.790> effort

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
will look more organic the more effort

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.570 
will look more organic the more effort
you<00:04:00.060> put<00:04:00.270> into<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.720> course<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:02.220> can

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
you put into it of course and you can

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.630 
you put into it of course and you can
animate<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.270> forearm<00:04:03.690> as<00:04:03.870> well<00:04:04.250> as<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.490> can

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
animate the forearm as well as you can

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.510 
animate the forearm as well as you can
see<00:04:05.790> here<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.680> animate<00:04:08.100> pretty<00:04:08.400> much

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
see here and you can animate pretty much

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.670 
see here and you can animate pretty much
everything<00:04:09.060> even<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.570> hand<00:04:09.900> although<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
everything even the hand although you

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.990 
everything even the hand although you
don't<00:04:10.830> want<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.070> twist<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:11.640> as<00:04:11.850> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
don't want to twist it because as you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.060 
don't want to twist it because as you
can<00:04:12.030> imagine<00:04:12.180> sewn<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.990> human<00:04:13.530> cannot<00:04:13.800> twist

can imagine sewn a human cannot twist

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.760 
can imagine sewn a human cannot twist
this<00:04:14.250> risk<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:14.720> much<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.590> fingers

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
this risk that much and the fingers

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.250 
this risk that much and the fingers
unfortunately<00:04:17.549> due<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.940> model<00:04:18.260> it's

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.040 
it's crudely done just because I was
just<00:06:02.980> getting<00:06:03.220> used<00:06:03.490> to<00:06:04.090> this<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.450> anyways

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
just getting used to this so anyways

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.290 
just getting used to this so anyways
just<00:06:05.920> show<00:06:06.220> you<00:06:06.280> how<00:06:06.460> to<00:06:06.520> keep<00:06:06.730> out<00:06:06.880> stuff<00:06:07.150> if

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
just show you how to keep out stuff if

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.240 
just show you how to keep out stuff if
you<00:06:07.420> don't<00:06:07.600> know<00:06:07.690> how<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:08.110> key<00:06:08.680> up<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.980> Alpha

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
you don't know how to key up the Alpha

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.310 
you don't know how to key up the Alpha
Channel<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.700> it's<00:06:10.330> not<00:06:10.480> just<00:06:10.630> as<00:06:10.840> simple<00:06:11.050> as

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
Channel and it's not just as simple as

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.470 
Channel and it's not just as simple as
adding<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.740> chroma<00:06:12.100> key<00:06:12.250> this<00:06:12.820> is<00:06:13.030> actually<00:06:13.450> a

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
adding a chroma key this is actually a

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.390 
adding a chroma key this is actually a
lot<00:06:13.630> better<00:06:13.690> I<00:06:14.110> believe<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:15.010> looks<00:06:15.220> it

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
lot better I believe and it looks it

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.860 
lot better I believe and it looks it
looks<00:06:15.460> a<00:06:15.880> lot<00:06:16.000> better<00:06:16.150> i<00:06:16.300> mean<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:16.510> could<00:06:16.630> add

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
looks a lot better i mean you could add

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.020 
looks a lot better i mean you could add
it<00:06:17.050> but<00:06:17.560> that<00:06:17.710> will<00:06:17.830> just<00:06:18.010> ruin<00:06:18.250> it<00:06:18.520> for<00:06:19.000> me

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
it but that will just ruin it for me

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.970 
it but that will just ruin it for me
because<00:06:19.390> there<00:06:19.630> is<00:06:19.810> shading<00:06:20.230> inside<00:06:20.800> the

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
because there is shading inside the

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.190 
because there is shading inside the
colorful<00:06:21.460> model<00:06:21.910> but<00:06:22.330> if<00:06:22.510> you<00:06:22.660> actually<00:06:22.840> pull

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
colorful model but if you actually pull

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.600 
colorful model but if you actually pull
their<00:06:23.380> as<00:06:23.560> you<00:06:23.650> can<00:06:23.770> see<00:06:23.920> there's<00:06:24.400> no

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
their as you can see there's no

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.400 
their as you can see there's no
checkerboard<00:06:25.480> pattern<00:06:25.780> in<00:06:25.900> the<00:06:25.990> background

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
checkerboard pattern in the background

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.440 
checkerboard pattern in the background
but<00:06:27.090> if<00:06:28.090> we<00:06:28.390> go<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:29.860> media<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.490> go<00:06:31.030> to<00:06:31.090> alpha

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
but if we go to media and go to alpha

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.540 
but if we go to media and go to alpha
channel<00:06:31.780> go<00:06:32.590> ahead<00:06:32.800> and<00:06:32.920> click<00:06:33.010> straight<00:06:33.370> and

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
channel go ahead and click straight and

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.240 
channel go ahead and click straight and
unmet<00:06:33.850> it<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.260> there<00:06:35.260> we<00:06:35.350> go<00:06:35.500> we<00:06:35.860> got<00:06:36.040> a<00:06:36.070> nice

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
unmet it and there we go we got a nice

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.870 
unmet it and there we go we got a nice
backer<00:06:36.580> now<00:06:37.240> if<00:06:37.510> you<00:06:37.690> actually<00:06:38.010> say<00:06:39.010> you're

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
backer now if you actually say you're

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.700 
backer now if you actually say you're
recording<00:06:40.210> some<00:06:40.570> cod4<00:06:40.780> cinematics<00:06:41.500> if<00:06:41.620> you

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
recording some cod4 cinematics if you

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.370 
recording some cod4 cinematics if you
just<00:06:42.160> go<00:06:42.430> ahead<00:06:42.580> and<00:06:42.730> drop<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.510> actual

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
just go ahead and drop the actual

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.740 
just go ahead and drop the actual
smoking<00:06:45.010> animation<00:06:45.430> anywhere<00:06:46.270> you<00:06:46.300> want<00:06:46.600> it

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
smoking animation anywhere you want it

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.680 
smoking animation anywhere you want it
and<00:06:47.490> of<00:06:48.490> course<00:06:48.550> it'll<00:06:48.940> look<00:06:49.090> more<00:06:49.270> organic

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
and of course it'll look more organic

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.870 
and of course it'll look more organic
because<00:06:50.110> i<00:06:50.170> doubt<00:06:50.560> more<00:06:50.860> many<00:06:51.370> car<00:06:51.640> for

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
because i doubt more many car for

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.160 
because i doubt more many car for
characters<00:06:52.240> would<00:06:52.330> be<00:06:52.390> in<00:06:52.600> checkerboard

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
characters would be in checkerboard

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.830 
characters would be in checkerboard
pattern<00:06:53.890> land<00:06:54.100> so<00:06:54.580> that's<00:06:55.270> just<00:06:55.390> a<00:06:55.600> really

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
pattern land so that's just a really

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.020 
pattern land so that's just a really
guys<00:06:56.020> nice<00:06:56.410> white<00:06:56.650> to<00:06:57.250> make<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.610> happen<00:06:57.760> and

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
guys nice white to make that happen and

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.120 
guys nice white to make that happen and
for<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.960> actual<00:06:59.170> blinking<00:06:59.650> it's<00:06:59.800> as<00:06:59.950> simple

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
for the actual blinking it's as simple

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.470 
for the actual blinking it's as simple
as<00:07:00.400> this<00:07:00.640> just<00:07:00.940> added<00:07:01.240> color<00:07:01.690> ratings<00:07:02.140> and

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.690 

we<00:07:06.350> just<00:07:06.530> make<00:07:06.680> fun<00:07:07.040> I'll<00:07:07.070> make<00:07:07.250> it<00:07:07.370> look<00:07:07.520> like

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
we just make fun I'll make it look like

guys we just got like this I'm going to

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.820 
guys we just got like this I'm going to
draw<00:07:13.580> make<00:07:14.390> this<00:07:14.570> okay<00:07:14.960> so<00:07:15.470> we're<00:07:15.650> going<00:07:15.740> to

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
draw make this okay so we're going to

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.150 
draw make this okay so we're going to
emit<00:07:16.190> you're<00:07:17.120> going<00:07:17.270> to<00:07:17.330> make<00:07:17.480> it<00:07:17.860> go<00:07:18.860> a<00:07:18.890> couple

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
emit you're going to make it go a couple

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.640 
emit you're going to make it go a couple
key<00:07:19.400> frames<00:07:19.640> late<00:07:20.120> of<00:07:20.510> course<00:07:20.960> all<00:07:21.320> this

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
key frames late of course all this

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.590 
key frames late of course all this
organic<00:07:21.830> animation<00:07:22.820> the<00:07:22.970> blinking<00:07:23.450> the

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
organic animation the blinking the

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.070 
organic animation the blinking the
moving<00:07:23.930> of<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.080> arms<00:07:24.200> all<00:07:25.060> it<00:07:26.060> just<00:07:26.270> will<00:07:26.900> all

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
moving of the arms all it just will all

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.380 
moving of the arms all it just will all
look<00:07:27.500> better<00:07:27.770> depending<00:07:28.670> on<00:07:28.670> how<00:07:28.940> much<00:07:29.150> effort

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
look better depending on how much effort

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.690 
look better depending on how much effort
you<00:07:29.690> put<00:07:29.990> into<00:07:30.170> the<00:07:30.380> keyframes<00:07:30.860> to<00:07:31.400> make<00:07:31.550> it

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
you put into the keyframes to make it

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.960 
you put into the keyframes to make it
look<00:07:31.850> better<00:07:31.970> or<00:07:32.270> so<00:07:32.920> this<00:07:33.920> is<00:07:34.100> basically<00:07:34.250> it

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
look better or so this is basically it

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.260 
look better or so this is basically it
just<00:07:35.240> the<00:07:35.750> blinking<00:07:36.110> animation<00:07:37.270> scroller

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270 
just the blinking animation scroller

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.960 
just the blinking animation scroller
wheels<00:07:38.540> losing<00:07:39.290> traction<00:07:39.620> apparently<00:07:40.220> but

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:40.970 
wheels losing traction apparently but

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.050 
wheels losing traction apparently but
yeah<00:07:41.090> now<00:07:41.660> you<00:07:41.720> just<00:07:42.020> add<00:07:42.260> that<00:07:42.470> keyframe

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.060 
yeah now you just add that keyframe

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.960 
yeah now you just add that keyframe
coffee<00:07:44.060> it<00:07:44.330> if<00:07:45.140> you're<00:07:45.320> lazy<00:07:45.560> like<00:07:45.740> me<00:07:45.970> there

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:49.670 
for the sake of the tutorial to make it

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.060 
for the sake of the tutorial to make it
look<00:07:49.880> like<00:07:50.090> he's<00:07:50.240> blinking<00:07:50.570> that's<00:07:51.110> simple<00:07:51.500> so

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.070 
look like he's blinking that's simple so

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.350 
look like he's blinking that's simple so
I<00:07:52.100> hope<00:07:52.250> you<00:07:52.370> guys<00:07:52.400> enjoyed<00:07:52.910> this<00:07:53.060> has<00:07:53.240> been
