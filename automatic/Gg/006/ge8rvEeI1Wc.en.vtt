it's got tilt release that locks both

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.560 
it's got tilt release that locks both
ways<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.340> for<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> most<00:00:29.580> parts<00:00:29.939> kind<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
ways and for the most parts kind of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.770 
ways and for the most parts kind of
smooth<00:00:30.840> enough<00:00:31.109> doesn't<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.099> stuck

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
smooth enough doesn't really get stuck

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.709 
smooth enough doesn't really get stuck
comes<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.200> bowls<00:00:35.600> stainless<00:00:36.600> steel<00:00:36.960> and

comes with two bowls stainless steel and

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.240 
comes with two bowls stainless steel and
these<00:00:39.719> actually<00:00:40.320> uh<00:00:41.480> these<00:00:42.480> ones<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
these actually uh these ones have a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
these actually uh these ones have a
rotating<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.360> pedestal<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
rotating that you know pedestal that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.910 
rotating that you know pedestal that
pulls<00:00:46.920> quickened<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.559> there's<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
pulls quickened and then there's a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090 
pulls quickened and then there's a
little<00:00:50.100> switch<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.590> shifts<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.949> got

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
little switch here that shifts it's got

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.689 
little switch here that shifts it's got
two<00:00:53.340> icons<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.090> which<00:00:54.960> size<00:00:55.199> Bowl<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
two icons of which size Bowl so and that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.630 
two icons of which size Bowl so and that
basically<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> aligns<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.640> mixer

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
basically just how it aligns the mixer

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.080 
basically just how it aligns the mixer
so<00:01:00.620> there's<00:01:01.620> lock<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.100> place<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.930> good

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
so there's lock into place very good

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
so there's lock into place very good
comes<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.470> some<00:01:07.470> dough<00:01:07.680> hooks<00:01:09.140> sort<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
comes with some dough hooks sort of the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.359 
comes with some dough hooks sort of the
wire<00:01:10.890> beaters<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> flat

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
wire beaters and you know the flat

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
wire beaters and you know the flat
beater<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> they're<00:01:17.280> color-coded<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
beater and they're color-coded so you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
beater and they're color-coded so you
can<00:01:19.170> tell<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.110> which<00:01:22.320> side<00:01:22.790> they<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:24.030> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
can tell you know which side they go in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.020 
can tell you know which side they go in
because<00:01:24.920> there<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.570> red<00:01:27.869> dot<00:01:28.110> for

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
because there is a you know red dot for

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.010 
because there is a you know red dot for
obviously<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> red<00:01:30.479> one

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.779 

clicks<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:35.240> clicks<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:37.520> here's<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
clicks in clicks in there here's the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.730 
clicks in clicks in there here's the
little<00:01:39.539> slide<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.109> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.289> that<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
little slide you can see that just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490 
little slide you can see that just
adjust<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:42.299> bow<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.140> bow<00:01:43.289> like

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
adjust a little bow like on big bow like

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
adjust a little bow like on big bow like
on<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:46.219> it's<00:01:47.219> got<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.429> little<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:47.969> here<00:01:48.649> as

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
on and it's got a little thing here as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.010 
on and it's got a little thing here as
far<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.630> which<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> turn<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:53.719> lock<00:01:54.719> or

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
far as which way to turn to lock or

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.469 
far as which way to turn to lock or
unlock<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.700> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> common<00:02:00.149> thread

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
unlock but it's a kind of common thread

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.149 
unlock but it's a kind of common thread
so<00:02:01.670> counterclockwise<00:02:02.670> done<00:02:03.179> lock<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> then

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so counterclockwise done lock and then

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.530 
so counterclockwise done lock and then
of<00:02:05.280> course<00:02:05.899> it's<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.810> speeds<00:02:10.200> itself

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
of course it's got the speeds itself

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.680 
of course it's got the speeds itself
basically<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.670> turns<00:02:14.670> turn<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
basically just this turns turn it on and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.240 
basically just this turns turn it on and
it's<00:02:15.810> got<00:02:16.019> zeros<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.349> it's<00:02:19.349> got<00:02:19.530> one

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.640

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you can see as you turn that on

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000 
you can see as you turn that on
basically<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.410> know<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.890> would

out<00:02:58.070> which<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.250> right<00:02:59.460> here<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.810> pretty<00:03:01.640> it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
out which is right here is pretty it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.440 
out which is right here is pretty it
actually<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.900> stiff<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.370> know<00:03:06.270> these

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
actually really stiff and you know these

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.530 
actually really stiff and you know these
don't<00:03:07.430> really<00:03:08.430> pop<00:03:08.670> out<00:03:08.880> easily

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
don't really pop out easily
