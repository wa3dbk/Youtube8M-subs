 madam sir hello disturbed time 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.750
 still today on the country because 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.910
 of this depression centered on the sea 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.530
 from the north of this cloudy charter that 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.570
 wraps around that gave a time 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.609
 rainy on the most 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.259
 southern and that cold air in 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.999
 altitude that settled above the 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.769
 a country that promotes instability with 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.599
 many showers on a quarter 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.320
 northwestern same type of weather for 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.509
 tomorrow with still a lot 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.669
 instability instability that is going 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.410
 fade on Thursday because of a surge 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.120
 from the anticyclone by the west 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.880
 let's look at the map for tomorrow morning 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.070

 east and showers sometimes quite 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.740
 frequent especially on a big 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.750
 quarter northeast of the showers that take 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.120
 a stormy character and that can be 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.130
 accompanied by ice pellets 1 on the west 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.570
