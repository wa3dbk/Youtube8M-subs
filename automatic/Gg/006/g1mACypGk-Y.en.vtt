00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
insane and it was against the Packers

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280 
insane and it was against the Packers
defense<00:02:21.150> which<00:02:21.660> isn't<00:02:21.960> really<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.260> best

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
defense which isn't really the best

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.840 
defense which isn't really the best
defense<00:02:23.210> really<00:02:24.210> out<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.350> i<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
defense really out there but i think the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.400 
defense really out there but i think the
falcons<00:02:27.360> did<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.570> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:27.960> better<00:02:28.050> job

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
falcons did a little bit better job

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.620 
falcons did a little bit better job
container<00:02:28.770> Russell<00:02:29.130> Wilson<00:02:29.430> did<00:02:29.640> against

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
container Russell Wilson did against

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
container Russell Wilson did against
Russell<00:02:30.810> Wilson<00:02:31.170> today<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.060> Falcon<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
Russell Wilson today then the Falcon I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.510 
Russell Wilson today then the Falcon I
mean<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> Packers<00:02:34.440> did<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:35.220> Colin

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
mean then the Packers did with Colin

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670 
mean then the Packers did with Colin
Kaepernick<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.510> mean<00:02:37.290> they're<00:02:37.500> two

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
Kaepernick but I mean they're two

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.810 
Kaepernick but I mean they're two
different<00:02:37.860> animals<00:02:38.100> really<00:02:38.460> Colin

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
different animals really Colin

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.310 
different animals really Colin
Kaepernick's<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> likes<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.840> run<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> little<00:02:40.140> bit

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
Kaepernick's I likes to run a little bit

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.720 
Kaepernick's I likes to run a little bit
more<00:02:40.410> think<00:02:40.650> Russell<00:02:40.950> Wilson's<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> little<00:02:41.640> bit

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
more think Russell Wilson's a little bit

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360 
more think Russell Wilson's a little bit
more<00:02:41.880> established<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> pure<00:02:43.110> passer<00:02:43.410> but

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
more established as a pure passer but

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.210 
more established as a pure passer but
we'll<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.760> where<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.000> goes<00:02:45.060> um<00:02:45.920> I'm<00:02:46.920> not

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
we'll see where that goes um I'm not

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220 
we'll see where that goes um I'm not
necessarily<00:02:47.940> convinced<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> Falcons

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
necessarily convinced that the Falcons

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.870 
necessarily convinced that the Falcons
defense<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.680> much<00:02:49.860> better<00:02:50.130> than<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.400> Packers

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
defense is much better than the Packers

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060 
defense is much better than the Packers
some<00:02:51.660> might<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.170> something<00:02:52.530> else<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.800> say<00:02:53.040> to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
some might have something else to say to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.210 
some might have something else to say to
that<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:53.850> my<00:02:54.750> opinion<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:56.070> think

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that but that's my opinion and I think

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.350 
that but that's my opinion and I think
it<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.430> very<00:02:56.489> very<00:02:56.820> tough<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
it can be very very tough for the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.810 
it can be very very tough for the
Falcons<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.900> contain<00:02:58.290> Colin<00:02:58.680> Kaepernick<00:02:59.160> but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
Falcons to contain Colin Kaepernick but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it will be fun though to see how they

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.400 
it will be fun though to see how they
try<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> contain<00:03:02.160> him<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:03.390> big<00:03:03.840> key<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.930 
Falcons defense be fun to see Michael
Crabtree<00:03:58.440> Asante<00:03:59.130> Samuel<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.610> going<00:03:59.790> at<00:03:59.910> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
Crabtree Asante Samuel is going at it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.750 
Crabtree Asante Samuel is going at it
and<00:04:00.230> etc<00:04:01.230> etc<00:04:02.150> but<00:04:03.150> man<00:04:03.769> such<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> tough<00:04:05.250> game<00:04:05.459> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and etc etc but man such a tough game to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.870 
and etc etc but man such a tough game to
pick<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.739> comes<00:04:07.980> down<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.610> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
pick but I think it comes down to the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.970 
pick but I think it comes down to the
running<00:04:09.090> game<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.930> which<00:04:10.320> team<00:04:10.560> has<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.769> better

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
running game and which team has a better

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.319 
running game and which team has a better
defense<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.750> all<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:13.290> agree<00:04:13.350> on

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
defense and I think we all can agree on

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.940 
defense and I think we all can agree on
that's<00:04:15.329> better<00:04:15.510> defenses<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.290> 49ers<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.859> I

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that's better defenses the 49ers and I

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.949 
that's better defenses the 49ers and I
said<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.400> initial<00:04:17.760> video<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.810> watch
