00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440

 pleasant kuni neighbors you just 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.019
 were amazed but I want to say that this is him 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.120
 proved once again that the goalkeepers there are one 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.850
 of the main figures in the team and he is somewhere 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.250
 really played just awesome 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 the show rolled its rut how can it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.740
 I want to play the whole team 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.960
 tried hard 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 someone got someone no spirit he 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.910
 was and and goalkeeper brad confidence 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 team and team third period 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 all the same 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.219
 showed a decent game class 40 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 the result is visible even the drawing on the helmet 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.840
 the coolest shot down some luck 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 there was such a thing that helped hear there 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.149
 feeling but he is generally version man i 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.879
 so I look and we even 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 and the code is the same that he had something 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.250
 wants very decent it's very nice 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 I like the man in communication 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.539
 i like real professionals and and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.489
 the most important thing 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.399
 good man is so very important 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 Vlasov almost safe especially me all his 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.380
 he is so confident yesterday himself 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.909
 act that did not give rival at all 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 no chance so sure of 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.979
 every moment he even here if I 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.409
 watched a few games there others have him 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 there were some so good in a safe that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 this was somewhere not sure you here he 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.810
 here is the very first throw and up 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.780
 last feel my sure u 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 a sense of superiority over it happens 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.490
 Akuterm I, too, was to such when until 81 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.549
 benefits the first period of the rope there hollowed 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.549
 it is necessary to assure bayans and confidence grew 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.070
 teams also need to point out here that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 all win victory is very important victory 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.579
 a couple of questions literally now 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.409
 fans regretfully remember that 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 first mozyakin diana region here 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.149
 plays what goal the duck scored and back in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.110
 Sochi and mozyakin not enough bobrovka on their 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 no insertion was made 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.050
 the most important point is all and the coach is envy 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.550
 you understand 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.550
 one thing the president of the hockey federation is not 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.790
 intervenes affairs here znarok main 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.830
 commander today but on the platform to find 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 wins team loses coach 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.150
 it has always been like this and big fights 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.150
 army wins 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.040
 if the commander loses so here 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.220
 all bets 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.410
 puts on a trainer his main word and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.530
 he believes someone or he thinks so 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.240
 that's what he is waiting for on the walls with the canal 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.820
 You said in Novogorsk before the championship 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.980
 the world that the medal is already good 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.570
 pretty or not yet i'm satisfied i'm 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.000
 I think that every medal today 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.280
 worthy of respect and bronze and silver and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.890
 bronze sprinkle what games well who's who 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.260
 good way athens bad to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 Canadians and Americans are always everything that his 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.460
 medals i want to say all all the teams 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.620
 worthy of a medal so of course every 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.450
 the team is keen to deserve to win 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.960
 the best golden hit is this goal 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
 each 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.570
 athlete you every medal in that year 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.070
 world champion we will now try i 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.320
 I think silver for us today too 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.450
 it is a success and the last question is 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.420
 Here is the impression that reproduces 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.970
 Canadian team here she scored 66 and 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.640
 victory day 9 have any status 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.650
 quebec yes i'm there is a run run 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.709
 generally with the team of Canada that they are very 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.940
 well start somewhere at the end of pass 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.800
 discipline let him down yesterday 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.800
 Americans virtually no removal 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.530
 it wasn't just for puck lag and 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.180
 the fact that he Holmes is generally opa and burn 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.959
 purely plays when it is american so 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.580
 fence when 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.830
 and canadians see they practically 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.110
 nowhere they are rude they play clean 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.060
 they play and here they play the game in 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.800
 our who we we are due to what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.590
 the rope is weak and plays a lot better 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.360
 they all always fal or Hamili and deleted 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.400
 we take advantage of beat it like 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.520
 most rule has always been fuck 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 and today they are sorry playing our 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.370
 hockey is very disciplined not tough 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.170
 correct by the rules and commands 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.210
 canada they are all young players understand 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.610
 they want to prove here 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.010
 young players Vitka because musician like 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.260
