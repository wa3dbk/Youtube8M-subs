00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello everyone and everyone looking for the channel I'm going 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.520
 start the manicure publish a video 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.860
 here it is the 234 calls paulo and fujian and 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.619
 this color is transparent zinho attention 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.170
 chinese indicated pink what is very good 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.570
 always this manicurist yes simpler 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.600
 so the collective stand looks good or 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 also for richer than francine 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.470
 It is also very good to have a kitchen 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.330
 Of these I confess there are not many of these 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.309
 because I like to see more 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.900
 experienced master module of courses 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.019
 so three dots is well to come now that 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.920
 Let's just let the stretch thing go. 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.049
 dry to continue on then I go 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.260
 use the beginning revealed the name is 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.000
 Porsche this is an average poison both to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
 see many curves or better a visa 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 of course if you do not have this mark with 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.059
 that other one stayed quiet our mark 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 or you can use another 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.430
 You prefer this, it's just a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.390
 idea of a manicure so much you can 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 make any changes I want 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.649
 I am listening to you, welcoming you 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.810
 transparent with only one layer and I'll 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.579
 apply a second layer let thing 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.969
 with oscar because I do not think it's 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.640
 enough 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:29.000
 then also apply a few wire 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.700
 and I chose a rather sÃ¡ filmezinho 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.859
 Fluoride white and pink short shape 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.320
 I really like to see pink with 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.509
 werder but if you do not have children 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.969
 may use a 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.549
 stamping has other flower in any 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.640
 posts they prefer or they can even you 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.679
 to draw and flowers 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.530
 the company already has a second tier of 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.359
 varnish that is already much busier 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.759
 And now I'm going to put the little 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.579
 The varnish is still wet so this is why 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.310
 just apply the movie already machico 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.439
 were you having to apply a cream 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 transparent first because otherwise the wire 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.939
 does not stick to the nail 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.429
 so much that I will apply the florets in 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.890
 I will apply two because I do not 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.060
 either I used it very full with flowers or 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.540
 that is stated 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.010
 so they say over 50 years and I 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.209
 also add a few lights 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.750
 I think the goal of how the legs 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.420
 anyone who does not have little 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.989
 to draw dots 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 but you have to have a kitchen of none 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.130
 act with hairs at risk have not yet been used and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.750
 so I'll take advantage to use 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.270
 today to see how it goes in the blood 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.390
 However, it is fitting that you stay until you 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.100
 You can leave like this if you want, but I 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
 I think these pearls lines gets more 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.440
 or even you make the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.680
 dots instead of pearls or leave 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.290
 Heusen only with the printing end Count 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.860
 the same day you drew 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.320
 I want to go just a few more questions 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 I still want to use a simple 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.950
 so I do not want to direct much more 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.480
 than this is not convenient, it seems so 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.880
 that he just apply a black lacquer 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.190
 Why wait for lights and also for 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.430
 that the end does not exit so Corn 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.430
 facility 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.430
 and when it comes, money is already here. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.410
 I think it was very simple to 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.530
 it was not too cute 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.480
 I liked a lot and I and this project 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 Thank you at least 26 Apr
