00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
needle so I am saying that you need to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
needle so I am saying that you need to
use<00:01:11.580> singer<00:01:11.970> needles<00:01:12.299> only<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.500> machine

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
use singer needles only in this machine

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
use singer needles only in this machine
and<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> difference<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> singer

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and there is a difference in the singer

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
and there is a difference in the singer
needles<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:17.130> brands<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.640> Schmidt's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
needles and other brands like Schmidt's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
needles and other brands like Schmidt's
or<00:01:19.580> organs<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> difference<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.650> top

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
or organs and the difference is the top

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.140 
or organs and the difference is the top
shaft<00:01:23.520> part<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.229> needle<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.970> for<00:01:26.970> some

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
shaft part of the needle and for some

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
shaft part of the needle and for some
reason<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.540> machine<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.170> partial<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> singer

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
reason this machine is partial to singer

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
reason this machine is partial to singer
