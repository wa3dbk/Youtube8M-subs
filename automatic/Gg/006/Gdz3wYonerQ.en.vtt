00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
said straw the axial handle sticking out

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.080 
said straw the axial handle sticking out
through<00:04:36.800> his<00:04:36.860> hand<00:04:38.320> now<00:04:39.320> around<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:40.190> each<00:04:40.760> of

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
through his hand now around on each of

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.480 
through his hand now around on each of
these<00:04:41.330> parts<00:04:41.720> here<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.620> should<00:04:42.800> draw<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.220> basic

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
these parts here you should draw a basic

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.670 
these parts here you should draw a basic
circle

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
circle

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.700 
circle
and<00:04:46.150> then<00:04:47.150> through<00:04:47.389> all<00:04:47.600> these<00:04:47.870> basic<00:04:48.320> circles

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
and then through all these basic circles

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.320 
and then through all these basic circles
you<00:04:48.830> need<00:04:49.009> to<00:04:49.130> draw<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:49.630> big<00:04:50.630> circle<00:04:52.300> do<00:04:53.300> a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
you need to draw one big circle do a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.689 
you need to draw one big circle do a
little<00:04:53.570> bit<00:04:53.750> more<00:04:53.960> detail<00:04:54.380> work<00:04:54.620> on<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:55.280> first

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
little bit more detail work on the first

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.710 
little bit more detail work on the first
circles<00:04:56.320> draw<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.380> smaller<00:04:57.740> ones<00:04:58.720> by

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
circles draw the smaller ones by

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.999 
circles draw the smaller ones by
darkening<00:05:00.169> their<00:05:00.350> outline<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.039> making<00:05:01.400> them

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
darkening their outline and making them

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.350 
darkening their outline and making them
three-dimensional<00:05:04.009> by<00:05:04.669> giving<00:05:05.000> them<00:05:05.150> two

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
three-dimensional by giving them two

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.310 
three-dimensional by giving them two
circles<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:07.539> then<00:05:08.539> draw<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.350> larger<00:05:10.190> circle

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
circles and then draw the larger circle

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.420 
circles and then draw the larger circle
going<00:05:12.320> through<00:05:12.560> all<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.740> them<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:14.860> each<00:05:15.860> of<00:05:16.190> the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
going through all of them on each of the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.760 
going through all of them on each of the
circles<00:05:16.639> is<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:19.090> little<00:05:20.090> blade<00:05:20.410> that<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.620> can

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
circles is a little blade that you can

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.430 
circles is a little blade that you can
just<00:05:21.979> draw<00:05:22.750> coming<00:05:23.750> off<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.990> circle

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.550 

expanding<00:05:27.440> out<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:28.720> then<00:05:29.720> trailing<00:05:30.139> back<00:05:30.320> in

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
expanding out and then trailing back in

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.360 
expanding out and then trailing back in
towards<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.039> center<00:05:32.680> there's<00:05:33.680> one<00:05:33.979> on<00:05:34.160> every

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
towards the center there's one on every

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.330 
towards the center there's one on every
circle<00:05:34.910> and<00:05:35.090> in<00:05:35.240> between<00:05:35.360> two<00:05:36.199> circles<00:05:39.340> and

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
circle and in between two circles and

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.430 
circle and in between two circles and
here's<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.759> basic<00:05:40.880> played<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.539> axel<00:05:42.050> always

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
here's the basic played that axel always

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.249 
here's the basic played that axel always
carries<00:05:43.389> because<00:05:44.389> of<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.660> length<00:05:44.870> of<00:05:45.080> this

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
carries because of the length of this

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.200 
carries because of the length of this
tutorial<00:05:45.470> i<00:05:45.949> have<00:05:46.220> divided<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.759> up<00:05:46.820> into<00:05:47.000> two

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
tutorial i have divided it up into two

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.260 
tutorial i have divided it up into two
parts<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:48.020> first<00:05:48.650> part<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:49.220> what<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.150> have

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
parts the first part is what you have

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.050 
parts the first part is what you have
just<00:05:50.300> now<00:05:50.720> seen<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:52.190> second<00:05:52.550> part<00:05:52.669> should

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
just now seen and the second part should

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.750 
just now seen and the second part should
be<00:05:53.180> coming<00:05:53.479> out<00:05:53.570> very<00:05:53.630> soon<00:05:54.080> afterwards<00:05:54.830> it

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
be coming out very soon afterwards it

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.290 
be coming out very soon afterwards it
should<00:05:56.090> be<00:05:56.449> out<00:05:57.440> very<00:05:57.470> soon<00:05:57.919> so<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:59.270> should

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
should be out very soon so you should

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.760 
should be out very soon so you should
