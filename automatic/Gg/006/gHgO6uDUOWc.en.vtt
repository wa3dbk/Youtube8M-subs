00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.660
 the wwe live tour in germany is 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 over and so were the 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 audience figures for the respective events 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.990
 published on 15 april in hamburg 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.289
 there were 9500 spectators on site on 17 april 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 in dortmund it was 8000 and on 18 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.730
 april in nuremberg it was 7000 of the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 wrestling observer has recently 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.040
 reports that mourinho very much 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.160
 probably from june 2015 at the wwe 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.530
 or be seen on nxp if he is at 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690
 nxp first occurs or directly into - there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 is still unclear but he will 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.420
 from june at the wwe expects a very 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.730
 very big message 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 lana and imame giants in the next 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.370
 months received a big push lana 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.469
 should either be a new manager of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 act on any superstar or one 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.539
 completely new role received and over 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.059
 Marie is currently training frequently as well 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.280
 very intense with like brian 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.320
 kendrick for your racing skills too 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 improve and she should come in the coming 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:19.229
 months into the wwe divas championship 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.880
 the picture plugged batista was added 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.460
 an interview about his new movie 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 asked if he could imagine in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 to return the wwe 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 he answered clearly he could 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.950
 Imagine that because he loves that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.890
 racing has already been with chris 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.350
 Jerry talks and says he likes too 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 the principle that christa rico persecutes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 that he often appears at home shot 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.799
 and not necessarily in the tv because you there 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 not in his opinion 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.869
 bad work of the creative team 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.470
 is bound and act much more freely 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 can 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 when batista is back in the wwe's 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 still unclear, however, is expected 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.030
 that he will be within the next year 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 once again returns to training 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.219
 Pope there was not completely out of the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.719
 Wwe has taken however seth rogens 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.000
 now a new Finnish and indeed 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.099
 which the deep face basta he yes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.989
 already at the rocking village sailors 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.970
 showed to end the match and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.550
 it is expected that seth will roll 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.280
 but simcorp still only shows 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.379
 on special occasions and this must 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.209
 then just to look something similar 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.420
 ok again oh that really out of everyone 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.560
 position can come and also completely out 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.560
 nothing comes
