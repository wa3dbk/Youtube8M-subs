the<00:01:21.119> history<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.570> gaming<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.470> every<00:01:22.830> year

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the history of gaming because every year

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:23.929 
the history of gaming because every year
they<00:01:23.100> say<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.759> absolutely

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
amazing and then it really isn't

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
amazing and then it really isn't
personal<00:01:27.119> preference<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.080> year<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.560> think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
cut some of the up close and personal

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
cut some of the up close and personal
things<00:01:41.040> aren't<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.880> crisp<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.630> look<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
things aren't as crisp they look a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.810 
things aren't as crisp they look a
little<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.530> fuzzy<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> edges<00:01:44.640> as

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
little you know fuzzy on the edges as

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
little you know fuzzy on the edges as
far<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> players<00:01:46.110> went<00:01:46.470> last

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
far as some of the players went last

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
far as some of the players went last
year<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:48.119> thought<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> few<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
year and I thought there was a few you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.230 
year and I thought there was a few you
know<00:01:49.439> areas<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> improve<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.119> they

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
know areas to improve and I think they

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.429 
know areas to improve and I think they
did<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> most<00:01:51.720> part<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> haven't

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
did for the most part you know I haven't

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.870 
did for the most part you know I haven't
done<00:01:52.619> any<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.070> game<00:01:53.369> modes<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> know

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
done any of the other game modes I know

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420 
done any of the other game modes I know
they<00:01:54.060> added<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> training<00:01:54.869> camp<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.970 
and I don't know why I did it you know
considering<00:02:15.540> how<00:02:15.810> easy<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> layup

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
considering how easy it is to do a layup

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
considering how easy it is to do a layup
and<00:02:17.190> things<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.030> there's<00:02:18.989> not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and things like that so there's not

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.570 
and things like that so there's not
going<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> lot<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.769> finesse<00:02:19.980> moves<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
going to be a lot of finesse moves in

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
last year 2010 I actually thought the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.120 
last year 2010 I actually thought the
graphics<00:05:16.260> were<00:05:16.410> better<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.890> played<00:05:17.100> a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
graphics were better and it played a

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.590

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.450 
little better you know I know some
people<00:05:18.630> disagree<00:05:18.930> but<00:05:19.830> that's<00:05:20.010> because<00:05:20.190> I

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
people disagree but that's because I

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.159 
people disagree but that's because I
prefer<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:20.790> shoot<00:05:21.060> with<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.570> face<00:05:21.750> buttons
