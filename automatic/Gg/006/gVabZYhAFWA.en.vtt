55 kilos and that's essentially taking

55 kilos and that's essentially taking

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
55 kilos off the front axle so it's a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.930 
55 kilos off the front axle so it's a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.420 
lot lighter at the front it's keener to
turn<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.800> because<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.950> less<00:03:20.190> weight

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430

the<00:03:21.060> 2-liter<00:03:21.600> turbo<00:03:22.020> still<00:03:22.380> gets<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:22.890> goes

the 2-liter turbo still gets up and goes

the 2-liter turbo still gets up and goes
pretty<00:03:23.459> well<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.890> BMW<00:03:26.459> 4<00:03:26.700> Series<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.450> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
