00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.600
 first principle 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 your life does not represent real life 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.169
 and in that way 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.239
 in herat largely by my family 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:19.570
 contradictions knowledge beliefs religions fears prejudice 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.339
 superstitions reviews 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.069
 points of view 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.069
 and complemented by the experiences of your own life 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.589
 if you analyze it very well you will realize that I sherry a by-product of what 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.609
 They thought they said they did others for you without asking 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 that your advice and religion or your beliefs vary 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.360
 2 according to the truth without another sociocultural context 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.900
 have you ever wondered what your beliefs would be 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 if you were born in jordan 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.370
 In Israel 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.770
 in India 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.750
 or in Tibet 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.390
 they would probably be very different from what you have now 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.910
 so 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.070
 what makes you different 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.660
 the package of beliefs that they deposited in your mind 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.000
 your pieces with what you know 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 and maybe what you think 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.760
 but the information that is in your mind was strategically placed there in the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.880
 the course of your life since you were a child 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.829
 interiors concepts 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.279
 that are part of your deepest beliefs and that never position yourself 

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:38.759
 assuming 100% of its truthfulness just because everyone believes it 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 that's why your world become what I felt 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 and teach what they teach you 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.340
 in an endless educational system 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.720
 that at all costs 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 I seek my training for your purposes 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.900
 when the uniform 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.140
 he announced a virtue 80 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.230
 you dress up what you need 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.410
 and everything you say are borrowed concepts what they say to the public 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.530
 or listen to that day in a book 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.399
 forgetting that you are an intelligent being 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.199
 individual 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.789
 or are you one of those who believe that they were born on a planet designed for 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.929
 life to fulfill only one cycle such as that of the 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.559
 animals 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.279
 do 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.929
 grow 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.899
 reproduce and die 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:29.499
 your reality of the gum 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.499
 is nothing more than a set of mental programs without 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 largely to have been directed by the media 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.829
 that prevent you from thinking clearly 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.179
 that's why you do not accept what does not fit in tucumÃ¡n 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:47.669
 and in most cases you do not agree with the bubble of others 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.149
 that is why humanity is divided 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.849
 and always will be 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.849
 while we are not in a state of collective consciousness 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.189
 arrogance does not let you see beyond what is in your limited and 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.069
 conformist world 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.319
 because everyone thinks they are right 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.839
 and they have it with a single one inside their scarf 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.979
 and it's easier 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.869
 to refuse 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.169
 what you call sense 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.429
 rs your jail 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.179
 however comfortable and luxurious it may be 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.619
 and so you consider yourself different and independent 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 you are still inside 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.789
 the worst of all 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:36.749
 is that you do not realize and when your interior through your mind tries to 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.749
 get free 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.519
 if still not enough 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.330
 They fill you with vices and make you believe that this is living life 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.609
 the power to pursue a world of illusion 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.949
 the one that society has imposed 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.949
 to consider yourself worthwhile 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.899
 if you are looking for few 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:07.519
 as the most candid goal to fulfill within the sixties or seventies 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:09.679
 although with luck 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.079
 I could write 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.419
 before the undeniable truth that intelligence offers 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.759
 not the belief 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.689
 the intelligence that will come to contend 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.599
 the outcast and withered argument of the fools elinor before 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.129
 blind 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.599
 blind guides it's time to see a new reality that can only be seen 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.629
 with the eyes of intelligence 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.860
 there is the real battle that must be written 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 the one that overcomes the ignorance nor my defeat the fanaticism 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.289
 the religions did what they had to do to survive now and 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.879
 they are dying and there is no room left for fables of paradises and purgatories 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.539
 of the traffickers of the fed
