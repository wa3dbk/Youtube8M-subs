the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.619> yelled<00:01:32.010> I<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> an

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the way that I yelled I use a more of an

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.289 
the way that I yelled I use a more of an
east-to-west<00:01:33.780> motion<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> actually

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
east-to-west motion and if you actually

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.060 
east-to-west motion and if you actually
took<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.540> pen<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.080> drew<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> call<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
took a pen and drew it on the call it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.070 
took a pen and drew it on the call it
would<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.580> somewhat<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.360> fishing<00:01:39.930> hook

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
would look somewhat like a fishing hook

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.840 
would look somewhat like a fishing hook
like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.440> brute<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.860> small<00:01:41.159> bream<00:01:41.490> hook<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
like a brute like a small bream hook the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.770 
like a brute like a small bream hook the
circles<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.840> sound<00:01:47.180> almost<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.600> you're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
circles they sound almost like you're

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
circles they sound almost like you're
saying<00:01:48.930> wow<00:01:49.259> wow<00:01:49.530> wow<00:01:49.830> wow<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.399> you're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
saying wow wow wow wow when you're

saying wow wow wow wow when you're
calling<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.690> bream<00:01:52.020> hook<00:01:52.320> motion<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
calling with the bream hook motion you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.270 
calling with the bream hook motion you
get<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.420> realistic<00:01:54.810> sound<00:01:55.289> alright<00:01:56.130> here

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
get a more realistic sound alright here

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.740 
get a more realistic sound alright here
we're<00:01:56.369> gonna<00:01:56.490> hear<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.789> here<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> what

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
we're gonna hear it here is that what

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.219 
we're gonna hear it here is that what
most<00:01:57.990> everybody<00:01:58.380> uses<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> circle<00:02:03.229> all

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
most everybody uses in the circle all

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
most everybody uses in the circle all
right<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.590> mean<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.190> will<00:02:05.429> keel<00:02:05.610> turkeys<00:02:06.119> but

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
right I mean that will keel turkeys but

right I mean that will keel turkeys but
there<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.470> times<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.340> more

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
there are times that you need to be more
