00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'll make a Roman broccoli pie with 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.139
 a pecorino and pancetta sauce that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.299
 also takes up the recipes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 classic Roman if water starts this way 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.670
 boiling slightly salted and inside 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.870
 the tops and leaves of the star broccoli 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.580
 slightly acid the water with the vinegar 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 of wine and I cook for about 5 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.830
 minutes 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the meantime it warm the milk to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.880
 will be used to make a small payment 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.530
 as soon as he puts them there they are still cooked 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 crunches drain well in a bowl 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.910
 and I take off all the water that remains the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 I am slightly intimidated by the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.360
 meanwhile I prepare in roux for the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 béchamel then burra on the bottom 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.990
 just melted add the flour beat 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.060
 beautiful with the whisk to cook the 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.930
 flour and do not create lumps and then when 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.730
 hot milk 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.760
 I add a pinch of salt and incorporates 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
 two elements in a minute and a half 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.200
 the béchamel begins at the races ago 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 the bubbles and then to remove from the fire 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.230
 scent with grated nutmeg to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.730
 moment this will give a lot of scent not 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.410
 take the powdered grater to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.060
 example spices at the moment and then 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.950
 it's time for my broccoli to be 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.570
 slightly warmed up so I go to 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.800
 crush them roughly because 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.240
 serve the lexicon would put a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.190
 compound too homogeneous and smooth instead 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.130
 so it remains a little crunchy and more 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.330
 rough and collect the basin 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.070
 in the meantime, I'm sweating 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.310
 pancetta Piacentina in the pan of the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.900
 because of the fat they become crunchy if 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.409
 it's just broccoli flavor with salt 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.789
 pepper 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.259
 I add the béchamel that will give the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.240
 fluidity attitude is composed of 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.640
 too much with them is too dry and then 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.079
 I read with the eggs and slam the nose for 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.759
 I have intimidated this otherwise 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.829
 place would be cooked with the heat of the 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.630
 broccoli add the two cheeses 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.909
 grated both pecorino and grana 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.929
 we mix everything well 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.459
 I ride my bacon so that you 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.250
 cook evenly and in the meantime 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.109
 and in addition the stencils these are in 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.520
 silicone then non-stick or if 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.140
 you have such as aluminum slightly 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 otherwise buttered and floured 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.369
 served I put the leaves like 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.879
 decoration and I go to the oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.289
 for about 16 18 million 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.610
 meanwhile, it seems a little bit of sauce 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.679
 since he loved the cream list then 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.989
 fresh grated pecorino cream and a 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.250
 a little pepper should only be reduced 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:06.250
 in the pan 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.810
 the dish is practically with the sanction 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 fluid mara will be mirrored 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.160
 on the plate the cake is very warm heart 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.780
 the sardine that is creamy and crispy outside 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.849
 on the tasty side and just two 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.420
 sprouts optional for decorating and 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.720
 voila 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.720
 be ready 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.910
 they seek each other 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 let's play 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.850
 they seek each other
