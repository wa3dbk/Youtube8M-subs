00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
Hello everyone
World Rubber Market

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.630
Gucchy.
The people of this time also table tennis Answers

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.660
Thank you
Today's theme is here

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.690
About crescent Serve
I think to try to do

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.610
If this is called what
Of reverse horizontal rotation of the fore

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.590
It becomes service
If master this

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.390
Actually, off easily
The fast reverse lateral rotation Serve

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.100
You will be able to learn
So the yg Serve

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.730
Definitely remember than
Better here crescent Serve

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.170
The rotation of the reverse lateral rotation
I think that the kana easy strongly

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.170
Than the amount of rotation entrainment Serve
I put out strongly

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.900
Difficulty is simple
It is possible to get even sharpness

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.330
The two have been completed Tteyuu
You will serve

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.980
In three person of this procedure
You are doing but to Sasa~tsu

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.720
Feel please see why
First crescent Serve

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.270
Here of the procedure is the first one
Attitude of first one first body

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.950
Rather than the surface
In attitude yelling put the usual body

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.420
I do the crescent Serve
Please be in Fu Tteyuu

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.580
Doing this
When do the crescent Serve

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.360
This is also different
Such as narrowing squatting Serve

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.220
Because it becomes to feel
Difficulty will up

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.430
So it is always of Saab
Facing over there body

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.620
And entrainment Saab, etc.
In how to enter the same attitude

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.800
I put out a crescent Serve
When you do so

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.080
In combination with entrainment Saab
There is a very effective

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.700
If you think you entrainment it's Saab
Wow intense and fast spotted out

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.490
And horizontal rotation is at once Do~tsu
The Fu Tteyuu flew

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.640
Since it may become
Same as how to enter and entrainment Serve

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.470
And ordinary Serve
By the same goes way

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.470
Please do the crescent Serve

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.049
Procedure is the second
Now Second of racket Kad

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.260
Here excessive
That it Tteyuu turn to the other party

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.230
Please try it
I turn excessive to opponent

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.290
It is this kind of feeling
Since the case of the right am in there

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.900
Of racket is here
I turn this excessively opponent

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.170
Tteyuu I feel
Not is a tip

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.170
Here is Kad is here and here
Please Towards excessive

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.810
Procedure is the third of
The third is the right-hand side of the ball this time

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.120
Feeling to chop
Please be slashed

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.159
This is the last and most important
It captures the right side of the ball

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.700
Chop is such feeling
Chop chop

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.609
It is this kind of feeling
And chop the right side of the ball

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.980
The right-hand side of the chop ball
Chop I slash at that time

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.249
What I feel
Rather not you stop Cut

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:40.209
The slash in chop
Abutted against strike

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.249
In I feel it 's
Please try it

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:49.249
When you do so
This is the completion of the crescent Serve

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.480
The Serve
When do in this kind of Fu

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.799
And I'm hella off
I ran out and Butsu~tsu

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.750
I put out a reverse lateral rotation Serve
And because it does not use the wrist

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.000
yg about Saab
To is not difficult

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Than entrainment Serve
Since the swing space is large

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.810
It is so big
Back swing

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.250
Since taking easy
Than entrainment Serve

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.280
Amount of rotation is large
Like a narrowing squatting Serve

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.690
Also be crowded into the body
The Ya burden of foot because it is not

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.000
Return after Saab
There is no also be delayed

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.950
So amazing fine
Crescent Saab

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.040
And I've been reasonable
Finally, I'm a bonus

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190
It captures the right side of the ball
I said to me to chop

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.370
At this time
The bottom right of the ball

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.530
The horizontal under rotation and to capture
The upper-right corner of the ball

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.540
When you as capture
You lie on a rotating

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.760
So crescent Saab
Also distinguish of rotation

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.250
And to be easily
Among the reverse lateral rotation Serve

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.810
Difficulty Even if you're very easy
Than the amount of rotation entrainment Serve

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.000
By the Tteyuu put out strongly
I think innovative kana

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.970
Is worth to incorporate all means
It is a very high crescent Serve

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.350
Please try it and if good
THANK YOU
