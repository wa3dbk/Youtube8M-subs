separate the two red jacks run inside

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.660 
separate the two red jacks run inside
the<00:00:09.740> deck<00:00:11.860> and<00:00:13.539> explain<00:00:14.539> the<00:00:14.690> spectator<00:00:15.049> that

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
these jacks are gonna be important later

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.460 
these jacks are gonna be important later
on<00:00:19.040> I<00:00:19.400> hand<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.060> deck<00:00:20.240> over<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.540> him<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:20.960> soft

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
on I hand the deck over the him to soft

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.010 
on I hand the deck over the him to soft
land<00:00:21.680> cut<00:00:21.890> as<00:00:22.820> many<00:00:23.090> times<00:00:23.270> as<00:00:23.390> he<00:00:23.570> wants<00:00:23.600> and

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
land cut as many times as he wants and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.050 
land cut as many times as he wants and
while<00:00:24.890> he's<00:00:25.040> doing<00:00:25.190> that<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:25.490> explain<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.030> him

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
while he's doing that I explain to him

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.140 
while he's doing that I explain to him
that<00:00:26.240> I've<00:00:27.080> always<00:00:27.410> been<00:00:27.560> trying<00:00:27.770> to<00:00:28.100> push<00:00:28.910> my

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
that I've always been trying to push my

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.409 
that I've always been trying to push my
sleight<00:00:29.450> of<00:00:29.480> hand<00:00:29.980> abilities<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.190> limit

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
sleight of hand abilities to the limit

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.720 
sleight of hand abilities to the limit
and<00:00:32.419> what<00:00:33.079> I'm<00:00:33.170> about<00:00:33.200> show<00:00:33.649> him<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.039> one<00:00:34.609> of

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
and what I'm about show him is one of

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.479 
and what I'm about show him is one of
these<00:00:34.909> experiments<00:00:37.659> so<00:00:38.659> he's<00:00:39.050> finished

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
these experiments so he's finished

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.950 
these experiments so he's finished
soughing<00:00:40.519> and<00:00:40.879> cutting<00:00:41.269> I<00:00:41.449> figured<00:00:41.839> they'd

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
soughing and cutting I figured they'd

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.500 
soughing and cutting I figured they'd
back<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:43.309> asked<00:00:43.429> him<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.879> touch<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.329> back

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
back and I asked him to touch the back

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.939 
back and I asked him to touch the back
of<00:00:44.539> any<00:00:44.749> card<00:00:45.019> as<00:00:45.199> I<00:00:45.319> go<00:00:45.499> through<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.769> deck

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
of any card as I go through the deck

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.700 
of any card as I go through the deck
like<00:00:46.100> Greece<00:00:46.339> so<00:00:46.969> let's<00:00:47.479> assume<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.780> he

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
like Greece so let's assume that he

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.770 
like Greece so let's assume that he
touches<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.640> card<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.989> ask<00:00:51.260> him<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.859> remember

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
touches this card so ask him to remember

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.090 
touches this card so ask him to remember
this<00:00:53.780> card<00:00:54.079> it's<00:00:54.859> gonna<00:00:54.979> be<00:00:55.159> his<00:00:55.339> card<00:00:56.649> now<00:00:57.649> I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.789 

said<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.370> jacks<00:01:02.120> are<00:01:02.269> gonna<00:01:02.420> help<00:01:02.629> me

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
said that the jacks are gonna help me

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.439 
said that the jacks are gonna help me
later<00:01:03.799> on<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.250> actually<00:01:05.030> they're<00:01:05.150> gonna<00:01:05.239> help

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
later on and actually they're gonna help

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.140 
later on and actually they're gonna help
me<00:01:05.630> find<00:01:05.870> his<00:01:06.500> card<00:01:06.800> from<00:01:07.520> inside<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> deck

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
me find his card from inside the deck

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.780 
me find his card from inside the deck
but<00:01:08.360> first<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:09.140> have<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:10.190> lose<00:01:10.340> his<00:01:10.550> card

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
but first we have to lose his card

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.290 
but first we have to lose his card
somewhere<00:01:11.510> in<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.810> deck<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.230> place<00:01:12.470> it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
somewhere in the deck so I place it

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.110 
somewhere in the deck so I place it
roughly<00:01:14.300> in<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.540> middle<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.920> asked<00:01:16.130> him<00:01:16.310> to

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
roughly in the middle and I asked him to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.630 
roughly in the middle and I asked him to
square<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> deck<00:01:17.630> up<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.980> make<00:01:19.160> sure<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.490> his

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
square the deck up to make sure that his

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.720 
square the deck up to make sure that his
card<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.030> lost<00:01:20.830> now<00:01:21.830> I<00:01:22.070> want<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.400> build<00:01:22.550> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
card is lost now I want to build the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.180 
card is lost now I want to build the
jacks<00:01:23.000> somehow<00:01:23.960> inside<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.410> deck<00:01:24.620> but<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:24.890> want

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
jacks somehow inside the deck but I want

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.490 
jacks somehow inside the deck but I want
to<00:01:25.280> bury<00:01:25.460> them<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.120> exact<00:01:26.570> point<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.230> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
to bury them in the exact point that the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.640 
to bury them in the exact point that the
spectator<00:01:27.890> wants<00:01:28.220> me<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:28.940> asked<00:01:29.300> him<00:01:29.650> to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
spectator wants me to so I asked him to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.720 
spectator wants me to so I asked him to
give<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.860> deck<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> cut<00:01:31.750> somewhere<00:01:33.580> at<00:01:34.580> least

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
give the deck a cut somewhere at least

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.610 
give the deck a cut somewhere at least
the<00:01:34.910> jacks<00:01:35.150> at<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.720> point<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
the jacks at the point that the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.260 
the jacks at the point that the
spectator<00:01:36.980> cut<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.340> deck<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.880> complete

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
spectator cut the deck and I complete

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.900 
spectator cut the deck and I complete
complete<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.900> cut<00:01:39.080> now<00:01:39.380> at<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.460> point<00:01:40.670> it's

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
complete the cut now at this point it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.940 
complete the cut now at this point it's
obvious<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.510> can't<00:01:41.810> possibly<00:01:41.990> know<00:01:42.260> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
obvious that I can't possibly know the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.790 
obvious that I can't possibly know the
exact<00:01:43.220> position<00:01:43.400> his<00:01:44.330> guard<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.960> actually<00:01:45.620> I

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
exact position his guard and actually I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500 
exact position his guard and actually I
can't<00:01:46.250> possibly<00:01:46.370> know<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.880> exact<00:01:47.150> position

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
can't possibly know the exact position

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.950 
can't possibly know the exact position
of<00:01:47.570> any<00:01:47.780> card<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.800> deck<00:01:49.750> except<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.840> two

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
of any card in the deck except the two

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.020 
of any card in the deck except the two
jacks<00:01:51.230> which<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.800> know<00:01:51.920> are<00:01:52.100> somewhere<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
jacks which I know are somewhere in the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.270 
jacks which I know are somewhere in the
middle<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:53.990> guy<00:01:54.170> could<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.040> half

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
middle this guy could be in this half

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.330 
middle this guy could be in this half
over<00:01:55.520> here<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:56.510> half<00:01:56.750> over<00:01:56.990> here<00:01:57.260> anyway

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
over here and this half over here anyway

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.060 
over here and this half over here anyway
I'm<00:01:58.400> just<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.690> square<00:02:00.080> very<00:02:00.980> slowly<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
I'm just going to square very slowly and

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.340 
I'm just going to square very slowly and
as<00:02:04.070> fair<00:02:04.909> as<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.150> can

as fair as I can
the<00:02:07.070> deck<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:08.590> now<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.890> were<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.070> pick<00:02:10.340> up

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
the deck and now if I were to pick up

the deck and now if I were to pick up
the<00:02:10.610> deck<00:02:10.790> some<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.270> might<00:02:11.420> accuse<00:02:11.720> me<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
the deck some of you might accuse me of
