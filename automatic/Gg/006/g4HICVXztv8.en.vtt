00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hi guys it's AG Zoe Eve and today I just

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.230 
hi guys it's AG Zoe Eve and today I just
came<00:00:04.740> from<00:00:04.920> Target<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.609> mom<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.180> she

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
came from Target with my mom and she

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.129 
came from Target with my mom and she
surprised<00:00:07.020> me<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.929> had<00:00:09.929> been

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
surprised me with this I had been

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
surprised me with this I had been
looking<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> while<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
looking at this for a while and I

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.120 
looking at this for a while and I
thought<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.750> retired<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.440> haven't<00:00:13.799> seen<00:00:13.980> it

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
thought it was retired I haven't seen it

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.939 
thought it was retired I haven't seen it
in<00:00:14.340> our<00:00:15.330> generation<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.320> any<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> targets

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
in our generation at any of the targets

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.019 
in our generation at any of the targets
and<00:00:18.470> I'd<00:00:19.470> wanted<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> long<00:00:20.460> time<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and I'd wanted it for a long time but I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
and I'd wanted it for a long time but I
figured<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.380> retired<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
figured up they probably just retired it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.230 
figured up they probably just retired it
and<00:00:23.400> I'm<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.320> don't<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.279> any<00:00:26.699> are

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and I'm really not I don't have any are

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
and I'm really not I don't have any are
generation<00:00:27.840> things<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> thought<00:00:29.130> this

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
generation things but I thought this

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.550 
generation things but I thought this
just<00:00:29.640> looked<00:00:30.179> from<00:00:30.720> YouTube<00:00:31.080> I've<00:00:31.199> seen<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> lot

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
just looked from YouTube I've seen a lot

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
just looked from YouTube I've seen a lot
of<00:00:31.679> people<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.880> thought<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of people with it I just thought it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
of people with it I just thought it
looked<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.390> such<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> cute<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
looked like such a cute set I think it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.590 
looked like such a cute set I think it
was<00:00:35.219> 1699<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.890> honestly<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.270> don't<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
was 1699 which honestly I don't know a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
was 1699 which honestly I don't know a
little<00:00:39.989> pricey<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.770> our<00:00:40.890> generation<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
little pricey for our generation but

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
little pricey for our generation but
maybe<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.250> can't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
maybe it's not I don't know I can't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
maybe it's not I don't know I can't
decide<00:00:45.120> I'll<00:00:45.539> decide<00:00:46.110> once<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.890> open

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

so the first thing is the suitcase and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.130 
so the first thing is the suitcase and
it<00:01:06.140> looks<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.770> slips<00:01:07.130> open<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.880> way
