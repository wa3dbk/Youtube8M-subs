the<00:04:12.220> fire<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:13.739> once<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:14.860> get<00:04:15.010> went<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.400> have

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
the fire so once you get went to have

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.569 
the fire so once you get went to have
something<00:04:15.730> going<00:04:16.919> figure<00:04:17.919> going<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.400> there

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
something going figure going in there

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.370 
something going figure going in there
that<00:04:19.000> helps<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.389> get<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.049> light<00:04:20.260> up

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
that helps to get it that light up

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
that helps to get it that light up
faster<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.979> i'll<00:04:24.130> definitely<00:04:24.520> heat<00:04:24.639> up<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
faster and i'll definitely heat up the
