00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
with a flat tire so I figured I'd help

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
with a flat tire so I figured I'd help
him<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.649> change<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:35.700> I've<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.059> his

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
him out change it because I've got his

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
him out change it because I've got his
snow<00:00:36.540> tires<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.110> never<00:00:37.260> put<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> year

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

warmer to make you can call it man and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.670 
warmer to make you can call it man and
is<00:01:56.710> howling<00:01:57.710> again<00:02:02.230> that's<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.320> little

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680

silicone<00:02:04.130> inside<00:02:04.610> here<00:02:05.020> not<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.200> much<00:02:06.320> to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
silicone inside here not so much to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.250 
silicone inside here not so much to
lubricate<00:02:06.800> cleaner<00:02:13.810> you're<00:02:14.810> not<00:02:14.930> supposed<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
lubricate cleaner you're not supposed to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
lubricate cleaner you're not supposed to
lubricate<00:02:15.500> transpose<00:02:16.490> drive<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.660> got

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
lubricate transpose drive but you got

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.460 
lubricate transpose drive but you got
rust<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> threads<00:02:19.630> put<00:02:20.630> something<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
rust on the threads put something on and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:34.600 
rust on the threads put something on and
yeah<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:21.890> changes<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> torque<00:02:22.550> reading<00:02:33.610> goes

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
yeah it changes the torque reading goes

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.010 
yeah it changes the torque reading goes
to<00:02:34.730> doing<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> cross<00:02:35.380> cross<00:02:36.380> pattern<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
to doing the cross cross pattern to the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:55.750 
to doing the cross cross pattern to the
back<00:02:39.850> that's<00:02:40.850> too<00:02:41.060> fancy<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.510> me<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:54.760> we
