00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
remain innovative and some of that is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.190 
remain innovative and some of that is
also<00:03:48.230> about<00:03:48.500> putting<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:48.980> right<00:03:49.190> tools<00:03:49.550> at

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
where do you think you can take the

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.679 
where do you think you can take the
business<00:06:19.099> using<00:06:19.759> technology<00:06:20.330> and<00:06:20.419> then<00:06:20.509> in

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689 
business using technology and then in

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.980 
business using technology and then in
the<00:06:20.750> next<00:06:20.870> kind<00:06:21.050> of<00:06:21.169> a<00:06:21.319> few<00:06:21.800> years<00:06:22.039> so<00:06:22.879> we're<00:06:23.870> in

literally own every single line of
source<00:06:27.289> code<00:06:27.379> in<00:06:27.800> our<00:06:28.009> business<00:06:29.229> we've

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
source code in our business we've

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.529 
source code in our business we've
already<00:06:30.439> just<00:06:30.830> redeployed<00:06:31.430> that<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.909> open<00:06:32.419> our

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
already just redeployed that to open our

non-food business we've always sold

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.339 
non-food business we've always sold
non-food<00:06:35.389> actually<00:06:35.779> but<00:06:35.900> now<00:06:36.050> it's

non-food actually but now it's

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.800 
non-food actually but now it's
broadening<00:06:36.800> and<00:06:37.310> we<00:06:37.490> have<00:06:37.610> a<00:06:37.639> new<00:06:37.909> warehouse

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
broadening and we have a new warehouse

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.510 
broadening and we have a new warehouse
that<00:06:39.080> runs<00:06:39.289> in<00:06:39.560> automated<00:06:40.129> warehouse<00:06:40.370> that

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
that runs in automated warehouse that

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.170 
that runs in automated warehouse that
runs<00:06:40.729> in<00:06:40.879> Wellen<00:06:41.210> just<00:06:41.810> doing<00:06:42.080> non-food<00:06:43.180> with

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
runs in Wellen just doing non-food with

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.070 
runs in Wellen just doing non-food with
robots<00:06:44.569> flying<00:06:44.810> around<00:06:44.990> place<00:06:45.229> and<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:46.250> is<00:06:47.150> a

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
robots flying around place and that is a

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.369 
robots flying around place and that is a
key<00:06:48.409> the<00:06:49.069> first<00:06:49.759> reuse<00:06:50.479> of<00:06:50.690> our<00:06:50.810> technology<00:06:51.110> if

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
key the first reuse of our technology if

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.439 
key the first reuse of our technology if
you<00:06:51.440> like<00:06:51.620> the<00:06:52.610> deal<00:06:52.789> that<00:06:53.000> we<00:06:53.089> signed<00:06:53.300> last

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
you like the deal that we signed last

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.329 
you like the deal that we signed last
week<00:06:53.569> is<00:06:54.020> about<00:06:54.319> the<00:06:54.620> first<00:06:54.860> step<00:06:55.129> in

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
week is about the first step in

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.369 
week is about the first step in
monetizing<00:06:55.849> if<00:06:56.360> you<00:06:56.479> like<00:06:56.629> that<00:06:56.810> technology

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:57.379 
monetizing if you like that technology

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:58.719 
monetizing if you like that technology
in<00:06:57.500> a<00:06:57.589> new<00:06:57.770> stream<00:06:58.099> and<00:06:58.310> that's<00:06:58.430> obviously

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
in a new stream and that's obviously

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:00.670 
in a new stream and that's obviously
very<00:06:58.789> exciting<00:06:59.270> but<00:07:00.050> then<00:07:00.169> looking<00:07:00.469> further

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
very exciting but then looking further

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.890 
very exciting but then looking further
ahead<00:07:00.919> we<00:07:01.520> you<00:07:01.849> know<00:07:01.969> we<00:07:02.120> made<00:07:02.270> it<00:07:02.419> clear<00:07:02.659> when

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
ahead we you know we made it clear when

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.219 
ahead we you know we made it clear when
we<00:07:02.930> floated<00:07:03.440> in<00:07:03.560> 2010<00:07:04.339> that<00:07:05.060> you<00:07:05.719> don't<00:07:05.930> put

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
we floated in 2010 that you don't put

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.769 
we floated in 2010 that you don't put
this<00:07:06.469> much<00:07:06.830> investment<00:07:07.729> into<00:07:08.240> the<00:07:08.389> solution

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:08.779 
this much investment into the solution

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.600 
this much investment into the solution
that<00:07:08.810> we've<00:07:08.990> built<00:07:09.319> jut<00:07:10.099> if<00:07:10.219> you're<00:07:10.370> just

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
that we've built jut if you're just

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.459 
that we've built jut if you're just
interested<00:07:10.819> in<00:07:11.389> sort<00:07:11.689> of<00:07:11.719> groceries<00:07:12.289> in<00:07:12.409> the

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:12.469 
interested in sort of groceries in the

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:14.260 
interested in sort of groceries in the
UK<00:07:12.740> so<00:07:12.800> we<00:07:13.159> have<00:07:13.339> aspirations<00:07:13.819> that<00:07:14.120> are

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
UK so we have aspirations that are

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.579 
UK so we have aspirations that are
definitely<00:07:14.479> on<00:07:14.900> these<00:07:15.080> shores<00:07:15.349> and<00:07:16.180> that's<00:07:17.180> a

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:17.589 
definitely on these shores and that's a

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.290 
definitely on these shores and that's a
that's<00:07:18.589> really<00:07:19.009> important<00:07:19.669> when<00:07:19.759> it<00:07:19.819> comes<00:07:19.909> to

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
that's really important when it comes to

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.129 
that's really important when it comes to
the<00:07:20.389> cloud<00:07:20.659> and<00:07:21.050> about<00:07:21.349> being<00:07:21.680> able<00:07:21.919> to<00:07:23.139> deploy

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
the cloud and about being able to deploy

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.920 
the cloud and about being able to deploy
our<00:07:24.310> technology<00:07:25.310> in<00:07:25.759> a<00:07:26.000> bridgehead<00:07:26.270> you<00:07:26.810> know

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
our technology in a bridgehead you know

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.089 
our technology in a bridgehead you know
in<00:07:27.110> other<00:07:27.199> countries<00:07:27.560> without<00:07:27.710> necessarily

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.099 
in other countries without necessarily

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.129 
in other countries without necessarily
having<00:07:28.580> to<00:07:28.879> open<00:07:29.060> data<00:07:29.479> centers<00:07:29.990> and

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
having to open data centers and

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.300 
having to open data centers and
everything<00:07:30.349> else<00:07:30.500> goes<00:07:30.650> with<00:07:30.680> that<00:07:30.889> on<00:07:31.129> day

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
everything else goes with that on day

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.200 
everything else goes with that on day
one

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.270
