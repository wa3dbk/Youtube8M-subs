at<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.710> make<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.950> difference<00:00:07.980> between

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
at I can make the difference between

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.270 
at I can make the difference between
looking<00:00:08.730> polished<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.480> just<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.280> today

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
looking polished and just so so today

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.620 
looking polished and just so so today
we're<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.790> talking<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
we're going to be talking about one of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.480 
we're going to be talking about one of
the<00:00:12.780> most<00:00:12.960> distinguished<00:00:13.349> knots<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.250> full

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the most distinguished knots the full

cross the wide end over the narrow end

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
cross the wide end over the narrow end
to<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> left<00:00:26.930> bring<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> wide<00:00:28.260> end<00:00:28.289> around

to the left bring the wide end around

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.900 
to the left bring the wide end around
and<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:30.000> through<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> loop<00:00:34.640> bring<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> wide

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

placing the wide end on the right with
the<00:00:46.469> inside<00:00:47.160> facing<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:49.250> make<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> bridge<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the inside facing out make a bridge and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990 
the inside facing out make a bridge and
then<00:00:51.809> bring<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> wide<00:00:52.410> end<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:53.070> through<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
then bring the wide end up through the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.599 
then bring the wide end up through the
back<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.120> through<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> knot<00:00:59.340> in

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
back and then down through the knot in

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.830 
back and then down through the knot in
front<00:01:01.550> again<00:01:02.550> hold<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.199> front<00:01:05.479> pinching<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
front again hold the front pinching the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
front again hold the front pinching the
wide<00:01:07.080> end<00:01:07.220> under<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> knot<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> holding<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
wide end under the knot and holding the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
wide end under the knot and holding the
back<00:01:09.630> narrow<00:01:10.140> side<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.189> slide<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.610> up

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
back narrow side as you slide it up

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.480 
back narrow side as you slide it up
towards<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.450> neck<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> shape<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> tie<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
towards the neck and shape the tie this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:43.710 
towards the neck and shape the tie this
will<00:01:14.729> create<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.060> nice<00:01:15.390> dimple

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.350 

so<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.200> full<00:01:45.380> Windsor<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.950> wide<00:01:46.360> triangular

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
so the full Windsor is a wide triangular

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.660 
so the full Windsor is a wide triangular
not<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:48.020> works<00:01:48.260> best<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:48.980> a<00:01:49.010> spread<00:01:49.430> collar

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
not that works best with a spread collar

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.570 
not that works best with a spread collar
shirt<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.240> spread<00:01:50.810> collar<00:01:51.080> shirt<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:52.250> wide

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
shirt a spread collar shirt is a wide

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.420 
shirt a spread collar shirt is a wide
color<00:01:53.120> shirt<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:53.890> because<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.040> such<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> wide

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
color shirt and because it's such a wide

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.070 
color shirt and because it's such a wide
not<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.850> needs<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.180> have<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.510> extra<00:01:56.720> space

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
not it needs to have that extra space

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.610 
not it needs to have that extra space
this<00:01:57.650> also<00:01:57.920> works<00:01:58.250> best<00:01:58.610> for<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.420> man<00:01:59.720> who<00:01:59.990> has<00:02:00.229> a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
this also works best for a man who has a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.910 
this also works best for a man who has a
medium<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.370> large<00:02:01.910> build<00:02:02.240> or<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.600> wider<00:02:03.290> face<00:02:03.620> or

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
medium to large build or a wider face or

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.010 
medium to large build or a wider face or
a<00:02:03.979> wider<00:02:04.490> neck<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:05.270> doesn't<00:02:05.690> work<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:05.990> well

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
a wider neck it doesn't work so well

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.050 
a wider neck it doesn't work so well
with<00:02:06.320> somebody<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.920> has<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.490> smaller<00:02:07.790> build

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
with somebody that has a smaller build

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.999 
with somebody that has a smaller build
so<00:02:08.660> that's<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> full<00:02:09.170> Windsor<00:02:09.470> next<00:02:09.860> time

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so that's the full Windsor next time

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.170 
so that's the full Windsor next time
we're<00:02:10.160> going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.459> talking<00:02:10.640> about<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
we're going to be talking about the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.900 
we're going to be talking about the
pratt<00:02:11.390> not

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.970
