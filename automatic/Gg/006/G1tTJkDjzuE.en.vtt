it sounds perfect because sophie is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.039 
it sounds perfect because sophie is
under<00:03:38.790> three<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.510> she's<00:03:39.690> gonna<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:39.959> it

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.240 
under three so like she's gonna get it
for<00:03:40.200> free<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:42.079> she's<00:03:43.079> also<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.349> cat<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.129> I

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
for free but she's also a cat so like I

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.160 
for free but she's also a cat so like I
don't<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.549> what<00:03:45.000> their<00:03:45.120> policy<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.629> on<00:03:45.959> that

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
but cats like fish so they probably

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920 
but cats like fish so they probably
won't<00:03:50.190> let<00:03:50.430> her<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.450> may<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.750> to
