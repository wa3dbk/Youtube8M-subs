hi<00:00:00.149> YouTube<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.810> won't<00:00:01.469> show<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.650> today<00:00:02.010> my

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hi YouTube I won't show you today my

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi YouTube I won't show you today my
when<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.030> extremely<00:00:03.899> efficient<00:00:04.700> Tesla<00:00:05.700> coils

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
when you extremely efficient Tesla coils

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.370 
when you extremely efficient Tesla coils
which<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.049> did<00:00:07.259> today<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.480> I'm<00:00:09.480> using<00:00:09.719> as

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
which I did today and what I'm using as

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.730 
which I did today and what I'm using as
a<00:00:10.440> power<00:00:10.830> supply<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:12.000> small<00:00:12.740> 9-volt

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
a power supply is that small 9-volt

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.070 
a power supply is that small 9-volt
battery<00:00:14.509> my<00:00:15.740> efficient<00:00:16.740> flyback<00:00:17.190> driver<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
battery my efficient flyback driver and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.060 
battery my efficient flyback driver and
spiraled<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.400> as<00:00:20.400> usual<00:00:21.109> high<00:00:22.109> voltage<00:00:22.710> cups

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
spiraled out as usual high voltage cups

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.910 
spiraled out as usual high voltage cups
and<00:00:23.430> today<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.390> using<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:25.820> two<00:00:26.820> coils<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.920> will

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and today I'm using new two coils I will

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.669 
and today I'm using new two coils I will
connect<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> power<00:00:30.090> supply<00:00:30.410> show<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
connect the power supply show you the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
connect the power supply show you the
discharge<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.489> switch<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.360> light<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
discharge and switch the light so you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.830 
discharge and switch the light so you
can<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.340> length<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.120> sparks<00:00:36.630> because

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
can see the length of the sparks because

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.190 
can see the length of the sparks because
that's<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.640> impressive<00:00:39.020> for<00:00:40.020> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that's what pretty impressive for that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's what pretty impressive for that
small<00:00:40.649> 9-volt<00:00:41.340> battery<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.890> I'm

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
small 9-volt battery and what I'm so I'm

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
small 9-volt battery and what I'm so I'm
show<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> rifle<00:01:06.450> our<00:01:06.600> coil<00:01:07.080> which

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
show you that the rifle our coil which

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.480 
show you that the rifle our coil which
which<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> quite<00:01:08.640> interesting<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:10.369> if<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
which is quite interesting because if I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.840 
which is quite interesting because if I
shot<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> coil<00:01:12.590> I'm<00:01:13.590> getting<00:01:14.100> quite<00:01:14.520> nice

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
shot the coil I'm getting quite nice

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
shot the coil I'm getting quite nice
spark<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.810> doesn't<00:01:19.200> affect<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
spark here and it it doesn't affect the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.060 
spark here and it it doesn't affect the
output<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.549> ever<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> coil<00:01:25.070> and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
output so ever when I'm in the coil and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.850 
output so ever when I'm in the coil and
I'm<00:01:29.070> thinking<00:01:29.689> am<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.110> some<00:01:31.320> bulb<00:01:31.619> over

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'm thinking am I put some bulb over

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
I'm thinking am I put some bulb over
there<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.610> how<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.390> current<00:01:34.140> I'm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
there and see how much current I'm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.340 
there and see how much current I'm
getting<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> by<00:01:35.729> filler<00:01:36.119> coil<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.140> i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
getting on that by filler coil but i

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
getting on that by filler coil but i
will<00:01:37.710> i<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.729> later<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> well

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
will i will see that later on so well

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.420 
will i will see that later on so well
what's<00:01:40.500> what's<00:01:41.250> unusual<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:43.189> dogs<00:01:44.189> two

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
what's what's unusual about dogs two

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.760 
what's what's unusual about dogs two
coils<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:45.899> both<00:01:46.310> actually<00:01:47.750> supply

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
coils is that they both actually supply

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.340 
coils is that they both actually supply
from<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.119> fly<00:01:51.630> back<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:53.270> those

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
from from just one fly back and those

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
from from just one fly back and those
primary<00:01:55.350> windings<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.399> connected<00:01:57.090> together

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
primary windings they connected together

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.440 
primary windings they connected together
and<00:01:57.930> those<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:59.100> coils<00:01:59.700> they<00:02:00.149> haven't<00:02:00.600> got<00:02:00.869> F

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
and those two coils they haven't got F

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.260 
and those two coils they haven't got F
whatsoever<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:04.110> actually<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.520> secondary

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
whatsoever they actually the secondary

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.710 
whatsoever they actually the secondary
windings<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.649> connect<00:02:08.580> between<00:02:09.090> each<00:02:09.420> other

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
windings they connect between each other

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
windings they connect between each other
on<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> bottom<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.569> that's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
on the bottom and that's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.259 
on the bottom and that's
I<00:02:13.290> achieve<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.760> effect<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.540> that's<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
I achieve this effect and that's how I

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.920 
I achieve this effect and that's how I
achieved<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.420> output<00:02:19.189> from<00:02:20.189> from<00:02:20.610> that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
achieved this output from from that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.979 
achieved this output from from that
9-volt<00:02:21.930> battery<00:02:22.890> which<00:02:23.700> which<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.599> quite

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
9-volt battery which which is quite

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.589

impressing<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.769> me<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:27.480> would

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
impressing for me because you would

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.140 
impressing for me because you would
never<00:02:27.720> imagine<00:02:27.989> there<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.950> much<00:02:29.159> energy<00:02:29.549> in

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
never imagine there is so much energy in

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
never imagine there is so much energy in
