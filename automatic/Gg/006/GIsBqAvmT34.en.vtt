00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.880
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™m supposedly 46 today 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.970
 I show you a great fight 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.449
 Soviet rush t-62a card with us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.580
 the mines of the very beginning of the round I myself 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.519
 I want to occupy the top of the mountain 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.429
 This is basically a standard plot for 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 all of the topics on this card and in the chat I 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:37.870
 I urge everyone to say so 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.200
 tank brothers hold me in this 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.840
 why I want to do this all 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.590
 because it is strategically important on 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.129
 this map 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.129
 exactly take the top right at the beginning 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.020
 for the simple reason that thanks to this 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.480
 you can easily show half the card 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.199
 enemy territory and even if you 're lucky 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.799
 it will be possible to light the enemy arta not 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.780
 well now i'm moving one of the most 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.549
 first and I understand that the main blow 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.400
 most likely will have to me but you can not 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.780
 hesitate because if this is my allies 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.869
 they can slow down 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.630
 I notice the enemy t-62 is not 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.470
 stopping I'm starting to lead straight 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.070
 not very lucky and his shell goes to me 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.890
 guests and the damage does not pass notice I would 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.729
 chateau immediately throws him linger 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 you don't need this counter quickly 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.549
 counterattack stop and take a slide but 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.530
 that's basically all teach and we got 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.479
 Now I am in the light of day and 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 enemy art is likely here 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.490
 comes down so I snuggled up 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.740
 slides so at the very beginning not to snip off 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.550
 from what is not a card for a thousand damage 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.650
 because in the future this damage 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.200
 health rather than very very 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.880
 very useful as I have previously 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.690
 said this very important strategic 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.940
 place and all for the reason that now I 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.729
 I can highlight my opponents 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.590
 who are in this plot and 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.860
 almost with impunity if acts 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 very carefully throw and I see that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.600
 lit up the enemy art rising 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.960
 a little bit on a knoll and trying somehow 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.500
 there to aim because the hordes sticks out alone 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.410
 a gun 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.580
 it is unfortunately very, very difficult but 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.730
 I see that I am in the light 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 I decide not to risk it and give it back so that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.440
 artillery she could not me 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 reduce due to these manipulations 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:44.370
 which we occupied the crust are already visible fruit 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.700
 the numerical advantage is clearly ours and we 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.250
 continue to mow down 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.120
 our opponents photo artillery already 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.130
 they beat me from there and I'm trying here somehow 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.900
 aiming enemies 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.680
 if here we are, in principle, everything is fine then 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.230
 I see that on the right flank where usually 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 heavy tanks collide unfortunately 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.340
 everything is sad there are twenty tenths left and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 which by the way one just burst 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.580
 it means there are already 110 enemies left 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.930
 so some action is needed now 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.150
 take and go rescue their 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.190
 allies here by the way me now 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 and the Texas captures that come in handy 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.900
 kept the beginning 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 with my health fleet I undertake 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.340
 decision not to stop and immediately fly 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.310
 to counterattack 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.459
 on the move I finish the enemy heavy and I fly to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.260
 e100 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.410
 I understand that most likely now I am from 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 I want to snatch him for 900 times 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.280
 points and start quietly 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.900
 throw on 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.819
 Nld rate of fire I have enough of it 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.400
 shoot off of itself there 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.300
 recharge much longer than me and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.180
 then it goes to me on the queue exactly the same 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.540
 soviet st ecoclean t-62a 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.220
 Well, the outcome of the battle here is already in principle clear 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.620
 and all thanks to the fact that we are with tom 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.720
 started very fast and organized 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.669
 occupied 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:21.340
 good slide position and due to this we 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.760
 could enlighten most of the enemy 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.169
 technology and so the light is very good 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.330
 our fulfilled 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.740
 Allied artillery well, in principle, 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.070
 only two opponents left 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.280
 nedobitka if you can call it that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.889
 already a matter of time, of course, that 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.560
 victory is already in our pocket 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.889
 better we have nothing remarkable but 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.470
 interesting fight and interesting because he 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.540
 demonstrates well 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.639
 coordinated game of the team at the very beginning I 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.560
 asked his allies to help me 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.090
 take their slide and bringing 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.700
 thanks to coordinated action 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.370
 we could very, very quickly 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.830
 deal with the enemy on this I 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.450
