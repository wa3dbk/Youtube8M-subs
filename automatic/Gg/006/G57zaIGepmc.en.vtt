00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 or life android google is welcome to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.020
 a healthy you go to a new video and today you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm going to talk about my experience with the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.450
 pre kill twitter with plus and how to download 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:20.550
 a peephole to open a ticket 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.189
 with one plus in good video 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.250
 I started going to tell you a little of my 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 experience with him well let's say with the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.859
 tactile problems and then then some 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 small recommendations so that now 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.010
 it is a ticket and then more or less starting 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 from there you can start the process of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.760
 claim and trying to fix the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.600
 problem 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.109
 First, my experience in water has 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:56.800
 been totally good 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:59.110
 remember the 99 and this time passed up 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.269
 the eleventh simply the last month to 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.989
 my mobile phone was going great 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.619
 true that the topic was super fluid 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.360
 tactile 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.119
 then as you know we have already had 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.729
 some problems with the overuse and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.950
 but everything was solved and I was 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.270
 Come on, I was really delighted with the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 phone I have not had any problem 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.470
 never supposedly gave me the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 all cool battery 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.710
 it turns out that I had tm 12 but I was wearing 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:35.510
 analysis good because you already know that I 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:38.270
 I am the east of the channel and good when 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.820
 we do some or just to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.160
 recommend that you have some input 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.010
 because also more influenced batteries and 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.880
 things like that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.590
 in this case I make m2 of that tie list 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 and from the first day of a day to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 another day 11 to day 13 begins to notice 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.690
 tactile problems the phone does not 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.800
 it responds well but only some 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.920
 Sometimes what he did was just know 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.240
 I also started to put up with a bit and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.330
 just when you leave and do from m2ts 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.980
 official for one plus installed it but I 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.260
 still giving the same error the same 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.300
 error the same problem where today three 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.200
 days super good with the phone and of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.150
 Good at first 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 usually always tell me a phone 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.160
 the hand writing for having to look 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.810
 I notice that the phone has many feet 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.630
 It's hard for me to unlock on the screen or 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.970
 double everything that maybe later 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.970
 I want anything and the mobile 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.130
 I have to write though wmr for 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.770
 example and things like that for me has not been 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.000
 something very uncomfortable because it is a problem 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.270
 in quotes it is casual that comes and goes 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.480
 but yes, obviously as a user 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.380
 from a good phone that are 300 now 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.690
 same currently the 64 gigas are 350 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.410
 euros then I would like the utility 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.750
 in optimal conditions so nothing I 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.300
 has also opened a ticket as in 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.730
 plus I've seen that with colleagues with 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.370
 experience they have returned the phone 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.800
 a new phone has been launched and the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.890
 true that all very well how to open a 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.710
 ticket it is easy very easy 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.130
 in my case, what he did was to enter 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:36.069
 the one plus website between what enters 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.439
 with your account and store account voucher 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:44.200
 once there we have here on the left 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:47.230
 a menu that completes work with the ticket 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.299
 state which we have to click on 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.849
 ask for our email and the name I think and 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.000
 such the email 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.819
 There is a paragraph below that tells you 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.329
 how do I think it's pushing the 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.329
 call and 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:09.360
 al madrid in 36 you put it as in 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.670
 all your data and help to contact 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.400
 with you in the options, you have to 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.040
 villar 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.639
 on the phone we will put you captures 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.680
 anyway so you know that 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.910
 select problems and in the title I 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.970
 I put my touch screen 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.970
 does not bank or berlin 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.600
 while I say it come out as 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.650
 those who do not know much English 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.540
 because you put it on itself after a 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:54.020
 priori to think in English 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:56.810
 good antonio in spanish then I will 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.920
 I made a case and I did it in Spanish so 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.920
 they answered me 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:14.130
 but it is not like that 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.370
 in English but also understood my 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.070
 problem because the truth that also not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.720
 there are no unreal expressions nothing by 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.940
 so you can copy and paste in the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.460
 translator and more or less you will find out about the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.010
 idea to what came to me saying the kid 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.810
 more or less true that he did not show up 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.020
 He said he was very sorry that he was very 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:38.580
 sad to hear my experience and 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.890
 then in plus and nothing I first of all the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.690
 together a video asked me to the video that 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.700
 do it through it would not be good to 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.410
 it would not be correct what the screen 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.600
 against the mobile and nothing that what you want 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.180
 and that if not then they could do a 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.070
 tricolor script and that you select the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.770
 press to see also the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.740
 tactile behavior I did it from 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.910
 second I answered him and so he writes in 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.220
 English and then I described him again 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.350
 the problem read next to a video that 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.390
 I recorded at home I have it with the 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.950
 camera 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.690
 and nothing answered me walking outside 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.250
 given three hours the truth that they are very 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.320
 fast and well while what they tell me 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.060
 is that while they pass you let's say the 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.660
 problem to a person to a specialist 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.660
 it is a file 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.710
 and well, I guess it will be a film 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.630
 special or a special park that they have 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.510
 them that maybe in a lot of the 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.280
 cases solves the given problem given 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.800
 that maybe my thing is not so serious 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.990
 no pulse has ghost is not so 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.540
 evident the pulsation on one side and another 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.360
 of the screen is then worth the best 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.790
 out there, well, I can solve it, no, no, 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.060
 it was known why it is not checked so 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.520
 there is another video commenting 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.590
 and nothing has happened, you can follow those steps 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.410
 we will propose catches so you know 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.630
 how it's done and I hope you have a lot 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.960
 luck to all those who have 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.440
 evidence that simply not knowing is 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.440
 claim 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:32.200
 so asking or whatever it is so 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.200
 good luck 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.410
 you already know Labor share in networks 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.790
 social since the one plus has a lot 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.490
 acceptance and there are many people who 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.850
 it has and there are uninformed people who do not 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.889
 You know how do I fix it so 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.889
 thank you so much, androids
