draw which you're going to see later
helps<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> accelerate<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.299> deck<00:01:15.420> which

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
helps you accelerate to your deck which

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
helps you accelerate to your deck which
is<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.110> why<00:01:16.229> you're<00:01:16.350> only<00:01:16.439> running

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
is good that's why you're only running

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
is good that's why you're only running
to<00:01:16.799> obelisk<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> deck<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.210> run

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to obelisk because this deck will run

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.580 
to obelisk because this deck will run
through<00:01:18.630> itself<00:01:18.840> fairly<00:01:19.229> quickly

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
through itself fairly quickly

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
through itself fairly quickly
so<00:01:20.340> three<00:01:20.610> obelisk<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.090> stack<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.720> lot<00:01:21.900> so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so three obelisk would stack up a lot so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
so three obelisk would stack up a lot so
to<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.710> perfectly<00:01:23.100> fun<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.240> here's<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> other
