that's underneath it is sitting level

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.730 
that's underneath it is sitting level
and<00:01:06.450> before<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:07.540> completely<00:01:07.900> tighten<00:01:08.409> will<00:01:08.560> do

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
and before we completely tighten will do

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.870 
and before we completely tighten will do
that<00:01:08.980> want<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.700> turn<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> sink<00:01:10.180> back<00:01:10.360> over

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that want to turn the sink back over

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990 
that want to turn the sink back over
okay<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:15.040> just<00:01:15.190> basically<00:01:15.400> going<00:01:15.880> to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
okay we're just basically going to

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.110 
okay we're just basically going to
reverse<00:01:16.270> procedure<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.930> what<00:01:20.080> we<00:01:20.230> did<00:01:20.410> before

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
reverse procedure or what we did before

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.610 
reverse procedure or what we did before
so<00:01:22.120> first<00:01:22.330> thing<00:01:22.480> I<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:22.960> put<00:01:23.260> this<00:01:23.410> on

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
so first thing I do is just put this on

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.050 
so first thing I do is just put this on
there<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.100> kind<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.370> get<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:24.700> out<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
there just to kind of get it out of the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.470 
there just to kind of get it out of the
way<00:01:26.160> and<00:01:27.160> then<00:01:27.370> we<00:01:27.490> come<00:01:27.670> back<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.800> get<00:01:30.480> our

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
way and then we come back and we get our

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.190 
way and then we come back and we get our
pieces<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:35.850> remember<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.000> goes<00:01:37.300> down<00:01:37.600> like

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
pieces here remember that goes down like

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.490 
pieces here remember that goes down like
that<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.120> then<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.330> barrel<00:01:40.600> goes<00:01:40.930> over<00:01:41.320> there

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
that and then the barrel goes over there

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.970 
that and then the barrel goes over there
every<00:01:41.650> extension<00:01:42.220> barrel<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.470> then<00:01:44.860> all

every extension barrel and then all

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.230 
every extension barrel and then all
we're<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.250> do<00:01:45.400> right<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:45.730> is<00:01:45.760> finger

then hand tightening only for right now
remember<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.890> tightens<00:02:21.610> only<00:02:23.070> if<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.220> gotta

see<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.810> things<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.380> going<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.560> be<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
see that things are going to be in the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.750 
see that things are going to be in the
right<00:02:27.070> place<00:02:28.470> now<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.800> these<00:02:30.070> spring<00:02:30.400> clips

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
right place now on these spring clips

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.200 
right place now on these spring clips
what<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.600> like<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.110> do<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:35.490> when<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.520> put<00:02:36.820> them<00:02:37.060> on

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
what I like to do is when I put them on

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.280 
what I like to do is when I put them on
I<00:02:37.270> put<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:38.020> end<00:02:38.230> behind<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:39.630> one<00:02:40.630> end<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.110> this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
I put one end behind in one end on this

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
I put one end behind in one end on this
side<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:43.420> happens<00:02:44.640> when<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.880> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
side because what happens when you do it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.240 
side because what happens when you do it
this<00:02:46.060> way<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.850> doesn't<00:02:52.240> fall<00:02:52.480> off<00:02:53.250> okay

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
this way the it doesn't fall off okay

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.820 
this way the it doesn't fall off okay
because<00:02:54.900> you've<00:02:55.900> got<00:02:56.050> tension<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.650> either

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
because you've got tension on either

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.949 
because you've got tension on either
side<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.700> lever<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.450> even<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:58.840> you're

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
side of this lever so even if you're

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.540 
side of this lever so even if you're
moving<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> up<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.650> down<00:02:59.770> it's<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> move

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
moving it up and down it's going to move

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.620 
moving it up and down it's going to move
okay<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.280> rotated<00:03:07.060> slightly<00:03:07.300> so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
okay so this just rotated slightly so

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.500 
okay so this just rotated slightly so
we've<00:03:07.750> gotten<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.140> straight<00:03:08.500> away<00:03:08.530> again

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
we've gotten that straight away again

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650 
we've gotten that straight away again
and<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.780> will<00:03:10.900> turn<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.350> over<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.450> we'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
and that will turn this over and we'll

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.390 
and that will turn this over and we'll

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
we even have to convince just a little

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.520 
we even have to convince just a little
bit

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
bit

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.990

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
these things that this matter of inches

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:58.000 
these things that this matter of inches
sometimes<00:05:46.040> from<00:05:47.040> this<00:05:47.190> side<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:50.700> heresy

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.840 

there<00:05:59.010> we<00:05:59.160> go<00:05:59.340> now<00:05:59.760> we<00:05:59.820> go<00:06:00.120> okay<00:06:01.310> go<00:06:02.310> ahead<00:06:02.430> back

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
ice talking about the calcium that

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.140 
ice talking about the calcium that
builds<00:06:16.110> up<00:06:16.230> if<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:17.100> look<00:06:17.280> at<00:06:17.400> this<00:06:17.550> area<00:06:17.910> tur

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
builds up if you look at this area tur

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.120 
builds up if you look at this area tur
look<00:06:18.480> at<00:06:18.600> all<00:06:18.720> this<00:06:18.870> green<00:06:19.230> dunk<00:06:19.590> on<00:06:19.830> there

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850
