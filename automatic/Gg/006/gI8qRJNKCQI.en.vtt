that we want to talk about is actually a

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.780 
that we want to talk about is actually a
drill<00:00:58.150> that<00:00:58.420> works<00:00:59.140> on<00:00:59.350> getting<00:00:59.589> more<00:01:00.159> of<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
drill that works on getting more of the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.899 
drill that works on getting more of the
hip<00:01:01.119> into<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.049> throw<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.040> also<00:01:03.309> has<00:01:03.729> to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
hip into the throw and it also has to

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.990 
hip into the throw and it also has to
deal<00:01:04.119> with<00:01:04.710> working<00:01:05.710> properly<00:01:06.010> from<00:01:06.850> the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
deal with working properly from the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.660 
deal with working properly from the
ground<00:01:07.360> up<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:07.810> moving<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.560> feet<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
ground up so moving the feet then the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.630 
ground up so moving the feet then the
knees<00:01:10.000> then<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.930> hip<00:01:11.140> see<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.280> issues

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
knees then the hip see one of the issues

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.910 
knees then the hip see one of the issues
that<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:12.880> find<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.570> lot<00:01:13.720> with<00:01:13.960> our<00:01:14.080> throwers<00:01:14.619> is

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
that I find a lot with our throwers is

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.760 
that I find a lot with our throwers is
that<00:01:15.189> when<00:01:15.939> they<00:01:16.119> finally<00:01:16.810> get<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.289> implement

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
that when they finally get the implement

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.830 
that when they finally get the implement
in<00:01:17.920> their<00:01:18.130> hand<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.700> there's<00:01:19.329> weight<00:01:19.630> in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
in their hand and there's weight in

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.090 
in their hand and there's weight in
their<00:01:20.020> hand<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:20.469> they're<00:01:20.649> getting<00:01:20.770> ready<00:01:20.979> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
their hand and they're getting ready to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.789 
their hand and they're getting ready to
throw<00:01:21.570> sometimes<00:01:22.570> things<00:01:22.929> just<00:01:23.079> kind<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:23.530> fall

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
throw sometimes things just kind of fall

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.919 
throw sometimes things just kind of fall
apart<00:01:23.829> what<00:01:24.429> I<00:01:24.460> mean<00:01:24.670> by<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.240> they<00:01:25.719> might

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
apart what I mean by that is they might

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.779 
apart what I mean by that is they might
be<00:01:26.049> in<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.229> circle<00:01:26.710> or<00:01:27.009> outside<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
be in the circle or outside of the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.429 
be in the circle or outside of the
circle<00:01:28.030> with<00:01:28.359> nothing<00:01:28.689> in<00:01:28.810> their<00:01:28.960> hand<00:01:29.200> and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
circle with nothing in their hand and

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.840 
circle with nothing in their hand and
then<00:01:29.890> moving<00:01:30.219> perfectly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
then moving perfectly

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.539 
then moving perfectly
feet<00:01:31.149> are<00:01:31.359> moving<00:01:31.479> first<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:33.280> meat

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
feet are moving first then the meat

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.359 
feet are moving first then the meat
extends<00:01:34.210> then<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.749> hip<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.770> they<00:01:36.039> push

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
extends then the hip and then they push

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.429 
extends then the hip and then they push
once<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.240> put<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.450> shot<00:01:37.869> in<00:01:38.079> their<00:01:38.229> hand

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
once you put that shot in their hand

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.870 
once you put that shot in their hand
once<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:38.740> put<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:38.950> discus<00:01:39.399> in<00:01:39.549> their<00:01:39.670> hand

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
once you put that discus in their hand

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.010 
once you put that discus in their hand
it<00:01:40.060> falls<00:01:40.509> apart

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
it falls apart

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.749 
it falls apart
and<00:01:41.170> they<00:01:41.229> just<00:01:41.439> think<00:01:41.619> I<00:01:41.890> gotta<00:01:42.249> crank<00:01:42.549> this

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
and they just think I gotta crank this

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.340 
and they just think I gotta crank this
thing<00:01:42.819> I<00:01:43.179> didn't<00:01:43.390> throw<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.810> thing<00:01:43.990> as<00:01:44.140> far

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
thing I didn't throw this thing as far

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.309 
thing I didn't throw this thing as far
as<00:01:44.469> possible<00:01:44.679> so<00:01:45.189> what<00:01:45.999> I<00:01:46.030> do<00:01:46.149> is<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.719> backed

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
as possible so what I do is I backed

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.349 
as possible so what I do is I backed
them<00:01:47.530> off<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.950> break<00:01:48.369> them<00:01:48.609> down<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.819> little<00:01:49.119> bit

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
them off I break them down a little bit

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.599 
them off I break them down a little bit
and<00:01:49.600> what<00:01:50.350> I'll<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.770> take<00:01:51.009> something<00:01:51.310> like

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
and what I'll do is take something like

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.580

probably done it by now a hundred
different<00:03:30.489> times<00:03:30.850> then<00:03:31.569> we<00:03:31.780> start<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.170> speed

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
different times then we start to speed

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.949 
different times then we start to speed
it<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.950> actually<00:03:33.099> try<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.609> make<00:03:34.239> that

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
it up and actually try to make that

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.490 
it up and actually try to make that
3-step<00:03:35.739> all<00:03:36.190> one<00:03:36.970> fluid<00:03:37.480> motion<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.410> would

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
3-step all one fluid motion so it would

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.890 
3-step all one fluid motion so it would
look<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.709> this<00:03:39.069> instead<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:40.090> feet<00:03:40.420> medium

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
look like this instead of feet medium

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.199 
look like this instead of feet medium
