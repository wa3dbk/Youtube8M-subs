00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 Tell me, how are you? We're here. 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.910
 lg digital experience 2014 giving a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.160
 Looked at li made more than 72 is a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 improved version of the first ipad that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.869
 Do not know that in Brazil last year. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.340
 and that my side was the rafael lg 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.609
 who will talk meanwhile the product 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.609
 for us 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.769
 there has been an improvement both by testing is a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 old know the ultralight was also jesus 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 that product was 1050 grams and now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.579
 this time with a big question of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 processing has also changed a great deal 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.489
 The focus of the map queues was based on the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.390
 architecture of the parent processor of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 third generation now cleans the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 intel processor package was 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 is based on the fourth 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.379
 generation of the family coast was much more 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 fast that double talk is a matter that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.260
 connections 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 we continue with the name but now 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 we had designed with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.220
 106 or sp 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 here on the outside in 2006 the ccb dean 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 from st 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.909
 another novelty that is very cool 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.979
 the leader would come back to against 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.280
 people he that not much else 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 Can you change the image to receive the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 passing the Julius is and a victory against the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 fish in the final 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 one of the main points of the first 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.299
 ipad was an internal storage with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.119
 some people there is a bit of noise 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.520
 lg also tinkering with sharing is not 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 Good, you always do a ssd spin . 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.990
 even because if I put more there would be 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.700
 much in the final price 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.619
 we can say that we have a huge 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.380
 search for security 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.270
 was an external HD to make the market 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 stay here for a photo where we can 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.610
 do what the computer is some reason 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 to go out but also has the part 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.060
 practice 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.429
 Speaking of price offered in Brazil 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.709
 did not leave I still can not set 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:12.000
 because here we only work with 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.069
 decorum specifications is different 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 from unrelated products and we will 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.799
 living with them already have a forecast of 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.170
 price probably for more for May 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.549
 even ef he will stay and it will come 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.109
 cheaper than your 1st 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.470
 Now everything is cheaper than 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.470
 first
