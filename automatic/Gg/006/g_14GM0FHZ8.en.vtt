00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that he just those two days will be a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750 
that he just those two days will be a
success<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.800> good<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.160> went<00:00:29.609> into

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
success it was really good we went into

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.020 
success it was really good we went into
two<00:00:30.000> groups<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.199> six<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.769> six<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> Lars

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
two groups you know six and six and Lars

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840 
two groups you know six and six and Lars
Totenberg<00:00:33.620> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.860> found<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.190> 10k<00:00:35.460> loop

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
Totenberg kind of he found this 10k loop

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
Totenberg kind of he found this 10k loop
where<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.260> part<00:00:37.469> flat

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
where we are doing your first part flat

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.889 
where we are doing your first part flat
so<00:00:38.340> kind<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.579> echelon<00:00:38.940> even<00:00:39.270> climbing<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so kind of echelon even climbing and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.650 
so kind of echelon even climbing and
then<00:00:39.989> descending<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.010> mean<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> kind

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
then descending so I mean it's the kind

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.910 
then descending so I mean it's the kind
of<00:00:42.690> thing<00:00:42.840> where<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
of thing where you can have really

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
of thing where you can have really
strong<00:00:44.129> riders<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.700> doesn't<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.840> makes

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
strong riders but doesn't it only makes

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
strong riders but doesn't it only makes
a<00:00:46.140> difference<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:47.010> kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
a difference if we all are kind of in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
a difference if we all are kind of in
sync<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.000> nice<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.750> me<00:00:48.870> being<00:00:49.110> newer

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sync so it's nice to for me being newer

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.950 
sync so it's nice to for me being newer
to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> sport<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.579> nice<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
to the sport it's really nice to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.330 
to the sport it's really nice to
practice<00:00:51.960> before<00:00:52.110> I've<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.559> done<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
practice before I've just done it in the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
practice before I've just done it in the
in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> races<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.930> high

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
in the races where it's kind of high

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
in the races where it's kind of high
pressure<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.129> nice<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
pressure so it's nice to do it in this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
pressure so it's nice to do it in this
setting<00:00:57.360> most<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.469> riders<00:00:58.710> were<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
setting most of the riders were here and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
setting most of the riders were here and
it's<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.399> often<00:00:59.579> during<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> season<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's not often during the season that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's not often during the season that
riders<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.359> be<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.629> place<00:01:03.690> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
riders get to be in the same place you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
riders get to be in the same place you
know<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.260> racing<00:01:04.710> schedule<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.280> does<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
know with racing schedule so does this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450 
know with racing schedule so does this
kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> drill<00:01:06.840> happen<00:01:07.170> often<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
kind of drill happen often and will it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
kind of drill happen often and will it
happen<00:01:08.640> often<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> months<00:01:09.630> ahead<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
happen often in the months ahead or is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
happen often in the months ahead or is
it<00:01:10.170> quite<00:01:10.290> rare<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> chance

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it quite rare that they get the chance

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
it quite rare that they get the chance
to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.880> did<00:01:11.939> today<00:01:12.439> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> very

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to do what they did today this is very

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.070 
to do what they did today this is very
rare<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.700> opportunity

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
rare that we have that opportunity

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.969 
rare that we have that opportunity
having<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> girls<00:01:16.729> here<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.830> Europe<00:01:19.830> it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
having all the girls here in Europe it's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
having all the girls here in Europe it's
a<00:01:20.509> at<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.070> riders

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a at one time because we have riders

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
a at one time because we have riders
from<00:01:24.619> North<00:01:25.619> America<00:01:26.220> Australia<00:01:26.430> Europe<00:01:27.180> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
week we heading to China so that to be

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.200 
week we heading to China so that to be
that<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:36.030> quite<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> quite<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> good<00:01:37.560> moment<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that was quite a quite a good moment to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.649 
that was quite a quite a good moment to
first<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:40.970> evaluate<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> season<00:01:42.509> how<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
first of all evaluate the season how it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.280 
first of all evaluate the season how it
has<00:01:42.810> been<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> far<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.360> evaluate<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.600> where

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
has been so far to evaluate very where

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.609 
has been so far to evaluate very where
we<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.590> improve<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.270> what<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.899> which

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
we can improve and what which was which
