00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.450
 the piaggio group stopped over in paris 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.939
 to present his new mp3 hybrid 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.769
 300 lt aesthetically this mp3 is 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.179
 similar to the 125 version presented the year 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.990
 latest 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.759
 technically the machine evolved into 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.230
 proposing a wider front train and 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.520
 a single cylinder of two hundred and sixty 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.560
 eighteen cubic centimeters always 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.390
 assisted by an electric motor of 2.6 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.980
 kilowatts the battery located under the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.810
 saddle recharges via a simple plug 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 current carrying capacity 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 therefore reduces to the only chest in the back 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.699
 the dashboard indicates the level of 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.140
 vehicle load that can be used 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.150
 in three different ways 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.470
 a hybrid power mode or both engines 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 work together to give 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.710
 accelerations close to a 400 and a mode 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.320
 hybrid charge that recharges 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.430
 the batteries while rolling 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.900
 finally the all-electric mode offers a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.000
 20 km autonomy for a speed 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.280
 maximum of 30 km / h in silence 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.660
 total operating an alarm 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 specific is proposed for 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.159
 prevent pedestrians your arrival 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.659
 another advantage of this technology the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.820
 mp3 has a reverse that 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.050
 is very practical in town for the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.210
 rest we find the same solutions 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.589
 used on the range ltÃ©e namely a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.269
 centralized brake pedal at the foot 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.589
 right a parking brake and the famous 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.420
 system makes the man that allows to do 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.860
 do not put your feet on the ground when you stop 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 first impressions are either it's 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 positive 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.039
 overall we have a vehicle that is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.899
 much more convincing than the 125th 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.939
 we had tried last year which 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.740
 appeared more like a test product 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.520
 there was a more successful product because 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.409
 we have a better balance 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 simply with the heat engine that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.100
 works in three cubic centimeters 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 with more couples than the 125 and so 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.920
 is more pleasant 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 as soon as one takes a bit and it always 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.280
 big advantage of propulsion 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.319
 especially in the areas 30 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.659
 operating silence sweetness 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.149
 at startup and then of course walking 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.340
 back is a little plus the strong point 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.229
 of stone plays it's the effort that the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 mark made on the introductory price of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.340
 this model who made an alternative 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.700
 credible and interesting to the models 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.549
 thermal 400 lt or even 300 lt 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 actually the arrival of 300 of 303 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.399
 Hybrid wheels is a real plus 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.080
 compared to the 125 the 125 was fishing by 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.759
 a parent an extra weight of 30 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.149
 kg generated by the presence of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.879
 battery 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.920
 So we're really happy to see 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.739
 happen this version 300 lt so 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.890
 accessible with a simple license the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.080
 electric fashion actually in my opinion 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.269
 is reserved for almost 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 pedestrians are good here we are 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.319
 limited to 30 km hour the capabilities 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.060
 acceleration remains relatively limited 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.469
 marketing director piaggio in France 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.909
 jean philippe dauviau returns to the 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.249
 positioning of this vehicle in the 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.469
 range mp3 then the 125 cubic centimeter 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.260
 was an image product intended for a 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.989
 exclusively urban use how is going 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.469
 position the 300 the mp3 300 hybrid 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.180
 will position itself between the mp3 300 which 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.069
 already exists in normal heat engine 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 and the mp3 400 ie it's a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.700
 vehicle that will bring through his 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.349
 thermal engine a little bit more 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.669
 power since we add the power 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.019
 from the electric motor to the power of 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.700
 thermal engine so it's already three 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.150
 cubic centimeters and it's a vehicle 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.280
 which at the price level will position itself 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.139
 a little bit above the 400 mp3 let's say 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.939
 that version 300 and flange has more than 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.370
 potential that version 125 since 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.719
 this is a lt 300 cm cube version it can 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.409
 to be driven with the car license 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.400
 so he actually has a field of 2.2 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.109
 growth and development 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.980
 much more much more important 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.540
 since we can take the fast lanes 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.030
 where 125 was a little 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.189
 limited then it has content 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.349
 strong technology that can allow 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.290
 some people to pass the course 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.900
 I would say to put investment 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.220
 additional on the mp3 300 hybrids 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.689
 because they are people who 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.069
 also invest in the respect of 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.259
 the environment and in vehicles 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.650
 which are both cleaner and more 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.650
 citizen
