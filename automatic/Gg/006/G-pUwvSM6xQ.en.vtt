motions getting to the WAC tournament
did<00:00:18.600> feel<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:20.270> live<00:00:21.270> big<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
did feel that way to you live big in the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.290 
did feel that way to you live big in the
year<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.260> thought<00:00:22.730> we<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
year we thought we want to get that a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.339 
year we thought we want to get that a
large<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.320> season<00:00:25.769> went<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:27.170> it<00:00:28.170> just

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
large bit the season went on it just

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
large bit the season went on it just
turned<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.550> way<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.240> could<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
turned out that the way we could get the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
turned out that the way we could get the
turn<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> whack<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.040> guess<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.059> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
turn it was to whack so I guess this is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.530 
turn it was to whack so I guess this is
kind<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> big<00:00:33.989> folks<00:00:34.260> later<00:00:35.270> do<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> feel
