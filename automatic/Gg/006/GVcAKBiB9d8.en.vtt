00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.730
 with the merchant mix before i go my red 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 gold filled body making fun and them 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.349
 fill with ice 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.939
 you need the merchant mix for that 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:22.060
 enters bread flower garden water buttery 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.700
 tomato puree and white wine 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.810
 I'm going to make it in the food processor 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:34.090
 you can of course also use a hand mixer 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:43.769
 never use hooks with moisture 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.769
 past and 250 milliliters of water 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 thickest to season 2 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.390
 if one has gotten a bit stuck 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.300
 for the time when you can quite 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.670
 easily from the stalks by scoot 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.420
 theo the farmer airy 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 to move you will never get bored 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.950
 stalks and summer we are not going for nothing 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.470
 this one is well kneaded now, but be it tim 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 and the right and rise in room 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.240
 temperature to show you the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.280
 bulbs to fill we are west meat 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.540
 therefore I will divide it into thirds 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.950
 rolls and nicely convex 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.570
 naturally neatly want a piece out 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.970
 each other on a baking sheet because they have to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.880
 just to travel and love us 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.229
 come together 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 who wants to do it because they will him soon 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.100
 bachelor house 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 brush them with a little water 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.950
 especially flour okay 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 because there is always a clean towel or 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.070
 an hour later the counter naturally took 60 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.250
 minutes 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.959
 well 20 minutes are the merciful leave 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.269
 roll like it happens to a whole 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.340
 Cool a little bit before you put it on 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.220
 you can easily cut and so you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.599
 not your climb burnt like well with one 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.239
 blade 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:28.100
 the inside loose along the edges and the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.630
 inside pole already very easy 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.830
 out with a spoon 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.840
 so of course not so that we the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.310
 inside we go fine for you 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.860
 to make good of us 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.849
 dicing oil find about about 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.130
 these will go back one day 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.910
 about ten minutes back so 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.590
 inside 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:54.530
 getting crunchy in search so that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:56.510
 can not get through all runs off the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.720
 pot giving his house back in over ten 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.590
 minutes approximately down after 10 minutes 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.709
 the ball out over is the red more handsome than 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 you can put it on a plate 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.190
 I will give all the pavement in love 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 then let that never make you sick 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.810
 just have to be able to pour like this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.660
 the hood hope 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.019
 in this case it's a good chance 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.170
 it was more than decoration for farmers 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.640
