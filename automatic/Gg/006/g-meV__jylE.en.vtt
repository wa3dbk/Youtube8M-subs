does have the recessed trackball which
is<00:03:35.650> very<00:03:35.860> interesting<00:03:36.180> let's<00:03:37.180> go<00:03:37.269> ahead<00:03:37.330> and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
is very interesting let's go ahead and

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.720 
is very interesting let's go ahead and
boot<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.900> sucker<00:03:38.200> up<00:03:38.440> for<00:03:38.739> up<00:03:39.280> for<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.580> first

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
boot this sucker up for up for the first

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.550 
boot this sucker up for up for the first
time<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.150> let's<00:03:40.330> see<00:03:40.840> if<00:03:40.959> it's<00:03:41.080> got<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.230> chart

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
time and let's see if it's got a chart

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.729 
time and let's see if it's got a chart
and<00:03:41.799> see<00:03:41.950> how<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.160> looks<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.530> hold<00:03:44.680> down

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
and see how it looks so if you hold down

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.039 
and see how it looks so if you hold down
the<00:03:44.830> power<00:03:44.950> button<00:03:45.220> right<00:03:45.549> there<00:03:46.049> it's

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
the power button right there it's

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.449 
the power button right there it's
actually<00:03:47.290> unstable<00:03:47.830> so<00:03:48.010> when<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.220> have<00:03:48.340> it

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
actually unstable so when you have it

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.180 
actually unstable so when you have it
open<00:03:48.549> up<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:48.940> not<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:50.650> solid<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.040> kind<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
open up it's not not solid it kind of

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
rocks around a little bit the setup

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.250 
rocks around a little bit the setup
