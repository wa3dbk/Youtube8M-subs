00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.530
 hello roommates today I bring you 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.450
 a tutorial dedicated to changing the engine 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.940
 of closing the fuel cap of 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.790
 our team one the piece in me cost in 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.920
 volkswagen spare parts about 28 euros the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.410
 estimated time to do it with this 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.779
 tutorial should not be more than 30 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.180
 minutes since it's quite simple and not 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.730
 has more complication how can you 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.009
 observe when closing the car the cover 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 fuel remains open models 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.180
 Older people used to give problems for 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 that has been improving the piece 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.950
 this is the box where the piece comes from and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.140
 when we take it out we can observe the number of 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.300
 reference of the same say you have 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.220
 varied from d to f with what 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 which should be noted an improvement of the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 same now and as said the jack 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.090
 ripper let's go in parts first 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.370
 remove the lid on the right side of the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.500
 trunk and so we can access the hole 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 where the connection socket is located 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.150
 of the closing motor as I put you in the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.160
 image that is the plastic lid that 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.010
 you have to remove pulling towards us 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.990
 it comes out very easily you also have to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.479
 remove the connector that is marked in 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.850
 the next image if you observe already 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.800
 removed the plastic lid here you have 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.130
 the connector comes out pressing in the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.350
 side as seen in the picture 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.719
 with the fuel cap open 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.000
 unscrew the screw torques of 10 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.920
 we took out the gas cap and how 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.079
 observe in the image we grab the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.630
 softest part of rubber and we throw towards 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.909
 outside we are taking out carefully all the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.159
 stile of the lid and before removing it 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.409
 completely unplug the small 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.420
 hose socket used to evacuate 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.000
 the fuel that can fall inside 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.159
 When Refueling already have everything outside it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.289
 we clean a little since it will be quite 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.780
 dirty and we put it in a place that does not 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.630
 fall in this image you have the view 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.490
 of the hose that will stay there good 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.039
 here you have the cause that is not 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.959
 close the fuel cap there's only 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.450
 to take it out of its place to the right 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.819
 and looking in more detail you see the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 Finished reference number in d now 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.410
 touch remove the plastic protector 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.420
 pulling us out so push towards 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.030
 inside putting all the plastic and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 then take it out of the side it goes all to the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.560
 once since it is a unique piece and here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.450
 you have already assembled the new one from 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.140
 here you have to do everything again but 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.140
 the other way round 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.959
 finally we verify that closing the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.270
 car will close the fuel cap 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.160
 if you have low you can delete the error 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.680
 that gave intermittent failure in the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.959
 closing engine this is all foreros 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.730
 I hope you liked my tutorial 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.730
 see you greetings
