00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.990
 boss 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.320
 what's up the poles today we get 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.119
 found for commented gameplay on 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.800
 call of duty black ops own and the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.160
 technical of the year techniques of the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.230
 moment 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 put yourself in a corner on call of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 Duty well like that huh with you and the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.780
 double old and or amazing good brief on 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.940
 we do not care we did it 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.260
 serious here we will try to stop 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.879
 this side gameplay that I coached f 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.540
 you will have understood it stay blackops a 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.590
 ol 96 in gold and then ben we will make a 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.120
 little gameplay I think it's when 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.379
 even quite acceptable so that's why 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.700
 that I propose and my biggest challenge 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.290
 it is to pass on its chains like the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.780
 ter so that's the case a big thank you 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.800
 he also not my gameplay 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.270
 look in the description go see 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.500
 red sky the publisher his dog frankly 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.640
 it's worth it it was super league 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.920
 king will start sending again a long time 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 that's how it's said and today 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.820
 we will talk about the exams so for me 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.020
 exams it's something pretty 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.580
 important since I can not 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.229
 most miss them I'm still pretty 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.649
 old so suddenly that's it 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.200
 I succeed 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.300
 absolutely and then I have some small 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.820
 techniques actually a year mainly 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.289
 one in fact it's I close my eyes and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.910
 before an oral or a writing I think about 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.470
 holiday and this thing is it 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.450
 does not work in fact it's 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.830
 a big crappy technique and to 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.729
 every time i get myself gay being 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.810
 given that when I'm an oral I do 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.520
 and that when I'm in writing I'm getting 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.660
 shit hospital actually I would have 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.470
 maybe had to study a little bit more 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.929
 all I'm really going to do to me 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.340
 to fuck and so I ask you to 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.920
 guys is what you have a 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 technical because it does not go there 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.610
 it's impossible monsters monsters if they 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.590
 increase considerably 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.569
 georges goes from 0 to 100 in beats 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.770
 of the heart it is abused hungry zero either 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.869
 possible but hey you understand me 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.599
 it's a little joke like that 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.619
 little duke and then on the other hand 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.399
 I noticed something this year 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.229
 goes pretty well 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.090
 but euros since I'm everything 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.610
 time e and yet we say ibra 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 rouaix very good very good storm very very 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.369
 good subject is very well developed and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 in the end I always make 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.910
 80 stands yet so this year it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.470
 go but usually it was not going 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090
 too many previous years fucking osteo 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.450
 it's crap can improve can 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.190
 do better 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 so that's short if you have a 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 technique said there me so I also 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.780
 a little thing that happens to me but that I 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 I'm sure and sure it happens to you too 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 guys before a review period and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.810
 well youtube and facebook become 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.940
 favorite places par excellence 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.100
 I actually really love it happened 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.540
 a lot of time and I actually go 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.790
 so much time that in the end I do not 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.610
 thought 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.750
 she studied and I stress even more 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 for my exams since I did not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.909
 not studied 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.439
 that's what happened to my 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.170
 English exam then I was 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.670
 quietly sitting on a tare apple 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.049
 and then I ask myself the question is this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.700
 that I will pass this exam 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.470
 since I did not study then 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.879
 there guys I did a project trick 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.170
 managed like a pig I got I 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.299
 do to my friend, go ahead and tell me 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.340
 leaf the guy was billing the blow I 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.439
 told him it'll be okay I'm worried 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.139
 successful and I took his sheet I have everything 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.849
 copy from a to z and juice 59% 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.680
 okay it's not very glorious 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.120
 but at least I passed my exam and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.040
 Here bah it ended like this at 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.049
 least that's for sure that I managed to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.069
 the respect here and then I already have like a 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.139
 counter I am super happy but 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.090
 here and at the passage of blockages 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.470
 dogs and then rightly so what I 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.060
 ask yourself as a question is what 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.530
 you have a lot of time on 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.090
 facebook or youtube because me 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.090
 usually I stay like a 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.680
 half an hour or 40 minutes on youtube and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.459
 Facebook 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.439
 while his exams I can stay 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.840
 so like I said a full day 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.669
 and it has already leaked me several years 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.139
 you guys say it's approve these 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.669
 test again that's for sure and 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.400
 certain 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.599
 and then here and so suddenly 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.099
 example play all the conversations 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.940
 I had before guys with whom 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.680
 I had spoken since 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.239
 finally that I had been able to talk more about 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.430
 example a year and I start then talked 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.169
 and I redo oh yes but in fact how 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.310
 are you gonna what islams will it go and 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.419
 and then I can spend hours talking 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.579
 like that to a lot of people who I could 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.040
 talk and then he stays stuck youtube 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.209
 the same thing for example on on my 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.579
 youtube account and I see that since 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.909
 I have a new video in the big way 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.069
 up 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.840
 here and I'm still having 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.159
 interesting there is something to see there there 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.389
 there is something nice about call of 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.799
 I had not seen that yet 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.729
 interesting and then I can stay by 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.870
 example of hours kept full of 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.760
 different videos while usually 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.959
 after half an hour I get drunk and there 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.129
 I'm stuck in fact I say to myself but 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.540
 damn shit it's still 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.680
 interesting and I'm doing so much 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.750
 fixette on it posed full of 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.190
 questions that in the end makes me when 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.590
 even always always have 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.539
 and then here you go if you too 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.919
 stayed stuck on this problem actually who 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.310
 facebook or youtube say it in the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.560
 comments 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.090
 and this guy will determine me poutou lease I 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.659
