goes<00:03:43.600> true<00:03:44.290> for<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.950> speakers<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> have

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
goes true for the speakers so I have

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.410 
goes true for the speakers so I have
three<00:03:46.570> different<00:03:46.840> sets<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.380> Styria<00:03:47.680> speakers

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.360

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
but let's say for some reason I wanted

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.460 
but let's say for some reason I wanted
to<00:03:55.010> have<00:03:55.190> all<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.760> speakers<00:03:56.150> on

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.430 
speakers together but you know that's
not<00:04:08.300> super<00:04:08.780> useful

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
not super useful

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.950 
not super useful
what<00:04:09.890> if<00:04:10.070> let's<00:04:10.700> say<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.910> have<00:04:11.210> a<00:04:11.240> sub<00:04:11.600> one<00:04:11.750> on

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.450 

where<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.090> level<00:04:42.420> is<00:04:42.690> can<00:04:42.990> be<00:04:43.110> added<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.010> or

where this level is can be added to a or
b

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.340 

you<00:04:47.180> also<00:04:47.330> have<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> couple<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.960> other<00:04:48.110> really

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
you also have a couple of other really

00:04:48.350 --> 00:05:00.050 
you also have a couple of other really
cool<00:04:48.470> features<00:04:48.680> like

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.189 

you<00:05:00.300> can<00:05:00.480> also<00:05:00.630> dim<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.200> speakers

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.050 

so<00:05:05.499> that's<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> monitor<00:05:06.069> station<00:05:06.249> version<00:05:06.849> to

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
so that's the monitor station version to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.149 
so that's the monitor station version to
this<00:05:07.659> part<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.169> the<00:05:08.379> price<00:05:08.560> didn't<00:05:08.949> change

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
this part is the price didn't change

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:15.690 
this part is the price didn't change
it's<00:05:09.370> $2.99<00:05:10.030> just<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:10.629> old<00:05:10.780> one
