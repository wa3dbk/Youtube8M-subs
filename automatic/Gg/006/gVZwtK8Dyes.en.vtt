well where there is you know like within

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 
well where there is you know like within
the<00:00:12.000> maps<00:00:12.210> there's<00:00:12.599> kind<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.929> multiple<00:00:13.349> layers

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the maps there's kind of multiple layers

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.049 
the maps there's kind of multiple layers
there's<00:00:13.799> places<00:00:13.980> where<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.730> Titans

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
there's places where the the Titans

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.220 
there's places where the the Titans
can't<00:00:15.269> go<00:00:15.420> there's<00:00:15.630> places<00:00:15.839> where<00:00:16.080> only

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
can't go there's places where only

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
can't go there's places where only
pilots<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.279> there's<00:00:17.460> places

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
pilots can get to and there's places

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
pilots can get to and there's places
where<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> open<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.439> pilot

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
where you know out in the open a pilot

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
where you know out in the open a pilot
is<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> scream<00:00:21.539> disadvantage

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is going to be at a scream disadvantage

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.810 
is going to be at a scream disadvantage
where<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> opposite<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> true<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.490> other

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
where the opposite is true in other

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
where the opposite is true in other
areas<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> map<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.140> duality<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
areas of the map so it's this duality of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.670 
areas of the map so it's this duality of
gameplay<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.140> gold<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
gameplay and it's not a the gold is to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
gameplay and it's not a the gold is to
get<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> Titan<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:29.910> you're<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.240> powerful

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
get a Titan and now you're all powerful

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
get a Titan and now you're all powerful
it<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.669> balancing<00:00:32.669> act<00:00:32.850> throughout

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it really is a balancing act throughout

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
it really is a balancing act throughout
the<00:00:33.329> entire<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> weaponry<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
disembark from it it becomes an AI so it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
disembark from it it becomes an AI so it
will<00:01:16.439> follow<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.640> set<00:01:17.820> it

to garden area you know simple commands

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.380 
to garden area you know simple commands
this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.460> point<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.270> don't

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this is not you know point and we don't

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
this is not you know point and we don't
want<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> complicated<00:01:22.409> command<00:01:22.619> system<00:01:22.920> we

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
want a complicated command system we

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.789 
want a complicated command system we
want<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.430> very<00:01:23.610> easy<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> user<00:01:25.170> but

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
want it to be very easy on the user but

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
want it to be very easy on the user but
you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.850> run<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.900> Titan<00:01:28.140> on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you can run around have your Titan on

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
you can run around have your Titan on
follow<00:01:28.439> mode<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:28.950> guard<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> sees

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
follow mode it will guard you if it sees

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
follow mode it will guard you if it sees
enemies<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.630> engage<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.439> it'll

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
enemies that will engage them it'll

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679 
enemies that will engage them it'll
score<00:01:32.130> points<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
score points for you so it's really a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.679 
score points for you so it's really a
very<00:01:34.079> useful<00:01:34.259> tool<00:01:34.590> even<00:01:34.890> outside<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
very useful tool even outside of it so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.450 
very useful tool even outside of it so
the<00:01:36.810> pilots<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.409> titanfall<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:38.070> really

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the pilots and titanfall are really

turning point of seeing that experience

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.420

and<00:03:08.110> knowing<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.500> walk<00:03:08.920> around<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and knowing that I can walk around and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.430 
and knowing that I can walk around and
look<00:03:09.519> around<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.420> environment<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.079> just<00:03:11.290> get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
look around the environment and just get

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.319 
look around the environment and just get
that<00:03:11.560> sense<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:11.980> hey<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.340> real<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> time

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
that sense of hey this real all the time

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.090 
that sense of hey this real all the time
and<00:03:14.140> over<00:03:14.440> time<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.890> sort<00:03:15.070> of

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
and over time I just sort of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860 
and over time I just sort of
internalized<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.880> said<00:03:16.180> we<00:03:16.510> should<00:03:16.690> never

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
internalized that I said we should never

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.440 
internalized that I said we should never
go<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.200> cut<00:03:17.860> scene<00:03:18.070> if<00:03:18.250> possible<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.360> the

go to cut scene if possible so the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
another fds there are features and that

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.650 
another fds there are features and that
i<00:04:20.620> miss<00:04:20.850> because<00:04:21.850> they're<00:04:22.000> not<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.330> game
