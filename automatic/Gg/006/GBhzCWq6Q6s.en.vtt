00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
couple of times I thought it was like

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.990 
couple of times I thought it was like
that's<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.299> key<00:01:46.479> will<00:01:47.350> push<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.700> then<00:01:48.939> you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
that's a key will push it and then you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.459 
that's a key will push it and then you
take<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.299> whole<00:01:49.450> thing<00:01:49.479> but<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.020> realize<00:01:50.350> my

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469
