the most simple one you can do with this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.519 
the most simple one you can do with this
software<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.670> simple<00:00:24.090> rotation<00:00:24.660> for

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
software just a simple rotation for

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
software just a simple rotation for
again<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.310> world<00:00:26.460> warcraft<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.300> just

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
again to just world warcraft they just

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.359 
again to just world warcraft they just
basically<00:00:27.689> record<00:00:28.380> push<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> buttons<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basically record push the buttons and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
basically record push the buttons and
the<00:00:29.910> delays<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.570> automatically<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.410> added

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the delays will automatically be added

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
the delays will automatically be added
in<00:00:32.099> between<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.780> by<00:00:33.930> clicking

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
in between you do this just by clicking

record add in pushing the buttons and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
record add in pushing the buttons and
obviously<00:00:37.890> depending<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> push

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
obviously depending on when you push

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
obviously depending on when you push
them<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> delays<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.590> added

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
them the delays will be added

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
them the delays will be added
accordingly<00:00:41.309> alternatively<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.600> add<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
accordingly alternatively you can add in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
accordingly alternatively you can add in
the<00:00:43.079> delays<00:00:43.379> yourself<00:00:43.800> which<00:00:44.010> means<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.309> can

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the delays yourself which means you can

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
the delays yourself which means you can
tail<00:00:44.820> them<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.210> whatever<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.660> life<00:00:45.809> tool

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
tail them to whatever your life tool

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
tail them to whatever your life tool
which<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:46.950> helpful<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.489> nice

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
the macro assignment box for you there
you<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> add<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.000> short<00:01:09.299> delay<00:01:09.510> now

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you want to add in a short delay now

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
you want to add in a short delay now
which<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.740> 300<00:01:11.400> milliseconds<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.000> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
which about 300 milliseconds you do this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
which about 300 milliseconds you do this
by<00:01:12.299> clicking<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> insert<00:01:13.229> delay<00:01:13.590> button

by clicking on the insert delay button
then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> enter<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> run<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
then you want to enter the run so you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
then you want to enter the run so you
just<00:01:16.350> push<00:01:16.560> enter<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> I'll<00:01:17.220> add<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.490> into

the the box there and then you want to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
the the box there and then you want to
add<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.240> larger<00:01:21.869> delay<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.860> keep<00:01:23.009> clicking

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
add a larger delay so you keep clicking

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
add a larger delay so you keep clicking
the<00:01:23.369> delay<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> add<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> delays<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.900> want

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the delay to add up delays you want

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.999 
the delay to add up delays you want
about<00:01:25.610> 6800<00:01:26.610> millisecond<00:01:27.150> delay<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> how

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
about 6800 millisecond delay this is how

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
about 6800 millisecond delay this is how
long<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.430> takes<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> open<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.540> program

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
long it takes to open up the program

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
long it takes to open up the program
this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.680> water<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:31.950> cutting<00:01:32.220> maybe

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this is for water or cutting maybe

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
this is for water or cutting maybe
slightly<00:01:32.790> different<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:34.259> could

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
slightly different for you you could

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
slightly different for you you could
just<00:01:34.530> mess<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> however<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
just mess about with that however you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.249 
just mess about with that however you
like<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.720> type<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:36.930> password

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like then you just type your password

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
like then you just type your password
and<00:01:38.570> then<00:01:39.570> enter<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.790> obviously<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.880> gonna

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and then enter that obviously it's gonna

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.340 
and then enter that obviously it's gonna
be<00:01:42.090> slightly<00:01:42.390> different<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.810> everybody<00:01:43.020> but

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
be slightly different for everybody but

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.749 
be slightly different for everybody but
roughly<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.340> look<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.579> same

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
roughly it can it's gonna look the same

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.020 
roughly it can it's gonna look the same
as<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.530> show<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
as that I'm going to show you how this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.440 
as that I'm going to show you how this
works<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.540> ok<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.700> keyboard

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
works now ok and if I hit my keyboard

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.370 
works now ok and if I hit my keyboard
here<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> should<00:01:55.799> open<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> program

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.780 

and<00:02:00.840> LogMeIn<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:03.369> really<00:02:03.640> that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
and LogMeIn like so it's really that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.969 
and LogMeIn like so it's really that
simple<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.750> very<00:02:04.869> useful<00:02:05.619> if<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:05.860> a

program need to log into a lot you

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.840 
program need to log into a lot you
should<00:02:08.410> definitely<00:02:08.770> have<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.920> go<00:02:09.160> messing

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
should definitely have a go messing
