00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.189
 well good trip i think 2 episode at 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.589
 rival 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:21.890
 managed to play watch i think 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.710
 coaching staff 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.769
 saw something new again something on 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.109
 works but two are very useful 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.589
 Friendly match was achieved 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.589
 result 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.520
 Well, I am very glad that I debuted for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 national team will work 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.910
 I will say further so that 100 percent 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.880
 happy with myself have work to do 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 always therefore more rather than not 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.960
 Dima well done 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 scored a goal I am very happy for them for a long time 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 this was waiting for a debut for the national team 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 so I think the main thing is coaching that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.240
 he was pleased with him I think dima 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 stayed pretty so hammer legs 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.320
 concrete was serbia's sleep there is slight 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.229
 take a second time scored the winning goal 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.340
 he pretty goal scored his manner possible 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.250
 say from the standard our gate there 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 complexity sociologist I have already said that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 maybe there I can play in another way 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.800
 the moment would be very difficult and therefore if 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.800
 you do n't seem to be at all 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.840
 was there any conversation with the chapel 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 did you manage to understand at all what? 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.420
 impression you made such a conversation 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.550
 personally individually like these 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.160
 conversations were not so I do not really important 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.800
 conversations a bit to trainer to level 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.989
 Places on the field it is now when there was no 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.940
 toss you option group of life 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:31.959
 death groups I looked at all 32 teams 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.410
 4 third basket 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.140
 but not so strong that I don't even 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 I want to guess that is anyway with 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.280
 every basket someone gets and understood 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.830
 that there are first baskets down there suit 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.650
 insanely-powerful team nod Colombia 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 there indis but again in my columbus too 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.540
 very very very good so what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.849
 better look worse let's see here 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 for example option switzerland honduras 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.470
 Algeria 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.590
 Dasha stars first basket 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.420
 Well, if you do, then so we 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340
 I will not mind, I think it is better 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.680
 healthy would like to congratulate the guys 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.629
 who came out to speak 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.250
 with our team at the world championships 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.680
 so you should always be happy about it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.930
 because once you â€™ll get one 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.069
 next time another yes they are the same team 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.659
 so I wish them good luck in the championship 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.920
 peace therefore one must always rejoice and 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.359
 if there are players in the team who will 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.359
 perform at the world championships
