00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.000
 metro 2033 is not just another fps in the packed list of genre games 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.249
 created with a cranial case 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.729
 adventure making itself on the world of the book course of the same name 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.480
 in the role of the resulting gold 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.350
 mission will be to find salvation for the human civilization that after 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
 a nuclear war was forced to live underground 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.889
 to make matters worse is not just radiation misery 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.889
 but also bandits that transcribe the mutations 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.560
 the game's visuals are dark and claustrophobic 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.130
 the narrative concentrates quite an immersion 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 forcing the player to pay attention to the entire universe around them 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.450
 This is not to say that the shooting is not fun 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 on the contrary the game offers several types of weapons that the enemies 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.970
 adapted your strategies by not simply attacking you like crazy 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.380
 the only part now also does an incredible job not just helping 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.620
 to maintain the atmosphere of the universe underground but giving more life to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
 characters that interact as hero 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.710
