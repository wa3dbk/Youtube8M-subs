00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.790
 Welcome my dear ones 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 Today's video is all about that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 emphasize green eyes like here on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 the color circle can see very well 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 the colors are green and green yellow the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 colors red and red violet opposite the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 it is called the complementary colors and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 That's why we work with them exactly 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 to dye 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 I was once with a eyeshadow 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 basis I undertake from mary 2 vr 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 external base and rugby on the whole 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 song in order to avoid that any 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 is fallout so fall down the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.989
 Eyeshadow ruined us the concealer 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.489
 I wear a transparent finishing 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 powder under the eyes and then 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.830
 I really do make several layers 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 need so that nothing can happen 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.130
 to cover redness and blue veins 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 namely of mackie color glasses that is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.860
 a light beige tone and carry it up 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 the entire song 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.750
 then comes one of my absolute 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 favorite colors to use and that is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.380
 from aktiva cranberry if it is green 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.060
 eyes you have to have this color 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.710
 really so trust me there that is so 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.180
 beautiful with green eyes simply because she 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.460
 very much red with trainer because of that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.170
 just fits perfectly and I wear it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.470
 with a very fine brush in the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.520
 I fold it in as well 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 bit in the outer corner of the eye 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:56.420
 so that a form arises then I take 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.500

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.150
 little bit pink with in it and the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.040

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.630
 lid on just want that part 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.630
 beautiful bright and radiant remains 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.840
 anastacia beverly hills and i am like that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.690
 a very bright rosé plankton so one 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 beautiful color perfect for green 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.900
 eyes and the color I carry in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.610
 several layers with a buffer 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.990
 brush from sigma so at least so 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.820
 dab in motion with it the color 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.080
 just nice and intense, I come out 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.760
 Wear it mainly in the outer 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.350
 Eye angle on a little bit 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.940
 high in the eyelet fold when I do that 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.760
 did the whole thing well with blindfolded 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.780
 a big fluffy blending brush 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.130
 Thank you again with naked 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.630
 Write a lunch because we are so kind 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.890
 the brightness is lost and with that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.920
 they like the whole thing again a bit 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.920
 more 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.760
 then I take the gel from bobby brown 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.740
 one in the color black mesh after all 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.330
 that's a very nice engine like 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.990
 The name says so has a lot of purple 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.820
 with it 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.800
 I wear this as close as possible to the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:20.490
 Eyelash wreath and I pull as well 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:22.140
 in the back then a little bit out then 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.640
 I take the color sketch of mac one 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.500
 my absolute favorites a darker one 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 do plums and with that I blind the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 Now I'm painting it out so I'll do it all 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.500
 nice and sad 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.590
 As you can see well, it blinds you 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.480
 Also a bit high in the color 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.190
 I fold the end of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.450
 the lidstick with the lidfold with it 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.709
 a really nice triangular shape 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.819
 arises and quite simply beautiful 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.620
 merges into each other 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.360
 then namely from the glass ambient aua 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.440
 light palette the color in the middle of the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.780
 is a very nice and bright 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.370
 champagne to'n and thus highlight me 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.370
 under the eyebrow and in the corner of the eye 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.049
 to emphasize the lower lash line 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.120
 namely black mosques of bobby again 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.959
 brown and apply as close as possible 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.959
 the eyelashes 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:38.080
 and just like above, I'll take it again 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:39.310
 sketch and country 's color out and about 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.930
 the whole really nice and soft 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.910
 namely to make smoky again that 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:53.950
 the rose of anastacia beverly hills and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:55.210
 Hide the whole thing from here 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.800
 I'm just going to sketchen again 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.240
 and up to the outer corner of the eye 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.150
 to intensify the whole thing 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.800
 because it is not enough for me and again 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.800
 It can never hurt to blab 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.940

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.830
 Powder brush as cheeky away and it works 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.690
 Continue with the teetering around the lips 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.340
