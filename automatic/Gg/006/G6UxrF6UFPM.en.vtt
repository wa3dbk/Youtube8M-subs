00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so easy I always like to find ways to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.560 
so easy I always like to find ways to
save<00:01:30.299> steps<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.560> I've<00:01:31.890> shredded<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.670> my

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
save steps so I've shredded up my

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
save steps so I've shredded up my
chicken<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.219> as<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.610> say<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.969> breast

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
chicken and this is as I say the breast

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.399 
chicken and this is as I say the breast
of<00:01:37.700> 1:1<00:01:38.700> rotisserie<00:01:39.240> chicken<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.899> think<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
of 1:1 rotisserie chicken I think it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.499 
of 1:1 rotisserie chicken I think it
ends<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:40.710> being<00:01:40.950> 2<00:01:41.310> cups<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> chicken<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
ends up being 2 cups of chicken but you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
ends up being 2 cups of chicken but you
don't<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> precise<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
don't have to be that precise here so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.929 
don't have to be that precise here so
now<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.490> makes<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
now what I'm going to do what makes this

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.170 
now what I'm going to do what makes this
recipe<00:01:48.149> such<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> special<00:01:49.680> chicken<00:01:50.399> soup<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
recipe such a special chicken soup is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
recipe such a special chicken soup is
the<00:01:52.140> addition<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.180> lemon<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.200> also

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the addition of lemon and it also

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
the addition of lemon and it also
becomes<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.100> thick<00:01:56.399> soup<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> eggs

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
all together and now when my broth is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.650 
all together and now when my broth is
hot<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:12.740> going<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.070> do<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.700> take<00:03:14.300> about<00:03:14.510> a

turn the egg into scrambled eggs and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.330 
turn the egg into scrambled eggs and
then<00:03:29.090> I'm<00:03:29.240> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.570> add<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:30.140> brothy<00:03:30.860> lemon

then I'm going to add that brothy lemon

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.449 
then I'm going to add that brothy lemon
egg<00:03:31.550> mixture<00:03:31.940> back<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.600> my<00:03:32.750> pot<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:37.100> what<00:03:37.310> I'm

egg mixture back to my pot so what I'm
doing<00:03:37.820> again<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:38.510> just<00:03:38.540> adding<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.560> little

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
doing again is I'm just adding a little

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.900 
doing again is I'm just adding a little
of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.370> hot<00:03:40.580> broth<00:03:41.500> into<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.820> egg<00:03:43.970> mixture

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
of the hot broth into the egg mixture

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.580 
of the hot broth into the egg mixture
whisking<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.239> up<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:50.540> way<00:03:50.810> I'm<00:03:51.230> not

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
whisking that up and that way I'm not

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.040 
whisking that up and that way I'm not
making<00:03:51.980> egg<00:03:52.160> drop<00:03:52.400> soup<00:03:52.570> when<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.980> pour<00:03:54.980> this

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
making egg drop soup when I pour this

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.920 
making egg drop soup when I pour this
tot<00:03:57.050> when<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.709> pour<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.250> into<00:03:58.580> my<00:03:59.320> hot<00:04:00.320> broth

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
tot when I pour this into my hot broth

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.100 
tot when I pour this into my hot broth
it's<00:04:02.930> going<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.260> incorporate<00:04:03.590> really<00:04:04.280> nicely

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.930 

so<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.620> gonna<00:04:11.770> thicken<00:04:12.100> up<00:04:12.340> beautifully

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
so this is gonna thicken up beautifully

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.420 
so this is gonna thicken up beautifully
while<00:04:13.480> that's<00:04:13.810> happening<00:04:14.080> I'm<00:04:14.650> going<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.250> add

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
in the next couple of minutes this is

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.750 
in the next couple of minutes this is
going<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.300> become<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:41.080> nice<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.010> thick<00:04:42.430> you

couple of minutes of making it because
it<00:04:47.080> will<00:04:47.200> keep<00:04:47.410> thickening<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:49.060> won't
