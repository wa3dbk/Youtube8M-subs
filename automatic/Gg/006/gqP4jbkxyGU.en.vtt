and<00:02:14.500> 30s<00:02:14.560> when<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.670> big<00:02:16.239> tobacco<00:02:16.420> companies

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and 30s when the big tobacco companies

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.570 
and 30s when the big tobacco companies
funded<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.690> studies<00:02:20.140> about<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.310> safety

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
funded and the studies about the safety

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.449 
funded and the studies about the safety
of<00:02:21.730> tobacco<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.769> know<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.099> happened

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
of tobacco and we all know what happened

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.640 
of tobacco and we all know what happened
in<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.700> 60s<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.209> 70s<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.840> cancer<00:02:26.230> wards<00:02:26.530> were

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
in the 60s and 70s the cancer wards were

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.800 
in the 60s and 70s the cancer wards were
full<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.690> science<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.989> not<00:02:29.049> as<00:02:29.650> pure<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
full so science is not as pure as you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.860 
full so science is not as pure as you
think<00:02:32.430> science<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.819> bought<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> paid<00:02:34.810> for

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
think science is all bought and paid for

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.619 
think science is all bought and paid for
and<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.160> how<00:02:36.310> scientists<00:02:36.910> earn<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> living

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
and this is how scientists earn a living

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.199 
and this is how scientists earn a living
they<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.590> get<00:02:38.799> grants<00:02:39.310> that's<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.940> fact

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
they they get grants that's just a fact

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.199 
they they get grants that's just a fact
that's<00:02:40.510> how<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.780> world<00:02:41.080> works<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> anyway

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
that's how the world works so anyway

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.120 
that's how the world works so anyway
