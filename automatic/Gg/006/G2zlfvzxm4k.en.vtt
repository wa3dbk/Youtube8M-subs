pretty<00:01:31.010> slow<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:33.770> heat<00:01:33.950> really

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
pretty slow on it so the heat really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.840 
pretty slow on it so the heat really
warm<00:01:34.430> will<00:01:35.150> soak<00:01:35.780> them<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.340> usually<00:01:37.340> wait<00:01:37.820> for

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
warm will soak them I usually wait for

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.420 
warm will soak them I usually wait for
like<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:38.420> smoke<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.530> know<00:01:39.590> has<00:01:39.920> really

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
like this smoke and I know has really

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.520 
like this smoke and I know has really
bad<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:40.820> your<00:01:40.910> hair<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.290> all<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.500> time

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
bad for your hair but it all the time

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.080 
bad for your hair but it all the time
and<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.160> doesn't<00:01:43.369> really<00:01:43.460> damage<00:01:43.790> my<00:01:43.880> hair<00:01:43.910> a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and it doesn't really damage my hair a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.170 
and it doesn't really damage my hair a
lot<00:01:44.979> so<00:01:45.979> no<00:01:47.740> just<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.369> couple<00:01:49.490> times

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.680 

then<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.420> your<00:01:55.540> hair<00:01:55.780> spray<00:01:56.130> I'd<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.340> this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.470 

and<00:02:11.810> undo<00:02:12.439> it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.340 

and<00:02:21.019> there<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:21.500> go

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.510
