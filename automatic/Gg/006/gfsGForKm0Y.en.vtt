windows application and although it may
seem<00:00:59.200> like<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.680> long<00:00:59.980> process<00:01:00.310> initially<00:01:01.150> you

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
seem like a long process initially you

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.810 
seem like a long process initially you
only<00:01:01.870> need<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.290> do<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.470> once<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:03.550> very

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
only need to do this once and it is very

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.189 
only need to do this once and it is very
good<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.180> walking<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.660> through<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.020> process

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
good and walking you through the process

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.080 
good and walking you through the process
of<00:01:05.590> connecting<00:01:05.920> for<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.370> first<00:01:06.610> time<00:01:06.820> and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
of connecting for the first time and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.450 
of connecting for the first time and
after<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.230> connecting<00:01:08.770> becomes<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.190> cinch

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
after that connecting becomes a cinch

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.370 
after that connecting becomes a cinch
and<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.850> will<00:01:10.030> let<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.330> connect<00:01:10.660> through<00:01:10.900> USB

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
and it will let you connect through USB

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.940 
and it will let you connect through USB
or<00:01:11.710> Wi-Fi<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.970> let's<00:01:13.180> connect<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.740> mobizen<00:01:14.740> has

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
or Wi-Fi so let's connect it mobizen has

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.680 
or Wi-Fi so let's connect it mobizen has
a<00:01:14.979> background<00:01:15.250> service<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:16.030> runs<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.540> when

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
a background service that runs so when

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.660 
a background service that runs so when

and while is backing up you could still

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.170 
and while is backing up you could still
use<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.140> phone<00:02:47.370> now<00:02:48.370> i<00:02:48.400> must<00:02:48.760> stress<00:02:49.030> that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
use the phone now i must stress that

use the phone now i must stress that
this<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.959> going<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.260> back<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.680> your<00:02:50.709> data

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
this is not going to back up your data

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.860 
this is not going to back up your data
for<00:02:51.459> example<00:02:51.549> if<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.209> backup<00:02:52.480> your<00:02:52.660> apps

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
for example if you backup your apps

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.520 
for example if you backup your apps
uninstall<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.310> app<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:55.000> restore<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.720> you

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
uninstall the app then restore it you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.530 
uninstall the app then restore it you
can<00:02:56.680> see<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.430> skips<00:02:57.940> through<00:02:58.060> all<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
can see that it skips through all the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.020 
can see that it skips through all the
ones<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.380> installed<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.820> will

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
ones that you have installed and it will

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.770 
ones that you have installed and it will
restore<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.630> app<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.320> not<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.950> data<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.540> for

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
restore the app but not the data so for

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.050 
restore the app but not the data so for
example<00:03:04.870> if<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.829> game<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.310> will<00:03:06.609> lose<00:03:06.820> all
