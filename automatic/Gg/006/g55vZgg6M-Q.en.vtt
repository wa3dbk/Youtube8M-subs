because<00:01:04.220> water<00:01:04.580> budem<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.210> nicely<00:01:05.479> go

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
because water budem just nicely go

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.600 
because water budem just nicely go
through<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.290> whole<00:01:06.470> system<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.070> fill<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.460> up

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
through the whole system and fill it up

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.770 
through the whole system and fill it up
I<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.170> get<00:01:09.380> clogged<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.689> what<00:01:11.689> you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
I this will get clogged and what you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.560 
I this will get clogged and what you
need<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.049> do<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.770> feel<00:01:13.039> your<00:01:13.490> reservoir<00:01:14.060> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
need to do you feel your reservoir and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.219 
need to do you feel your reservoir and
stuck<00:01:15.469> your<00:01:15.649> pump<00:01:16.570> push<00:01:17.570> water<00:01:17.810> through<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
stuck your pump push water through the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.480 
stuck your pump push water through the
system<00:01:18.439> feel<00:01:19.070> more<00:01:20.350> stop<00:01:21.350> pump<00:01:21.590> again<00:01:21.979> feel

system feel more stop pump again feel

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.609 
system feel more stop pump again feel
more<00:01:22.759> feel<00:01:23.000> more<00:01:23.030> than<00:01:23.420> what<00:01:23.600> you'll<00:01:23.899> all<00:01:24.200> air

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
more feel more than what you'll all air

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.550 
more feel more than what you'll all air
get<00:01:24.950> escape<00:01:25.399> from<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.789> system<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.329> you<00:01:26.659> get

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.849 

what<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:31.030> completely<00:01:32.030> filled<00:01:32.649> your<00:01:33.649> water

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
what of completely filled your water

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.620 
what of completely filled your water
cooling<00:01:34.219> setup<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.820> after<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.479> can

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
cooling setup and after that you can

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.289 
cooling setup and after that you can
start<00:01:35.689> bleeding<00:01:36.109> process<00:01:36.789> so<00:01:37.789> let's<00:01:38.119> see<00:01:38.270> how

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
start bleeding process so let's see how

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.039 
start bleeding process so let's see how
things<00:01:38.750> will<00:01:38.960> go<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.579> see<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.240> feel<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
things will go so you can see I feel the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.130 
things will go so you can see I feel the
reservoirs<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.979> such<00:01:43.850> ways<00:01:44.119> is<00:01:44.359> full<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.899> water

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
reservoirs in such ways is full of water

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.550 
reservoirs in such ways is full of water
right<00:01:45.350> now<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:46.670> pipes<00:01:47.630> most<00:01:48.109> of<00:01:48.289> them<00:01:48.439> I

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
right now so this pipes most of them I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.099 
right now so this pipes most of them I
empty<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.399> 0<00:01:49.429> is<00:01:49.909> full<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.509> what<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.929> doesn't

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
empty the 0 is full so what it doesn't

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.380 
empty the 0 is full so what it doesn't
go<00:01:51.350> any<00:01:51.380> further<00:01:51.859> so<00:01:52.549> that<00:01:52.759> will<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:52.969> now<00:01:53.149> i

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
go any further so that will do now i

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.440 
go any further so that will do now i
connect<00:01:54.170> my<00:01:54.259> pump<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.700> external<00:01:56.090> power

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
connect my pump to the external power

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.919 
connect my pump to the external power
supply<00:01:56.719> it<00:01:57.560> will<00:01:58.009> push<00:01:58.249> this<00:01:58.820> water<00:01:59.179> in<00:01:59.509> this

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
supply it will push this water in this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.889 
supply it will push this water in this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.340 
reservoir sort of the system and get air
out<00:02:03.170> with<00:02:03.499> you<00:02:03.619> see<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.100> bubbles<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:04.520> go

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
out with you see the bubbles will go

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.100 
out with you see the bubbles will go
through<00:02:06.350> them<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.549> reservoir<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.450> when

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
through them so the reservoir and when

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.800 
through them so the reservoir and when
what<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:09.830> be<00:02:10.039> all<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.460> place<00:02:11.180> by<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.510> air<00:02:11.780> I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
what it will be all a place by the air I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.660 
what it will be all a place by the air I
can<00:02:12.230> put<00:02:12.440> more<00:02:12.620> water<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.040> repeat<00:02:13.490> process

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
can put more water and repeat process

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.510 
can put more water and repeat process
again<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.300> again<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.140> let's<00:02:15.680> see<00:02:16.010> what's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
again and again so let's see what's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.180 
again and again so let's see what's
happened<00:02:17.150> when<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.360> push<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.930> on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.330

you see water went there and now all

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:44.030 
you see water went there and now all
ears<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.540> pushing<00:02:27.730> through<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.820> system

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.920 

right<00:02:44.790> empty<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.140> stop<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.060> now<00:02:48.060> we'll<00:02:48.599> put

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
right empty so stop and now we'll put

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.020 
right empty so stop and now we'll put
more<00:02:49.349> water<00:02:49.469> and<00:02:49.829> see<00:02:50.430> how<00:02:50.909> things<00:02:51.239> will<00:02:51.540> go<00:02:51.569> oh

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
more water and see how things will go oh

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.910 
more water and see how things will go oh
if<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.450> wouldn't<00:02:54.719> take<00:02:54.900> too<00:02:55.109> long<00:02:55.260> time<00:02:55.560> I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
if it wouldn't take too long time I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.890 
if it wouldn't take too long time I
wouldn't<00:02:56.489> switch<00:02:56.730> camera<00:02:57.120> off<00:02:59.239> but<00:03:00.239> just<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
wouldn't switch camera off but just to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.940 
wouldn't switch camera off but just to
show<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.170> how<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.790> process<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.450> going<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.829> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
show you how the process is going if it

show you how the process is going if it
will<00:03:05.159> be<00:03:05.310> long<00:03:05.579> i'll<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.659> cut<00:03:06.900> it

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.149 

alright<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.510> now<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.720> see<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.500> reservoir<00:03:35.040> is

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.319 
alright so now you see the reservoir is
full<00:03:35.189> again<00:03:36.950> putting<00:03:37.950> pump<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:41.030> push<00:03:42.030> more

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329

air<00:03:42.569> out<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.290> system

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.360 

while<00:03:50.720> you're<00:03:50.900> doing<00:03:51.020> this<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.770> doesn't<00:03:52.010> hurt

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
while you're doing this it doesn't hurt

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.010 
while you're doing this it doesn't hurt
to<00:03:52.490> see<00:03:52.910> if<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.270> have<00:03:53.510> any<00:03:53.690> leaking<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:56.020> don't

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
to see if you have any leaking I don't

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.680 
to see if you have any leaking I don't
see<00:03:57.230> any<00:03:57.410> right<00:03:57.680> now<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.400> those<00:03:59.240> paper<00:03:59.570> towels

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
that i put here will help to find out

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.760 
that i put here will help to find out
when<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.000> not<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.360> obvious<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:06.470> for<00:04:06.650> now

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
when it's not that obvious but for now

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.010 
when it's not that obvious but for now
seems<00:04:07.070> okay<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:10.060> well<00:04:11.060> that's<00:04:11.480> pretty<00:04:11.750> much

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
seems okay and well that's pretty much

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.640 
seems okay and well that's pretty much
it<00:04:12.260> as<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:13.250> can<00:04:13.459> see<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:14.720> doesn't<00:04:15.140> mean<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
it as I can see it it doesn't mean the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.060 
it as I can see it it doesn't mean the
system<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.160> believed<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.940> it's<00:04:17.720> not<00:04:17.989> but<00:04:18.890> it's

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
system is believed it it's not but it's

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.280 
system is believed it it's not but it's
good<00:04:19.280> enough<00:04:20.200> try<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:22.240> power<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.720> computer<00:04:24.110> up

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
good enough try to power the computer up

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.590 
good enough try to power the computer up
and<00:04:24.590> see<00:04:24.860> if<00:04:25.280> actually<00:04:25.790> hits<00:04:25.970> it's<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.390> life<00:04:26.570> or

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and see if actually hits it's a life or

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.420 
and see if actually hits it's a life or
not<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:29.110> see<00:04:30.110> if<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.530> broke<00:04:30.740> anything<00:04:31.190> on

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
not and and see if I broke anything on

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.730 
not and and see if I broke anything on
the<00:04:31.550> way<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.540> will<00:04:32.840> be<00:04:32.870> back<00:04:33.110> with<00:04:33.169> all

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
the way so I will be back with all

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.340 
the way so I will be back with all
connections
