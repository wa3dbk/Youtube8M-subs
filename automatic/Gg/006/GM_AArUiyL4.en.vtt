00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
takes a while to get used to the taste

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.580 
takes a while to get used to the taste
of<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.600> opti<00:06:14.600> past<00:06:14.810> and<00:06:15.260> I<00:06:17.050> was<00:06:18.050> pretty<00:06:18.350> rough

of the opti past and I was pretty rough

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.520 
of the opti past and I was pretty rough
for<00:06:19.160> the<00:06:19.430> first<00:06:20.440> four<00:06:21.440> or<00:06:21.590> five<00:06:21.740> days<00:06:23.410> it<00:06:24.410> was

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
for the first four or five days it was

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.280 
for the first four or five days it was
pretty<00:06:24.680> bad<00:06:24.860> but<00:06:25.690> once<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.840> get<00:06:26.960> over<00:06:27.020> that

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
pretty bad but once you get over that

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:36.280 
pretty bad but once you get over that
hump<00:06:28.630> it<00:06:29.630> gets<00:06:29.840> a<00:06:29.990> lot<00:06:30.200> easier<00:06:30.710> and<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.960> payoff

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
hump it gets a lot easier and the payoff

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.900
