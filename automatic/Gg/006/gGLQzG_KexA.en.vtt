00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the new season is in full swing 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.650
 game rule changes are actually there 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.390
 not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 but there is a different interpretation 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 from the offside rule that 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 offside has been the last few years 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.000
 more often adapted players were penalized 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 if she actually played the ball or 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 a duel with an opponent a4 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 that led to confusing situations and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 that's why the fifa is with a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 Clarification that we clear 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.430
 is put on paper as follows 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 a player who is in offside position 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.019
 stays and stays ahead 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 We too will be punished if he is clear 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.489
 tries to play a ball where we are 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 action influenced an opponent and that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 ball is also in his neighborhood that is from 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 importance and to get a clear picture of that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 have the following example 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 bouquets of beautiful sham 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 focused on stem cells 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.489
 Google from directly if the ball is allowed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.350
 man i put it i don't like it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.270
 Here you can see that at the moment the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.399
 ball is being played and attacks from 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 excelsior offside 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 it's hard to see but we go 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 assume that you are at the game 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 then it is also wait and see what goes 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.030
 he do 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.939
 then in the situation afterwards 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.189
 more visible if your ball is close to him 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.890
 along a role that he has a clear 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 attempt to play that role 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 he doesn't hit him so was last year 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.150
 that reason to say he touches 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.159
 not him 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.560
 no offside now it gets a face 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.869
 he handled the new interpretation 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.390
 makes a clear attempt to ball 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.640
 play that ball close to him and his 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.799
 action influences his action 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.210
 opponent and defend or one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.040
 goalkeeper 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.140
 so for that reason goal must be scored 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.140
 rejected offside 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.280
 harting that the ball is certainly equally human 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.280
 made target so 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.730
 this is the moment that the ball becomes 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.320
 played at this time must be the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.660
 judge an assistant 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.160
 whether there is any belly play visible 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.380
 is that there is a Heerenveen player 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.210
 offside and then there must be a moment 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 waited to be able to judge 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.760
 whether the ball comes close to him or you the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.610
 trying to play the ball and / or doing so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.120
 defend an opponent and goalkeeper 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.430
 what interferes with or influences in his game 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.590
 we then see that that is not the case 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.260
 is and let that ball pass 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 does not stand in the way, he stands there 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 also not close so no 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.290
 rejection of this ailment 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.959
 last year or not happened calling 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.620
 approved and also with the current one 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.209
 interpretation a new interpretation 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.209
 is a valid goal 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.620
 is the offside run yes 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.830
 So which should nevertheless yes of course does 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.880
 4624 as possible 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.520
 then not that is broken 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 of the store rules by heerenveen 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.780
 god just needs the whole laundry nothing 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.910
 it is outside here 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 I can smell the oil in particular throughout the country 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.530
 of vitesse so may i want you of course 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 in this situation the offside position is 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.450
 equally difficult to observe but 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 ultimately the presenter is the one 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.940
 very good out here is out of the question 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.600
 offside because the ball is not around 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.910
 is 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.190
 the opponent does not enter into a duel 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.650
 that attacker who runs the ball 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.959
 is offside but here this nobody 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.520
 does not enter a duel so you can go here 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.620
 referee simply by letting play 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.230
 that was last year so from there he goes 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.780
 reporter fine explanation and also 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
 the new interpretation this is not a dive 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.350
 game 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.410
 second thing they put on paper is that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.480
 I read it again for the outdoor game 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.310
 stand the player and clear action 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 undertakes the possibility of a 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 opponent to play the ball 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.970
 it is a different situation 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.080
 we would have some examples there 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:03.120
 of 9 7 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.450
 is it what it is to keep things up 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.310
 set 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.080
 outside set that is can not be 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.500
 man who gets the ball not for him but 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.810
 for those who hinders the opponent 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.190
 in this situation it is visible that on it 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.810
 moment the ball is played a 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.269
 attacks from vitesse offside 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.729
 he is therefore quite far from the ball 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.830
 you would say that is not offside 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.540
 but what is visible and then you must 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.900
 good looking but it is visible is that 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.970
 he with an running action an opponent 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.200
 hinders the ability to get involved 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.270
 to come ashore 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.610
 last year we said that's none 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.740
 offside but with the current explanation 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.810
 which clearly states that he is a 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.550
 take clear action that the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.729
 possibility of an opponent walt 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.110
 player affected you have to like it 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.830
 label offside 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.830
 we do that now 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.059
 movies with much-discussed situation 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.539
 feyenoord psv 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:06.969
 when the young ball heads 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.359
 state and psv clearly play offside 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:13.479
 stands for that type according to the 

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:13.989
 Way out last year handling plays 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.849
 he wasn't there 

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:18.909
 he does not obscure the keeper 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.959
 he will not duel for the ball 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.639
 some discussion that 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:23.289
 then last and answers came through the 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.139
 liberty that keeper to not there 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.319
 but that was not the last year 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.899
 so ask again last year 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.879
 face prescription sweets with the current 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:36.909
 explanation of the rules are given yes 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.259
 He certainly hindered in goalkeeper 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.199
 are possibilities to get to the ball 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.809
 gone so it is with the game 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.439
 so this situation now different too 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.439
 be explained
