00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.810
 turn 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520
 We 're going to mess around, I do not know it's a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.880
 moment you are going to ask the flour is 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.880

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 this agent to incorporate to treat this 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.630
 mass to leave the mass much smoother 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.480
 is very hot to the point of mass and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.600
