00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.200 
is thin as I think it is measure is
about<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.490> bit<00:00:29.609> more<00:00:29.760> than<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> quarter

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
about a little bit more than a quarter

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.870 
about a little bit more than a quarter
of<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.539> inch<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:31.109> terms<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> height<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
of an inch in terms of height and it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.940 
of an inch in terms of height and it's
actually<00:00:33.059> thinner<00:00:33.510> than<00:00:33.780> ipad<00:00:33.899> mini<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
actually thinner than ipad mini so the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
actually thinner than ipad mini so the
design<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> sets<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> apart<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.170> i<00:00:37.260> mean

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
design kind of sets it apart can i mean

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
design kind of sets it apart can i mean
there's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.680> there's<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.399> gigantic

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
there's a lot there's there's a gigantic

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
design definitely sets it apart what

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.410 
design definitely sets it apart what
else<00:00:43.200> sets<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> tablet<00:00:44.070> z<00:00:44.219> apart<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.940> first

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
how gorgeous the screen is so we use HD

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.560 
how gorgeous the screen is so we use HD
screen<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> 1920<00:00:52.020> x<00:00:52.140> 1200<00:00:52.530> resolution

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
screen this is 1920 x 1200 resolution

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.450 
screen this is 1920 x 1200 resolution
the<00:00:54.570> screen<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.440> supports<00:00:56.070> wire

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the screen actually supports wire

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
the screen actually supports wire
jamming<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.210> colors<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> compare<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
jamming of colors so if you compare it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
jamming of colors so if you compare it
to<00:00:59.010> ipad<00:00:59.430> ipad<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.030> example<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.660> supports

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to ipad ipad for example it supports

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
to ipad ipad for example it supports
twenty<00:01:01.800> percent<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.250> color<00:01:02.520> than<00:01:02.789> ipad<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
twenty percent more color than ipad so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
twenty percent more color than ipad so
you<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.949> gorgeous<00:01:05.100> photos

there's i guess a picture of a black
wall<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.060> something<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> look<00:01:20.340> at

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
wall or something so when you look at

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
wall or something so when you look at
the<00:01:20.490> picture<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.090> you'll<00:01:21.780> notice<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> the

the picture here you'll notice that the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
the picture here you'll notice that the
green<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:23.070> looks<00:01:23.759> greener<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> pop

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
green look looks greener actually a pop

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
green look looks greener actually a pop
setting<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> supports

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
setting up and it's because it supports

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
setting up and it's because it supports
more<00:01:27.060> colors<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> you've<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.439> taken

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
more colors and you've actually taken

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
more colors and you've actually taken
some<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.220> bravia<00:01:29.909> technology<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
some of the bravia technology from the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.080 
some of the bravia technology from the
HD<00:01:30.990> TVs<00:01:31.409> impact<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> inside<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> fantasy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
HD TVs impact it inside of the fantasy

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.380 
HD TVs impact it inside of the fantasy
yes<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.950> took<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.579> Bravia<00:01:35.909> Engine<00:01:35.939> 2

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
yes so we took the Bravia Engine 2

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.780 
yes so we took the Bravia Engine 2
processor<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.259> our<00:01:37.470> TVs<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
processor from our TVs and it's it's

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
processor from our TVs and it's it's
it's<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> tablet<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> does<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's in the tablet and what it does is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
it's in the tablet and what it does is
it<00:01:40.829> optimizes<00:01:41.729> picture<00:01:42.150> quality<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.869> adjusts

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it optimizes picture quality it adjusts

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
it optimizes picture quality it adjusts
contrast<00:01:44.040> sharpness<00:01:44.520> brightness<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
contrast sharpness brightness so the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.109 
contrast sharpness brightness so the
pictures<00:01:46.649> look<00:01:46.860> great<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.430> matter<00:01:47.460> what
