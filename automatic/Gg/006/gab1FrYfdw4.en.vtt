00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
hey wassup guys here's the problem I

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey wassup guys here's the problem I
have

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
have

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.030 
have
I<00:00:05.459> installed<00:00:06.269> my<00:00:06.479> LEDs<00:00:07.220> on<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.400> side<00:00:09.080> and<00:00:10.080> on

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
I installed my LEDs on the side and on

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.150 
I installed my LEDs on the side and on
the<00:00:11.250> under<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.209> tail<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.039> pretty<00:00:14.039> much

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the under the tail and pretty much

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
the under the tail and pretty much
here's<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> phone<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:16.010> have<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.310> remote<00:00:18.439> this<00:00:19.439> one

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
here's a phone I have a remote this one

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.509 
here's a phone I have a remote this one
and<00:00:20.099> as<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.920> lights<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.340> not

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and as you can see the lights are not

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:41.300 
and as you can see the lights are not
working<00:00:29.150> I'm<00:00:30.150> gonna<00:00:30.359> take<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> seat<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:40.310> you

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
working I'm gonna take the seat out you

00:00:41.310 --> 00:01:01.730 
working I'm gonna take the seat out you
can<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:52.400> looks<00:00:58.370> all<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.540> LEDs<00:01:00.540> are<00:01:01.050> plug

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
can see it looks all the LEDs are plug

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.160 
can see it looks all the LEDs are plug
in<00:01:01.950> play<00:01:02.720> like<00:01:03.720> this<00:01:03.960> one's<00:01:05.539> right<00:01:06.539> so<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.929> got

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
in play like this one's right so I got

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.590 
in play like this one's right so I got
like<00:01:07.350> six<00:01:08.899> wires<00:01:09.899> from<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> LEDs<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.609> they

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
like six wires from the LEDs and they

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600 
like six wires from the LEDs and they
all<00:01:12.689> come

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:26.420 

to<00:01:16.210> warn<00:01:16.600> wire<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.820> goes<00:01:22.650> here

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.850 

so<00:01:27.030> pretty<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:28.220> six<00:01:29.220> wires<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.940> LEDs

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
so pretty much six wires from the LEDs

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.230 
so pretty much six wires from the LEDs
become<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.910> plug<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.450> play<00:01:33.660> clip

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
become one with this plug in play clip

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.670 
become one with this plug in play clip
so<00:01:36.240> here's<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.190> black<00:01:38.190> wire<00:01:41.030> here's<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.680> fuse

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so here's the black wire here's the fuse

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.050 
so here's the black wire here's the fuse
glass<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:45.620> this<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.160> white<00:01:47.370> one<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
glass and this is the white one is the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.200 
glass and this is the white one is the
antenna<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> pretty<00:01:50.760> much<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
antenna and this is pretty much the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.400 
antenna and this is pretty much the
control<00:01:51.810> box<00:01:53.480> so<00:01:54.480> what<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.690> did<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:57.410> plugged

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
control box so what I did was I plugged

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.560 
control box so what I did was I plugged
the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.210 
the
wire<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> positive<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.190> battery

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
wire to the positive side of the battery

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.630 
wire to the positive side of the battery
and<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:04.050> black<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.660> negative<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and the black one to the negative to the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.140 
and the black one to the negative to the
battery<00:02:09.200> now<00:02:10.250> since<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:11.730> working<00:02:12.300> right

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
battery now since it's not working right

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.620 
battery now since it's not working right
now

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630

fuse and I'm gonna put it back in right
now<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:31.580> is<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.849> testers

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.430 

okay<00:04:03.470> I've<00:04:03.940> unplug<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.570> plug<00:04:05.830> this<00:04:06.830> in

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.910 

i<00:04:09.470> unplug<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.580> plug<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.380> which<00:04:12.380> is<00:04:12.590> which

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
i unplug and plug this in which is which

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.000 
i unplug and plug this in which is which
was<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.340> fuse<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.410> now<00:04:15.410> we've<00:04:15.680> got<00:04:15.830> control

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
was the fuse and now we've got control

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.810 
was the fuse and now we've got control
remote<00:04:17.320> this<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:19.989> now<00:04:20.989> they<00:04:21.200> worse

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
remote this one now they worse

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:37.900 
remote this one now they worse
see<00:04:22.820> what<00:04:22.940> I'm<00:04:23.030> saying<00:04:25.570> no<00:04:26.570> they<00:04:26.780> were

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.200 

now<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.860> leave<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.220> like<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:41.060> like

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
now if I leave it on like that for like

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
now if I leave it on like that for like
the<00:04:41.690> next<00:04:41.720> three<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:42.290> four<00:04:42.410> hours<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:44.360> know<00:04:44.540> it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
the next three or four hours you know it

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.020 
the next three or four hours you know it
won't<00:04:45.410> work<00:04:45.680> again<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.340> would<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.850> like

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
won't work again so I would have to like

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
won't work again so I would have to like
reset<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.690> again<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.690> don't<00:04:50.690> know<00:04:50.750> if<00:04:50.900> I

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
reset it again so I don't know if I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.430 
reset it again so I don't know if I
should<00:04:51.520> make<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.580> switch<00:04:53.000> with<00:04:53.780> an<00:04:53.930> on<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.350> on

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
should make a switch with an on and on

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.650 
should make a switch with an on and on
switch<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.100> forget<00:04:56.030> about<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.570> remote<00:04:57.370> and

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
switch and forget about the remote and

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.400 
switch and forget about the remote and
the<00:04:59.660> features<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.530> has<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:03.230> the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
the features the has like this like the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.120 
the features the has like this like the
