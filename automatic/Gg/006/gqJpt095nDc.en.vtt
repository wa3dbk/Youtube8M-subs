00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.000

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.420

 these owners as I said and then 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.460
 inside the unions there is what would be 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.910
 all of these spanair and what they would be 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.180
 these chests as you can see each level 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.300

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.390
 has enough resources in what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.430
 would be the chests and enough spanair not 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.730
 as we are getting to the part of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.020
 above 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.120
 this will increase in what will be inside 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.780
 the chests and all that and we can 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.020
 find what armor chairs would be 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.020
 riding 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.650
 all that what is found in what 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.270
 would be the owners and not also in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.970
 what would be in the up part 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.880
 is what would be a boss is 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.020
 a bit difficult but well no no no 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.000
 nothing and this there are two three but then if 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.430
 it would cause us a little work 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.630
 kill him not and how can you see if they are 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.630
 enough floors 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.880
 what these wyn jones have are like 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.950
 14 I think so and as I said 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.920
 as we are getting to the part of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.550
 to go up gradually increase the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.070
 objects that are in in these 2 jones and 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.750
 then there are also what are unions of 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.200
 stone never stone mosses a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.300
 of sand there are quite a few as you can see 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.460
 this the boss already broke what would be the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.440
 top part and then in the chest that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.310
 there were enough diamonds 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.709
 they do not stop falling see there is and are 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.890
 falling enough diamonds and then this one 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.080
 I would be the boss and I do not know if it is a failure 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.590
 of this version of minecraft which is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.560
