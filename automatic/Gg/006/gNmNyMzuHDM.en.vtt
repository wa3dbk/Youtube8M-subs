00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
first off let's break down our fret

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
first off let's break down our fret
board<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.410> 0<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> 12<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.059> further

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
board from 0 to 12 now we can further

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.430 
board from 0 to 12 now we can further
break<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> down<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.110> three<00:00:37.410> different

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
break that down into three different

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.840 
break that down into three different
sections<00:00:38.120> four<00:00:39.120> frets<00:00:39.480> each<00:00:39.780> frets<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.430> two

section so what we're gonna do is let's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
section so what we're gonna do is let's
try<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> find<00:00:53.699> three<00:00:54.329> different<00:00:54.750> chords<00:00:55.020> on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
try to find three different chords on

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
try to find three different chords on
each<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:56.730> sections<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.570> for
