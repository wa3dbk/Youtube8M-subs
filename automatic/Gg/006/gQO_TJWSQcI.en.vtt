more<00:03:11.830> than<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.099> hatchet<00:03:12.519> noticeably<00:03:13.299> worn

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
more than the hatchet noticeably worn

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.039 
more than the hatchet noticeably worn
maybe<00:03:14.590> not<00:03:14.769> quite<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.010> bit<00:03:15.220> more<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:16.750> still

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
maybe not quite a bit more it's still

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.750 
maybe not quite a bit more it's still
light<00:03:17.260> enough<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.590> pack<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.130> day<00:03:18.280> pack<00:03:18.549> I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
light enough to pack in a day pack I

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.180 
light enough to pack in a day pack I
probably<00:03:19.060> won't<00:03:19.390> want<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.140> be<00:03:20.290> all<00:03:20.890> night

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
probably won't want this to be all night

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.370 
probably won't want this to be all night
dealt<00:03:21.400> all<00:03:21.580> day<00:03:21.790> I'd<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> put<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.110> up<00:03:23.319> in

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
dealt all day I'd want to put this up in

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:47.720 
dealt all day I'd want to put this up in
a<00:03:23.500> pack<00:03:23.739> or<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> long<00:03:26.049> carry

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.839 

what<00:03:48.730> is<00:03:48.819> efficient<00:03:49.300> than<00:03:49.989> shopping<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.500> think

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
what is efficient than shopping I think

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.740 
what is efficient than shopping I think
but<00:03:51.849> it's<00:03:52.120> very<00:03:52.480> clean<00:03:53.970> without<00:03:54.970> saying<00:03:55.239> that

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
but it's very clean without saying that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.690 
but it's very clean without saying that
because<00:03:57.660> shopping<00:03:58.660> with<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.989> however<00:03:59.860> it<00:04:00.489> is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
because shopping with this however it is

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.770 
because shopping with this however it is
a<00:04:00.819> very<00:04:01.090> good<00:04:01.330> shopper<00:04:01.569> still<00:04:02.019> maybe<00:04:02.890> even<00:04:03.780> if

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
a very good shopper still maybe even if

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.890 
a very good shopper still maybe even if
I<00:04:05.440> was<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.680> work<00:04:06.489> on<00:04:06.700> my<00:04:06.849> technique<00:04:07.480> with<00:04:07.870> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
I was to work on my technique with a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.620 
I was to work on my technique with a
little<00:04:08.200> bit<00:04:08.319> more<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:09.250> might<00:04:09.579> rival<00:04:10.239> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
little bit more it might rival the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.850 
little bit more it might rival the
hatchet<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:12.220> certainly<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:13.860> bit

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
hatchet it so it certainly is a bit

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.879 
hatchet it so it certainly is a bit
quicker<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.430> seems<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.299> each<00:04:16.479> cut<00:04:16.900> cuts

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
quicker it seems is that each cut cuts

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.960 
quicker it seems is that each cut cuts
much<00:04:18.250> better<00:04:19.019> than<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.139> hatchet

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
much better than the hatchet

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.420 
much better than the hatchet
the<00:04:21.970> other<00:04:22.180> advantage<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.950> take<00:04:24.250> it

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
the other advantage is you can take it

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.659 
the other advantage is you can take it
and<00:04:24.639> use<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.479> for<00:04:25.590> debarking<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:29.340> I'm<00:04:30.340> sure<00:04:30.490> to

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
and use it for debarking and I'm sure to

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.820 
and use it for debarking and I'm sure to
excel<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> D<00:04:31.270> living<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.110> same<00:04:34.830> even

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
excel it D living just the same even

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.240 
excel it D living just the same even
being<00:04:36.039> able<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.310> take<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.950> on<00:04:38.950> its<00:04:39.160> side

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
being able to take it it's on its side

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.279 
being able to take it it's on its side
and<00:04:40.830> be<00:04:41.830> barking<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.400> way<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.960> big<00:04:44.110> it's

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
and be barking this way it's a big it's

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.400 
and be barking this way it's a big it's
pretty<00:04:44.560> useful<00:04:44.950> if<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.340> ever<00:04:45.490> need<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.729> to

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
pretty useful if you ever need it to

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.510 
pretty useful if you ever need it to
strip<00:04:48.210> but<00:04:49.210> as<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:49.510> notice<00:04:50.099> just<00:04:51.099> like<00:04:51.220> the

strip but as you notice just like the

strip but as you notice just like the

weighs<00:05:04.780> quite<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.740> bit<00:05:05.979> less<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.610> only<00:05:06.729> weighs

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
weighs quite a bit less it only weighs

weighs quite a bit less it only weighs
19<00:05:07.389> ounces<00:05:07.800> almost<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:09.400> think<00:05:09.700> it's<00:05:10.060> around<00:05:10.150> 10

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
19 ounces almost I think it's around 10

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.750 
19 ounces almost I think it's around 10
ounces<00:05:10.810> less<00:05:11.080> even<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:13.889> either<00:05:14.889> is<00:05:15.070> quite<00:05:15.729> a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
ounces less even so either is quite a

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.279 
ounces less even so either is quite a
bit<00:05:15.970> more<00:05:16.000> comparable<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.780> hatchet<00:05:17.139> in

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
bit more comparable to the hatchet in

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.510 
bit more comparable to the hatchet in
size<00:05:17.760> however<00:05:18.760> if<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.240> notice

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
size however if you notice

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.320 
size however if you notice
it's<00:05:21.030> not<00:05:21.419> as<00:05:21.600> weight<00:05:21.780> forward<00:05:22.110> as<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:24.090> in

to it if that's a good term but although

the branch is getting skinnier

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.249 
the branch is getting skinnier
it<00:05:43.919> still<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.789> able<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.210> chop<00:05:45.419> so<00:05:45.690> long<00:05:45.870> as<00:05:46.080> you

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
it still is able to chop so long as you

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.189 
it still is able to chop so long as you
use<00:05:47.039> the<00:05:47.310> appropriate<00:05:47.610> part<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:48.569> blade<00:05:48.810> to

use the appropriate part of the blade to

00:05:49.199 --> 00:06:09.180 
use the appropriate part of the blade to
do<00:05:49.319> so
