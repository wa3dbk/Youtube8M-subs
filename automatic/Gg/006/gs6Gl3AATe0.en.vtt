as<00:00:01.340> you<00:00:02.340> can<00:00:02.550> see<00:00:03.980> I'm<00:00:04.980> using<00:00:05.040> Sheila<00:00:05.850> for

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
as you can see I'm using Sheila for

harmonic points he creates frequency

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
harmonic points he creates frequency
this<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> AC<00:01:06.270> DC<00:01:07.080> current<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:09.049> no

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this is the AC DC current and no

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.770 
this is the AC DC current and no
oscillator<00:01:10.970> there<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> no<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:12.479> shred

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

conclusion<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.720> geometrical<00:01:24.720> positions

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
conclusion is that geometrical positions

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.780 
conclusion is that geometrical positions
are<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:26.310> important<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:28.020> horizon<00:01:28.790> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
are very important in the horizon you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.700 
are very important in the horizon you
must<00:01:30.079> have<00:01:31.079> geometrical<00:01:32.360> positions

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
must have geometrical positions

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.660 
must have geometrical positions

welder simple DC current phone from arc
welder<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.509> then<00:01:49.220> using<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.579> advisor

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
welder and then using the advisor

welder and then using the advisor
geometrically<00:01:53.250> derisory<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:54.439> with<00:01:55.439> the

right with geometrical horizon you put

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
right with geometrical horizon you put
