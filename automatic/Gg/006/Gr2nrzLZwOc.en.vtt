00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
notes that I'm only talking about the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.849

secondary markets in Hong Kong if you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
secondary markets in Hong Kong if you
bought<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.910> directly<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.750> Hot<00:00:24.930> Toys

bought these directly from Hot Toys

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
bought these directly from Hot Toys
you'd<00:00:25.920> easily<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.760> under<00:00:27.029> 200<00:00:27.480> pounds

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you'd easily get them under 200 pounds

you'd easily get them under 200 pounds
which<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.010> $300<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:30.510> point<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.199> not

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
which is $300 the point is that I'm not

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500 
which is $300 the point is that I'm not
talking<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.800> prices<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.369> eBay<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
talking about prices on eBay or in the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900 
talking about prices on eBay or in the
US<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.500> UK<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.130> even<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.730> other

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.190 
US or in the UK or even in other

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
territories because they can fluctuate

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
territories because they can fluctuate
wildly<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.059> only<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> talk<00:00:39.570> about

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
wildly so I'm only going to talk about

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.130 
wildly so I'm only going to talk about
the<00:00:40.260> cost<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.370> figures<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.910> stores<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the cost of these figures in stores and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
the cost of these figures in stores and
resellers<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.860> Hong<00:00:44.309> Kong<00:00:44.390> now<00:00:45.390> most<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> them

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
resellers in Hong Kong now most of them

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.180 
resellers in Hong Kong now most of them
I<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.079> you'll<00:00:46.320> recognize<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> they're

aware<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> works<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.850> I've<00:00:54.270> explained<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
aware how it works now I've explained it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.400 
aware how it works now I've explained it
in<00:00:55.079> previous<00:00:55.730> in<00:00:56.809> previous<00:00:57.809> videos<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.140> I've

in previous in previous videos that I've
done<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.829> really<00:01:00.020> importantly<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> fact

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
done and really importantly is the fact

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
done and really importantly is the fact
that<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.600> simple<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.899> clicking<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that it's not as simple as clicking a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.830 
that it's not as simple as clicking a

few buttons on sideshows website you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.670 
few buttons on sideshows website you
have<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> physically<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.460> these

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
have to physically go and get these

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
have to physically go and get these
pre-orders<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> person<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> queue<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.540> etc

holographic ones as well there are a few
floating<00:01:32.790> around<00:01:32.880> there's<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> handful<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
floating around there's a handful of

floating around there's a handful of
these<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> world<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.880> believe

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
these in the world so I don't believe

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020 
these in the world so I don't believe
these<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.450> exactly<00:01:37.310> easy<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.700> hold<00:01:38.880> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
these are exactly easy to get hold of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
these are exactly easy to get hold of
and<00:01:39.240> finally<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> exclude

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and finally I'm going to exclude

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
and finally I'm going to exclude
anything<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.030> released<00:01:42.689> yet<00:01:42.990> one

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
anything which is not released yet one

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
anything which is not released yet one
of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> big<00:01:44.009> ones<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.520> everyone's<00:01:44.790> talking

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
of the big ones that everyone's talking

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.389 
of the big ones that everyone's talking
about<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.659> stealth<00:01:46.110> mark<00:01:46.680> 7<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
about is this stealth mark 7 which I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429 
about is this stealth mark 7 which I
think<00:01:47.610> looks<00:01:47.790> amazing<00:01:48.200> hopefully<00:01:49.200> fingers

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
think looks amazing hopefully fingers

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.899 
think looks amazing hopefully fingers
crossed<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.280> hold<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> for

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
crossed I can get hold of this for

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
crossed I can get hold of this for
myself<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.570> I'd<00:01:51.840> love<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.649> my

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
myself because I'd love to have it in my

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
myself because I'd love to have it in my
collection<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> can

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
collection but I'm not sure if I can

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.179 
collection but I'm not sure if I can
because<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> looks<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
because it looks like it's going to be a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
because it looks like it's going to be a
lottery<00:01:57.119> again<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.719> Hong<00:01:57.899> Kong<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.740> may<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
lottery again in Hong Kong and it may be

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
lottery again in Hong Kong and it may be
a<00:01:59.130> movie<00:01:59.520> promo<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.299> we'll<00:02:00.479> see<00:02:00.630> how<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.899> gets

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
a movie promo so we'll see how that gets

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.859 
a movie promo so we'll see how that gets
on<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.680> let's<00:02:01.860> start<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.250> number<00:02:02.520> 10<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
on so let's start with number 10 this is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
on so let's start with number 10 this is
actually<00:02:04.079> gonna<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.350> group<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.040> around

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually gonna be a group because around

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.119 
actually gonna be a group because around
this<00:02:05.939> ballpark<00:02:06.180> figure<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:07.229> 3,000

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
this ballpark figure of around 3,000

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.330 
this ballpark figure of around 3,000
Hong<00:02:08.310> Kong<00:02:08.550> dollars<00:02:09.030> around<00:02:09.690> 260<00:02:10.349> pounds

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
Hong Kong dollars around 260 pounds

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.610 
Hong Kong dollars around 260 pounds
390<00:02:12.340> us<00:02:12.819> there's<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.959> hot<00:02:14.170> rod

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
390 us there's the hot rod

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.559 
390 us there's the hot rod
there's<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.190> peacemaker<00:02:15.760> which<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.360> very

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
there's the peacemaker which is very

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.509 
there's the peacemaker which is very
surprising<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:17.440> Hong<00:02:17.709> Kong<00:02:17.739> because<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.459> an

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
surprising in Hong Kong because it's an

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.290 
surprising in Hong Kong because it's an
exclusive<00:02:18.760> again<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.890> also<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.519> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
exclusive again and also we have the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.320 
exclusive again and also we have the
Python<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.760> these<00:02:24.849> are<00:02:24.910> kind<00:02:25.239> of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
Python so all of these are kind of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.240 
Python so all of these are kind of
grouped<00:02:25.540> together<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.230> price<00:02:26.500> range<00:02:26.680> if

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
grouped together in that price range if

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.009 
grouped together in that price range if
you<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:27.940> these<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.810> more

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
you have one of these is one of the more

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.530 
you have one of these is one of the more
exclusive<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.280> would<00:02:30.489> say<00:02:30.670> more<00:02:30.880> expensive

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
exclusive I would say more expensive

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.770 
exclusive I would say more expensive
ones<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:31.959> well<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:33.519> there<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:34.510> some<00:02:34.630> nice

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
ones as well so there are some nice

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.320 
ones as well so there are some nice
shots<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.230> those<00:02:35.410> fingers<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:35.890> those<00:02:35.980> poses

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
shots of those fingers and those poses

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.960 
shots of those fingers and those poses
number<00:02:37.330> nine<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.040> couple<00:02:39.459> here<00:02:39.640> again

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
number nine we have a couple here again

have this figure I'm not a big fan of

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.190 
have this figure I'm not a big fan of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
the mark 1 2.0 but this is the one to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.140 
the mark 1 2.0 but this is the one to

one to get so people are taking the
