I'm going to say that both games will be
huge<00:06:15.330> improvements<00:06:16.110> upon<00:06:16.260> their

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
predecessors both conceptually and an

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.010 
predecessors both conceptually and an
execution<00:06:20.430> of<00:06:20.490> things<00:06:20.760> that<00:06:21.000> longtime<00:06:21.270> fans

execution of things that longtime fans

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.320 
execution of things that longtime fans
