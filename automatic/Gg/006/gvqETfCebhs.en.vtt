okay<00:00:00.840> it's<00:00:01.020> late<00:00:01.170> June<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:01.800> here<00:00:02.070> at

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
okay it's late June and we're here at

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.800 
okay it's late June and we're here at
the<00:00:02.220> pumpkin<00:00:02.580> patch<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:03.090> I'm<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.629> do<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
the pumpkin patch and I'm going to do a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.690 
the pumpkin patch and I'm going to do a
short<00:00:04.110> demonstration<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.950> vine<00:00:05.220> burying

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
short demonstration on vine burying

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
short demonstration on vine burying
there<00:00:06.629> are<00:00:06.720> two<00:00:06.839> main<00:00:07.020> reasons<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.589> bury<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
there are two main reasons to bury the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.850 
there are two main reasons to bury the
vines<00:00:08.160> one<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.420> anchors<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.290> vine<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
vines one is it anchors the vine and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
vines one is it anchors the vine and
gives<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> plant<00:00:11.340> more<00:00:11.490> stability<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.420> keep

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
gives the plant more stability to keep

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.780 
gives the plant more stability to keep
the<00:00:12.870> leaves<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.799> rolling<00:00:14.190> over<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> wind

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the leaves from rolling over in the wind

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.359 
the leaves from rolling over in the wind
and<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.780> other<00:00:15.900> reason<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.590> increase<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and the other reason is to increase the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.980 
and the other reason is to increase the
root<00:00:17.550> system<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.119> look<00:00:18.330> closely<00:00:18.600> on

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
root system and if you look closely on

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.679 
root system and if you look closely on
the<00:00:19.740> top<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> vine<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.760> there's<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the top of the vine here there's a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.230 
the top of the vine here there's a
little<00:00:21.900> white<00:00:22.199> spot<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.060> little

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little white spot and that's a little

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
little white spot and that's a little
node<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.720> will<00:00:24.840> develop<00:00:25.140> into<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> root<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.039> we

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
node that will develop into a root if we

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
node that will develop into a root if we
cover<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.060> dirt<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
cover that with dirt so I'm going to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
cover that with dirt so I'm going to
show<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> process<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> first

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
show you the process here the first

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.500 
show you the process here the first
thing<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.710> need<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.790> trim<00:00:33.329> off

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
thing that we need to do is to trim off

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.040 
thing that we need to do is to trim off
this<00:00:33.899> tertiary<00:00:34.200> vine<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.660> keep<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this tertiary vine so that we keep the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010 
this tertiary vine so that we keep the
order<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> plant<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> leave

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
order of the plant and I like to leave

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.360 
order of the plant and I like to leave
one<00:00:40.920> leaf<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:42.930> vine<00:00:43.140> growing<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
one leaf on that vine growing just in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.709 
one leaf on that vine growing just in
case<00:00:44.550> something<00:00:44.820> happens<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.539> original

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
case something happens to my original

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
case something happens to my original
leaf<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.010> suffer<00:00:47.340> damage<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
leaf a lot of them suffer damage in the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.340 
leaf a lot of them suffer damage in the
wind<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> leaf<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wind and that way I have a leaf that can

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
wind and that way I have a leaf that can
replace<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> trim<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> rest

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
replace it so I'm going to trim the rest

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.020 
replace it so I'm going to trim the rest
of<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.420> vine<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> next<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.879> like

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
of that vine off the next thing I like

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
of that vine off the next thing I like
to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> take<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> pinch<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:56.149> mycorrhizal

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to do is take a pinch of mycorrhizal

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.590 
to do is take a pinch of mycorrhizal
fungi<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.520> fertilizer<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.270> apply

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
fungi and a little fertilizer and apply

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
fungi and a little fertilizer and apply
it<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.840> over<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.219> intersection<00:01:02.219> where

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it right over that intersection where

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
it right over that intersection where
the<00:01:03.390> root<00:01:03.600> will<00:01:03.780> form<00:01:04.549> then<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> reason<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> got

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the root will form then the reason I got

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
the root will form then the reason I got
the<00:01:06.270> gloves<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.869> gets<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.530> messy<00:01:07.890> we

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the gloves on is gets a little messy we

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
the gloves on is gets a little messy we
take<00:01:08.189> our<00:01:08.369> blood<00:01:09.240> paddy<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.290> we'll<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
take our blood paddy here and we'll just

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
take our blood paddy here and we'll just
place<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.850> over<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.530> lip<00:01:14.340> zone<00:01:15.650> form<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
place that over the lip zone form it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
place that over the lip zone form it
down<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.400> packet<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:20.689> time<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.869> do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
down a little packet and time will do

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.399 
down a little packet and time will do
the<00:01:22.049> rest

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the rest

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.840 
the rest
in<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.799> couple<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> weeks<00:01:23.310> we'll<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> nice

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
in a couple of weeks we'll have a nice

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
in a couple of weeks we'll have a nice
rip<00:01:24.150> coming<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> top<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> vine<00:01:25.350> go

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
rip coming off the top of the vine go

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.200 
rip coming off the top of the vine go
into<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> ground<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> we'll<00:01:26.759> double<00:01:27.000> our

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
into the ground and we'll double our

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
into the ground and we'll double our
root<00:01:27.390> system<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> plant<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:29.070> one

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
root system for the plant there's one

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
root system for the plant there's one
alternative<00:01:30.150> method<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> mud<00:01:31.950> paddy

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
alternative method to the mud paddy

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.030 
alternative method to the mud paddy
method<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.689> I'll<00:01:33.869> alternate<00:01:34.619> method<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
method and I'll alternate method to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
method and I'll alternate method to
burying<00:01:35.369> vines<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.060> dig<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> trench<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
burying vines is to dig a trench as I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.890 
burying vines is to dig a trench as I
have<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.610> simply<00:01:39.030> lay<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> vine<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
have here and simply lay the vine in the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
have here and simply lay the vine in the
trench<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.340> push<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> dirt<00:01:41.970> over<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
trench and then push the dirt over the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.010 
trench and then push the dirt over the
vine<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.159> personally<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.430> use<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.600> method

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
vine I personally don't use this method

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.130 
vine I personally don't use this method
and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> reason<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:47.549> soil<00:01:47.790> holds<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and the reason is my soil holds a lot of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.569 
and the reason is my soil holds a lot of
water<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.619> late<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> season

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
water and late in the season

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
water and late in the season
this<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.909> cause<00:01:51.119> rotting<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> vine<00:01:52.100> with

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this can cause rotting on the vine with

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
this can cause rotting on the vine with
the<00:01:53.310> original<00:01:53.759> method<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.210> bounding<00:01:54.869> around

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the original method of bounding around

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.230 
the original method of bounding around
each<00:01:55.350> leaf<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.610> course<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> season

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
each leaf over the course of the season

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.569 
each leaf over the course of the season
water<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:58.079> wash<00:01:58.259> away<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.619> dirt<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
water will wash away the dirt and that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.840 
water will wash away the dirt and that
way<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.210> will<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.780> air<00:02:01.850> traveling

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
way there will be more air traveling

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.170 
way there will be more air traveling
across<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> vine<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.689> preventing<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> rot

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
across the vine and preventing the rot

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.700 
across the vine and preventing the rot
okay<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.450> week<00:02:06.689> after<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> bury<00:02:07.469> your

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
okay about a week after you bury your

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.240 
okay about a week after you bury your
vines

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
vines

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.180 
vines
you'll<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.300> roots<00:02:09.569> growing<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.950> one

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you'll get roots growing like this one

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.760 
you'll get roots growing like this one
here<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.959> few<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.110> days<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
here a few more days this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
here a few more days this
go<00:02:13.920> down<00:02:14.130> into<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> ground<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.090> anchor<00:02:15.960> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
go down into the ground and anchor the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
go down into the ground and anchor the
vine<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.770> provide<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> lot<00:02:17.340> more<00:02:17.520> nutrients<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
vine and provide a lot more nutrients to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.960 
vine and provide a lot more nutrients to
the<00:02:18.120> plant<00:02:19.340> all<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.460> here<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the plant all right here we have a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.530 
the plant all right here we have a
secondary<00:02:21.510> vine<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:23.120> growing<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
secondary vine and growing off of that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.750 
secondary vine and growing off of that
secondary<00:02:24.930> vine<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> tertiary<00:02:25.650> by<00:02:26.130> tertiary

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
secondary vine is a tertiary by tertiary

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
secondary vine is a tertiary by tertiary
vines<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.300> no<00:02:27.480> no<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:27.930> want<00:02:28.050> tertiary

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
vines or no no we don't want tertiary

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.650 
vines or no no we don't want tertiary
vines<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> patch<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.940> simply<00:02:30.330> create<00:02:30.630> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
vines in the patch they simply create a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.540 
vines in the patch they simply create a
lot<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.930> confusion<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.560> take<00:02:31.920> energy<00:02:32.100> away

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
lot of confusion and take energy away

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.580 
lot of confusion and take energy away
from<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.820> pumpkins<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:34.140> want<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.410> trim

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
from the pumpkins so we want to trim

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380 
from the pumpkins so we want to trim
these<00:02:34.710> off<00:02:34.890> when<00:02:35.160> they're<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.550> young<00:02:35.820> like

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
these off when they're pretty young like

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.960 
these off when they're pretty young like
so<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.770> now<00:02:37.980> all<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> energy<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.760> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
so and that way now all the energy is is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.110 
so and that way now all the energy is is
goes<00:02:39.480> into<00:02:39.750> growing<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.080> secondary<00:02:40.950> vines<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
goes into growing the secondary vines to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.330 
goes into growing the secondary vines to
their<00:02:42.300> full<00:02:42.570> extent<00:02:43.010> all<00:02:44.010> right<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.250> I'm

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
their full extent all right now I'm

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.310 
their full extent all right now I'm
going<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.520> talk<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.970> about<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.570> flowers

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
going to talk to you about the flowers

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.570 
going to talk to you about the flowers
on<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> plant<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.280> know<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.550> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
on the plant so that you know how to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.280 
on the plant so that you know how to
distinguish<00:02:48.150> between<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.570> male<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.810> female

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
distinguish between a male and female

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.520 
distinguish between a male and female
flower<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.360> understand<00:02:51.530> pollinating

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
flower and understand pollinating

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
flower and understand pollinating
flowers<00:02:52.560> what<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.000> my<00:02:54.090> hand<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.570> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
flowers what I have here in my hand is a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.450 
flowers what I have here in my hand is a
male<00:02:54.900> flower<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.710> way<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.860> distinguish

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
male flower and the way you distinguish

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.300 
male flower and the way you distinguish
a<00:02:56.700> male<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.270> female<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.990> male<00:02:58.620> has<00:02:58.950> no

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
a male from a female is the male has no

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.790 
a male from a female is the male has no
pumpkin<00:02:59.790> underneath<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.330> whereas<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.470> female

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
pumpkin underneath it whereas the female

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800 
pumpkin underneath it whereas the female
flower<00:03:02.070> already<00:03:02.640> has<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.180> small<00:03:03.510> pumpkin

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
flower already has a small pumpkin

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.580 
flower already has a small pumpkin
underneath<00:03:04.260> it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
underneath it

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.950 
underneath it
now<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.330> things<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.660> need<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.840> know

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
now one of the things you need to know

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.410 
now one of the things you need to know
is<00:03:07.350> what<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> flower<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.850> open<00:03:09.180> so

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
is what a flower is going to open so

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.930 
is what a flower is going to open so
that<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.900> time<00:03:10.110> your<00:03:10.260> pollinating<00:03:10.800> and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that you can time your pollinating and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.100 
that you can time your pollinating and
the<00:03:11.940> way<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> tell<00:03:12.420> when<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> flower<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.990> going

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the way you tell when a flower is going

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.100 
the way you tell when a flower is going
to<00:03:13.290> open<00:03:14.210> first<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.450> all<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> becomes<00:03:15.930> much

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
to open first of all it becomes much

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.580 
to open first of all it becomes much
larger<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:18.000> takes<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.450> slightly<00:03:19.350> orange

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
larger and it takes a slightly orange

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.400 
larger and it takes a slightly orange
yellow<00:03:20.340> orange<00:03:20.730> color<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.450> tip<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.870> it's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
yellow orange color on the tip and it's

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.020 
yellow orange color on the tip and it's
also<00:03:22.560> much<00:03:22.860> softer<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.550> were<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.760> squeeze

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
also much softer if you were to squeeze

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.840 
also much softer if you were to squeeze
this<00:03:24.300> it's<00:03:24.930> very<00:03:25.050> soft<00:03:25.740> this<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.220> rather<00:03:26.459> firm

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
this it's very soft this is rather firm

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.790 
this it's very soft this is rather firm
so<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> flower<00:03:28.110> that's<00:03:28.380> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.740> open

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
so this is a flower that's going to open

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.400 
so this is a flower that's going to open
or<00:03:29.400> would<00:03:29.580> have<00:03:29.700> opened<00:03:29.820> tomorrow<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
or would have opened tomorrow this is a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.650 
or would have opened tomorrow this is a
male<00:03:31.620> flower<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.970> order<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.240> pollinate

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
male flower and in order to pollinate

the entire view of the plant here and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.120 
the entire view of the plant here and
I'm<00:04:30.630> standing<00:04:30.960> down<00:04:31.380> at<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.620> end<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:31.950> main

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
I'm standing down at the end of the main

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.310 
I'm standing down at the end of the main
vine<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.060> main<00:04:33.210> vine<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.540> running<00:04:33.870> towards

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
vine so the main vine is running towards

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.070 
vine so the main vine is running towards
me<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.890> base<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.370> plant<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.880> at<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
me the base of the plant is at the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.980 
me the base of the plant is at the
camera<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:38.180> which<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.750> called<00:04:39.930> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
camera and which this is called a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.840 
camera and which this is called a
Christmas<00:04:40.200> tree<00:04:40.530> pattern<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.460> main<00:04:41.640> vine

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
Christmas tree pattern the main vine

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.430 
Christmas tree pattern the main vine
runs<00:04:42.150> towards<00:04:42.450> me<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.780> all<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> secondary

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
runs towards me and all the secondary

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.100 
runs towards me and all the secondary
vines<00:04:43.770> run<00:04:44.430> off<00:04:44.610> at<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.880> 90<00:04:45.210> degree<00:04:45.510> angle<00:04:45.540> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
vines run off at a 90 degree angle to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.800 
vines run off at a 90 degree angle to
the<00:04:46.140> main<00:04:46.380> vine<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.920> as<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:47.970> can<00:04:48.120> see<00:04:48.330> it's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
the main vine and as you can see it's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.570 
the main vine and as you can see it's
wider<00:04:49.140> at<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.410> base<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.890> plant<00:04:50.130> narrow<00:04:50.430> at

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
wider at the base of the plant narrow at

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580 
wider at the base of the plant narrow at
the<00:04:50.610> top<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> resembles<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.990> Christmas<00:04:52.380> tree

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the top so it resembles a Christmas tree

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.040 
the top so it resembles a Christmas tree
if<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.800> fell<00:04:53.040> down<00:04:53.250> on<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.430> ground<00:04:54.050> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
if it fell down on the ground the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.570 
if it fell down on the ground the
importance<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.620> vine<00:04:55.800> training<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.460> the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
importance of vine training is so the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.460 
importance of vine training is so the
plant<00:04:56.820> doesn't<00:04:57.210> get<00:04:57.390> disorganized<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.290> easy

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
plant doesn't get disorganized it's easy

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.060 
plant doesn't get disorganized it's easy
to<00:04:58.620> work<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.780> what<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.920> take

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
to work in and what I like to do is take

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.610 
to work in and what I like to do is take
stakes<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.700> guide<00:05:02.910> my<00:05:03.150> vines<00:05:03.450> I'll<00:05:03.840> simply

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
stakes to guide my vines I'll simply

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.410 
stakes to guide my vines I'll simply
push<00:05:04.800> them<00:05:04.950> in<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.100> ground<00:05:05.310> just<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.090> front<00:05:06.360> of

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
push them in the ground just in front of

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.570 
push them in the ground just in front of
a<00:05:06.510> leaf<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:07.500> this<00:05:07.590> will<00:05:07.830> help<00:05:07.980> train<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.400> vine

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
a leaf and this will help train the vine

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.900 
a leaf and this will help train the vine
in<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.820> direction<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.330> want<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.750> go
