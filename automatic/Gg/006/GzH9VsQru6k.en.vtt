00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
he doesn't have terrible mouth but

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
he doesn't have terrible mouth but
that's<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.990> you'll<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that's how you look and you'll see a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.770 
that's how you look and you'll see a
black<00:01:22.679> dot<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> moves<00:01:23.369> away<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.780> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
black dot that moves away and you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
black dot that moves away and you
probably<00:01:25.110> didn't<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.860> camera

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
probably didn't see that on the camera

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably didn't see that on the camera
but<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> saw<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> anyway<00:01:29.670> there's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
but I saw it so anyway there's not a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
but I saw it so anyway there's not a
whole<00:01:30.270> bunch<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.810> shouldn't<00:01:31.140> cause<00:01:31.469> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
whole bunch of them shouldn't cause that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.080 
whole bunch of them shouldn't cause that
much<00:01:32.009> scabbing<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> face<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.880> see

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
much scabbing on the face so you can see

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
much scabbing on the face so you can see
he's<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.539> lot<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.750> scouting<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.469> face

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
he's got a lot of scouting on the face

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.969 
he's got a lot of scouting on the face
so<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.219> did<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.360> course<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.679> cat

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so what I did is of course when the cat

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
so what I did is of course when the cat
has<00:01:42.860> itchy<00:01:43.860> ears<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.819> itchy<00:01:44.939> face<00:01:45.330> we<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:46.470> in

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
has itchy ears and itchy face we look in

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
has itchy ears and itchy face we look in
their<00:01:46.799> ears<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.429> if<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.819> black

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
their ears and see if we can get black

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.270 
their ears and see if we can get black
wax<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.630> wax<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.140> exit<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.039> mites

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
wax it wax the exit a like your mites

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.389 
wax it wax the exit a like your mites
and<00:01:51.319> there's<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> actuate

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and there's a little bit of actuate

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.740 
and there's a little bit of actuate
there<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:55.729> could<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.509> ear

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
there and could be that there's some ear

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.370 
there and could be that there's some ear
mites<00:01:57.989> and<00:01:58.259> add<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:59.599> that<00:02:00.599> wax<00:02:00.929> so<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> can

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
mites and add in that wax so you can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
mites and add in that wax so you can
look<00:02:01.470> at<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.739> under<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.099> microscope<00:02:02.220> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
look at that under the microscope in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.340 
look at that under the microscope in
this<00:02:04.049> case<00:02:05.270> what<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> did<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.959> took<00:02:06.989> away<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.599 

this<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.470> something<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.799> can't<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.340> home

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
this is something you can't do at home

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.920 
this is something you can't do at home
but<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:16.019> can<00:02:16.049> also<00:02:16.819> sup<00:02:17.819> for<00:02:18.090> y'all<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.510> know

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.930 

then<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.959> put<00:02:22.440> some<00:02:22.470> mineral<00:02:23.100> oil<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.549> slide

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
then I put some mineral oil on a slide

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.150 
then I put some mineral oil on a slide
and<00:02:25.609> that's<00:02:26.609> just<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.000> kippah

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
and that's just a kippah

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.080 
and that's just a kippah
