00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.169
 hello everyone except that moment 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.169
 today we look at this process 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:24.689
 n 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.640
 Yes, we continue to consider fashion and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.489
 today we look at about which adds 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.239
 he 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.339
 unique such a thing we can 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.609
 build on the walls 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.560
 and only for the reason 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.000
 at 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.760
 but after shooting we need this 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.940
 this is not counted this is not 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.550
 plowed for the first quarter 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 did not understand what they do and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 the match will be already written 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 that's just what you need to get used to 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.490
 my deactivates ie we 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.970
 can't do anything can't 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.270
 canvas as activate 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 and we can nest threads along the walls 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.070
 then we cling head and this 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 piece all these three let go of cues just 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 we can from opposition 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.030
 problem 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.350
 very useful thing is this will pour out 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.660
 car for so many bugs 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.160
 but often 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 Romantic gardener set 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.390
 as stressed that we are such smart systems 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 single window free 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.080
 n and how it is so the remains of someone here 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.550
 masses 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.580
 the so-called parker of course 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 let's take 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.430
 Kirkuk 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is clear to everyone 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.230
 but a lot is not there, just because not 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.930
 will receive 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.460
 here we need 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.869
 ohh rzhd about some sort of bomb potsdam this 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.860
 mean just before snapping the moment 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.830
 systems clean it up clearly 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.910
 no mood yet 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 so ok now 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 need to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 so let's try again 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.750
 project desire dps problems forgot 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.419
 the site stuck 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.419
 and dig 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:19.879
 which of course is not very fast but 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.919
 digging and that's what the boy fell out 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.339
 and you can count the dead man the reverse 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.429
 project our way 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.820
 35 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.070
 but it must be considered to unhook from 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.770
 this system but that's probably all because 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.560
 that this year still it didnâ€™t mean helmet I 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.189
 tried skirmishes ottellini 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.609
 do not give quickly as a poet and such 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.840
 gave the day before in everything 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.269
 so what and with whom what is about to subscribe to 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.860
 a channel with such comments 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.689
 quite so
