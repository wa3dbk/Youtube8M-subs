 occasion we are going to release this album of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.100
 stickers will have gone ball evolution wine 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.740
 from the hand of panini 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.299
 and basically we have stickers of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 the super cool movie they made in 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.850
 dragon ball 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.700
 we would start 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.890
 here will go a ball evolution and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.890
 we will save some cards in a type 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.070
 so lentito and others as normal 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.399
 basically it's that there is no more no one is 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.800
 presenting the characters we have something 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.670
 q 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.670
 burman 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.690
 piccolo is wrong 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.610
 and then dragonball evolution and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.110
 basically he is explaining to us in 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.690
 images and some text in what 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.910
 It happens in the film here after 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.490
 train hard with your grandpa with assist 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.640
 to the Institute 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.950
 in this when the institute is going to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.800
 see is a movie that disappointed me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.420
 very much at the time of war you go with 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 an idea and you find everything 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.410
 contrary to see, I think I respect all 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.510
 the opinions there may be people who 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.099
 It's worth it if you go with the idea that we 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.290
 dragonball dices is good but yes 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.440
 we go with this idea I the truth is that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440
 do not 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.519
 coming back I like it 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.519
 here we have here 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.340
 and good if you have seen it because they will sound 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.879
 a lot does not cause 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.020
 the start of the movie phone arrives 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:56.500
 to a party and sway with him 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.960
 the typical of these American movies 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.380
 I do not know what budget they have 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.420
 for example sx1 super special effects 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760
 what I did is where they stayed in this 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.550
 movie I no longer have to respect them 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.170
 the person that likes me I respect him 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.750
 I'm giving you my personal opinion 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.380
 yes I am not in very respectful but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.610
 I see a peak so you can 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.610
 it's like it's not worth it 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.880
 and good if you do not like it 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.780
 because you bought the album 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.170
 well basically basically some time ago 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.920
 the jaguar from time to time in the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.500
 stores like bazaars and Chinese in the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.670
 mister in which includes the album with 50 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 envelopes worth of all types of collections 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.519
 what can you imagine 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:58.220
 then I saw four euros and 150 vii 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.620
 envelopes then it is not bad and then 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.840
 that's why I bought it and then I was hitting 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.870
 entertaining - and good here is the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.870
 result 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.960
 here we have a motorboat 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.140
 our heroes fall into the trap of the 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.140
 nhtsa 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.220
 here we have the bad guys 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.370
 well that was stallone movie and never 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.370
 plus 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.540
 time ran out before it produced 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.990
 the eclipse of the moon in its environment not 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.510
 I know where they got that Peruvian 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.510
 the snipers of tulum 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.070
 and well this represents a tournament of 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.860
 martial arts so very modern in the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:02.860
 that fight chichis and it's already here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 yes 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.100
 and since it's good, they have with the 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.190
 double basic and bright leads 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.020
 that I taught you there is not much mystery 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.330
 here we have the master roshi 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.849
 and you say good if it's bald, not like the 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.050
 but I think they have painted a 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.639
 bit 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.759
 I do not know, you go with the idea of ​​finding a 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.330
 Symbol similar to the character and it hits you 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.330
 very much 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.550
 we have the part that was never seen in 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.720
 dragon ball the one that censored us 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.720
 always with coconut 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.050
 same 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.110
 here 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.819
 in this fireball turns the 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.319
 hallway in ashes when a 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.319
 weapon to the extraterrestrial aspect 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.439
 so we have to piccolo looking for 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.439
 cutting of a target the destruction 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.350
 and here he has already removed his super suit 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.230
 preparing for the fight 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.650
 definitive a fight that is very much 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.650
 to wish 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.210
 I'm a bit of a joke, do not make me 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.210
 a lot of case 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.910
 we may like it and nothing happens 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.820
 this 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:57.569
 and a few brighter and two like that 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.569
 for the end of the album 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.990
 and dragonball evolution is already that's 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.360
 all 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.490
 It was good I hope you liked it 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.560
 here thrown on the floor because I'm 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.050
 loading the camera and I did not want to leave it 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.690
 no video today so everything I do 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.230
 missing for you a greeting and even the 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.230
 next video
