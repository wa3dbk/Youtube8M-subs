00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.330
 and good that they are very good in this 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.100
 I'm going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.930
 the kinds of microsd memory that 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.029
 we have so that we have a little bit more 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.800
 of information about it and good as well 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.810
 we can make a good purchase at 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.369
 moment to choose our micro sd or 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.140
 know that this also falls on the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.630
 optimal operation of our mobile 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.489
 very well I know that the best many do not 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.040
 you know and if you already know that good now 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.560
 that we all have different kinds of 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.899
 microsd memory we have the memory of 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.570
 class 2 of not two class 4 memories 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.090
 they will have class 6 memories and we have 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 a class memory of each class by 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.269
 supposedly more expensive than the previous one but 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.410
 not according to a transfer speed 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.760
 minimum in reading and writing yes good 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.920
 we have said speed for example 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.379
 we have the class 2 that assures us 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.750
 a minimum speed of 2 megabytes we have 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.840
 the class 4 that is not known minimum of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.490
 4 megabytes we have the class 6 not according to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.370
 a minimum transfer speed of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.870
 6 megas also that of the class 10 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.100
 which gives us according to the speed of 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.409
 10-meter minimum transfer 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 good but better class good with 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.850
 microsd card of the best class 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.060
 transfer speeds before between 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.810
 your sd / tu is on your phone but they will be 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.700
 much older 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 so everything that involves using the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.500
 micro sd on your phone marÃ­a ideal 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.880
 according to the speed 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.800
 good for all of us who have 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 phones of a low range as well 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.650
 say it for example as the ego 81-85 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.260
 other models like that of the galaxy e 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.360
 he did different he does not have enough 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.610
 of internal memory to install it that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.140
 they are applications so they know that 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.630
 we have to pass all the applications 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.640
 to the north close by if you can continue 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.130
 installing many more applications or 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.500
 we simply use the application as 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.270
 sling 2 of sd to be able to make a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.580
 virtual memory position in your 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.160
 phone but good how to know all this 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.440
 so that our microsd card but if 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.870
 we do not have a good microsd card 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.239
 class phone simply we will 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.010
 it is not going to get much more 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.320
 slow since the data transfer 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.150
 is increasing and with a sd card of 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.860
 low class if it's not our valentine 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.830
 phone until at least 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 let's change the note class sd card this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.760
 who know about class is your micro sd 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.410
 so look at the top of the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.110
 we have the same class 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 quantity in a semicircle as it is in 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.700
 my case for example here 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.680
 I have what is a micro sd class 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.050
 4 that focused on a micro sd class 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.050
 4 of 4 gb 80 and one 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.790
 very good is this card good for me 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.280
 I'm not doing very well and very badly 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.019
 but something regular to the chin since doing 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.410
 an operation is the same or the game is 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.620
 heavy 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.300
 so sometimes it is not entirely of light 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 but maybe from the kind of memory that 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.640
 we have used for that born 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.980
 frames of data and is the case of friends and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.140
 friends that for example I made a video 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.450
 how to make an appearance of the web 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.610
 and the case stays 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.569
 the swap program posters class them 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.999
 is engraved so to speak hung 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.969
 and good only rich in what can be in 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:27.609
 your microsd card 15 on the card 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.650
 microsd that you have and through 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.379
 that you see anybody is 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.840
 too important good finally the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.329
 accumulation of card and class you 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680
 you can buy good classes only 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.829
 safe at a transfer speed 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.439
 in minimal that is, it can go faster 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.139
 a sd card of class 2 of a 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.689
 good brand with a class 4 memory of 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.549
 a bad brand and if you spend a little 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.069
 but he 's sure that it's worth a lot 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.950
 It's a good pity to also say that 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.569
 recommended in fact what everyone 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.240
 they know they are not those of different kinds of 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.190
 classes and that is that they are the highest 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.280
 in order to enjoy much more 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.320
 of our cell phone because good up here 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.580
 this video so far this video I hope 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.020
 that this small one has served you 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.830
 information and the video has been a bit 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.620
 short but 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.630
 so the point what you guys 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.830
 understand what it refers to 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.420
 microsd memories 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.700
 I hope the server detail video 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.890
 I think that for now we stay here and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.360
 we will see in the next video is worth a 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.360
 like with you and chau chau
