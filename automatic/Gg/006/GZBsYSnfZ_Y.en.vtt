in general when I'm in my offseason I
would<00:00:35.000> say<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:35.540> train<00:00:36.050> whatever<00:00:36.380> I<00:00:36.559> feel

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
would say that I train whatever I feel

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.069 
would say that I train whatever I feel
like<00:00:36.890> training<00:00:37.309> felt<00:00:37.730> like<00:00:37.850> training<00:00:38.329> glutes

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
like training felt like training glutes

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.140

it<00:00:39.620> had<00:00:39.860> been<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.040> few<00:00:40.340> days<00:00:40.489> since<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.820> hadn't

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
it had been a few days since I hadn't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.119 
it had been a few days since I hadn't
trained<00:00:41.450> legs<00:00:41.690> or<00:00:41.989> anything<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:42.680> definitely

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
trained legs or anything so I definitely

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.920 
trained legs or anything so I definitely
wanted<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.520> push<00:00:43.940> those<00:00:44.180> extra<00:00:44.690> calories

wanted to push those extra calories

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.009 
wanted to push those extra calories
where<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:45.800> wanted<00:00:46.309> them<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.700> go<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.629> that's<00:00:47.900> why

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.710 

I<00:00:54.710> decided<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.040> start<00:00:56.310> competing<00:00:56.700> because<00:00:57.090> at

I decided to start competing because at

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.990 
I decided to start competing because at
the<00:00:57.870> time<00:00:58.080> Aaron<00:00:58.830> Stern<00:00:59.130> was<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> my

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the time Aaron Stern was one of my

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
the time Aaron Stern was one of my
biggest<00:01:00.210> inspirations<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.260> she's<00:01:01.740> basically

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
biggest inspirations and she's basically

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
biggest inspirations and she's basically
the<00:01:02.280> reason<00:01:02.550> why<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> wanted<00:01:03.450> to<00:01:03.510> step<00:01:03.780> onstage

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.280 
the reason why I wanted to step onstage
I<00:01:04.590> moved<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> Vancouver<00:01:05.160> in<00:01:05.820> 2012<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I moved to Vancouver in 2012 and I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.680 
I moved to Vancouver in 2012 and I
decided<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.800> compete<00:01:08.010> eight<00:01:08.850> weeks<00:01:09.150> after<00:01:09.660> I

decided to compete eight weeks after I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.240 
decided to compete eight weeks after I
moved<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.470> guess<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> could<00:01:10.920> say<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.190> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
moved I guess you could say it was a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
moved I guess you could say it was a
learning<00:01:11.460> experience<00:01:11.760> more<00:01:12.330> than<00:01:12.600> anything<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
learning experience more than anything I

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
learning experience more than anything I
loved<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.370> hooked<00:01:14.640> after<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> first

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
loved it I was hooked after the first
show<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.290> wanted<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:16.980> a<00:01:17.250> year

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
show and I wanted to come back a year

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700 
show and I wanted to come back a year
after<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> same<00:01:18.780> competition<00:01:19.230> and<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
after to that same competition and I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.650 
after to that same competition and I
trained<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.280> butt<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> year<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
trained my butt off for a year more and

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.380 
trained my butt off for a year more and
I<00:01:22.290> won<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.370> my<00:01:23.550> class<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:24.270> next

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I won first place in my class the next

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:44.890 
I won first place in my class the next
year

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.500 

typically<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.860> week<00:01:46.070> I'll<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.610> two<00:01:47.000> leg<00:01:47.270> days

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
typically in a week I'll do two leg days

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.570 
typically in a week I'll do two leg days
so<00:01:48.020> one<00:01:48.260> of<00:01:48.290> my<00:01:48.470> leg<00:01:48.650> days<00:01:48.860> will<00:01:49.070> be<00:01:49.190> heavier

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
so one of my leg days will be heavier

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.870 
so one of my leg days will be heavier
I'll<00:01:49.970> do<00:01:50.210> less<00:01:50.480> reps<00:01:50.870> heavier<00:01:51.680> weight<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
I'll do less reps heavier weight and the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.450 
I'll do less reps heavier weight and the
second<00:01:53.240> day<00:01:53.330> I'll<00:01:53.540> do<00:01:53.690> higher<00:01:53.960> rep<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.830> focus

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
second day I'll do higher rep so I focus

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.010 
second day I'll do higher rep so I focus
more<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.730> glutes<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.240> hamstrings<00:01:56.780> more

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
more on glutes and hamstrings more

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.410 
more on glutes and hamstrings more
lunges<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.010> more<00:01:58.580> body<00:01:58.790> weight<00:01:58.880> stuff<00:01:59.240> as
