00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello my name is for real and this is 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.069
 abstract field before anything else is left 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
 thank you very much because practically 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 a day ago he just opened the channel and now 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 I have more than 100 subscribers and in the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 first video more than 1,000 videos 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.119
 he conveyed his comments seriously that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 I thank you very much in this video 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.330
 in fact it is also in response to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 several of the comments and it's about 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.220
 lighting and I always only have a little 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.349
 controversial is a bit difficult to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 handle the truth then today we are going to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 talk a little about what lighting is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 what it really is about that also 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.239
 I'm going to teach you how to make some like 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.910
 that a homemade semi-professional wax 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 some well-placed lights and how it changes is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 the color and this and the clarity of all 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.789
 we encourage you to use talking about 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.590
 lighting considers three things or that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.989
 there are three things that you always have to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.960
 be very careful whether the light is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 that you're using the first one is never 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 put a light source a focus one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.460
 lamp whatever 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 right in front of your face 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.710
 disappear deer dazzled true or 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 something like that and the truth is that it dazzles the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.440
 camera and it brings out a lot of shine on your face 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 and in natural tones the second one is 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.740
 try not to mix different types of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.770
 light so do not mix a focus 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.830
 incandescent with a halogen with 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 one and lidio is about not mixing that 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.229
 all the lighting you use is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.350
 uniform and finally always consider 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 your camera remembers that the quality that goes 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 to leave the video has a lot to do 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 with the camera that you are using then 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 always work with your camera see that it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 you see better that you do not look better there are things 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 that with your camera you're just not going to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.750
 to do but there are many that if 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 you can do this is considering and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.080
 during all segments and always 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.509
 We will be doing tests of 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 little camera that is this camera that I have 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.140
 here that is a camera of those types of 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.570
 portable hard drive then if they want 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 we go into more detail of this one but for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 use something that is available to everyone 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.550
 world that we see the differences and that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 not with a camera 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.570
 professional or semi-professional where 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 changes completely true whenever 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.500
 see something that is test with camarita 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.840
 it is with this then let's see 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.730
 the differences between the focus 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.380
 warm fluorescent and focus 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.380
 cold fluorescent 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.770
 I'm going to show you how to make a being of 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.620
 an illumination that you can use in 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.300
 house that is mobile that will serve you if 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 this are you doing blogs or are you 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.210
 doing make-up tutorials or 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.350
 Nail tutorials are crafts 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.370
 what is this is quite useful ok then 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.370
 there they are going 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.010
 Y 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.750
 and 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.329
 Y 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.780
 Y 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.120
 that's how the desk is here I'm going to put 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.700
 the camera as you can see here is the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.959
 stand more or less knows the distance of 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.130
 an arm 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.130
 I have a mirror there for 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.510
 but here is the light I put it in a 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.720
 little table retired more or less like a 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.220
 step of where the stand is is if the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.500
 I'm dizzy sorry I want them 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.860
 teach in anal life is simple light 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.860
 true 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.080
 and so it is made to see with that light on 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.740
 they just treat us badly but if there 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.330
 from the color of the skin I do not know very well 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.300
 this one that must be brick as well 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.850
 reddish field looks very well what I 'm going to 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.270
 to do is I'm going to pay that and I'm going to 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.930
 learn the miraculous lamp that 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.930
 we made for the cutter 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.350
 then then you can not see the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.770
 difference for example already the brick and 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.410
 make the red 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.790
 the color of my skin as it arrives but 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.390
 Yes now 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.610
 yes very well if I hold super well and then 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.390
 changes a lot then this kind of 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.700
 illumination 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.010
 the phrase of not mixing light is not necessary 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.640
 the one on top and lit the part 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.990
 below but turn off the top one 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.720
 understood what we did for 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.950
 that the whole light was quality and change 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.680
 the colors of you can see 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:02.590
 immediately do not see then this one goes 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.969
 for bloggers who do this and the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.860
 gurus 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.629
 Well, here I have some meetings for you 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.139

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.139
