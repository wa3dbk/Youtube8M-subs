the jewel rx buddy box system it's
available<00:00:10.019> from<00:00:10.380> hobbyking<00:00:10.860> I've<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
available from hobbyking I've got a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
available from hobbyking I've got a
feeling<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:11.670> probably<00:00:11.700> available<00:00:12.210> from

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
feeling it's probably available from

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.039 
feeling it's probably available from
other<00:00:13.230> suppliers<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.889> well<00:00:14.719> it's<00:00:15.719> probably

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
other suppliers as well it's probably

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.400 
other suppliers as well it's probably
better<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.260> use<00:00:16.470> them

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
better to use them

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.090 
better to use them

to<00:00:56.820> switch<00:00:57.180> between<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.739> fly

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to switch between the two so you can fly

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
to switch between the two so you can fly
on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> master<00:00:59.879> flick<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> switches

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
on the master flick one of the switches

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.780 
on the master flick one of the switches
on<00:01:01.739> your<00:01:02.629> receiver<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.400> switch

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on your receiver and it will then switch

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.859 
on your receiver and it will then switch
over<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> using<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> slave<00:01:07.280> nun<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.460> your

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
over to using the slave nun if your

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.060 
over to using the slave nun if your
throttle<00:01:09.869> aileron<00:01:10.409> rudder<00:01:10.770> elevator

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.359 
throttle aileron rudder elevator
anything<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.060> work<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> only<00:01:13.950> thing

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
anything will work and the only thing

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.120 
anything will work and the only thing
that<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.670> still<00:01:14.909> function<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.380> switch

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that will still function is the switch

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
that will still function is the switch
to<00:01:17.549> turn<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.360> master<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.140> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to turn it back to master so you just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
to turn it back to master so you just
flick<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> switch<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> you're

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
flick the switch back again and you're

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
flick the switch back again and you're
back<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> control<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.350> great<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
back in control and it's a great way of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
back in control and it's a great way of
letting<00:01:24.090> people<00:01:24.869> maybe<00:01:25.320> new<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> Hobby

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
letting people maybe new to the Hobby

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270 
letting people maybe new to the Hobby
that<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.979> fork

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that don't want to go out and and fork

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
that don't want to go out and and fork
out<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> plane<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> let<00:01:31.020> until<00:01:31.290> they've

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
out for a plane and let until they've

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
out for a plane and let until they've
tried<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.009> obviously<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.549> they're<00:01:32.759> new<00:01:32.939> to

the Hobby you don't want them to crash
in<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.500> plane<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> allows<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in your plane so it allows them to have

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
in your plane so it allows them to have
ever<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> practice<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.030> allows

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
ever go have a practice and it allows

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
ever go have a practice and it allows
you<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> keep<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:39.810> plane<00:01:40.079> safe<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.799> great

really<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.430> UBC<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.270> cracking<00:02:07.259> bit<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> kit<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
really a UBC is cracking bit a kit to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
really a UBC is cracking bit a kit to
have<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.940> you're<00:02:09.420> speaking<00:02:09.959> trollop

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
have because if you're speaking trollop

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.390 
have because if you're speaking trollop
burns<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.400> lose<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.239> UBC

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
burns out you lose the UBC

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.720 
burns out you lose the UBC
whereas<00:02:15.240> if<00:02:15.390> you've<00:02:15.540> got<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> separate<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
whereas if you've got a separate one it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
whereas if you've got a separate one it
will<00:02:17.820> still<00:02:18.030> keep<00:02:18.150> running<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.660> you'll<00:02:19.260> still

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
will still keep running and you'll still

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.050 
will still keep running and you'll still
be<00:02:19.620> able<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> glide<00:02:20.070> your<00:02:20.250> plane<00:02:20.460> back<00:02:20.700> down<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
be able to glide your plane back down to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.870 
be able to glide your plane back down to
the<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> ground<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.130> attempt<00:02:23.790> a
