okay<00:00:01.230> some<00:00:01.560> thoughts<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.220> Apple<00:00:02.520> watch

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay some thoughts about the Apple watch

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay some thoughts about the Apple watch
after<00:00:02.939> I've<00:00:03.179> been<00:00:03.300> using<00:00:03.510> it<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.020> while<00:00:04.200> I

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
after I've been using it for a while I

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.070 
after I've been using it for a while I
do<00:00:04.529> like<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.950> watch<00:00:05.339> i<00:00:05.730> do<00:00:05.790> like<00:00:06.450> certain

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
do like the watch i do like certain

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.169 
do like the watch i do like certain
aspects<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.040> some<00:00:08.069> aspects<00:00:08.820> i<00:00:08.970> think

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
aspects of it in some aspects i think

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.089 
aspects of it in some aspects i think
could<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.480> improved<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:10.500> example<00:00:10.830> i'd<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.070> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
could be improved for example i'd like a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.430 
could be improved for example i'd like a
setting<00:00:11.610> where<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.030> could<00:00:12.269> let<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.870> time<00:00:13.139> stay

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
setting where we could let the time stay

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.499 
setting where we could let the time stay
on<00:00:13.650> longer<00:00:13.950> when<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> turn<00:00:14.610> your<00:00:14.820> wrist<00:00:15.030> up<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
on longer when you turn your wrist up I

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
on longer when you turn your wrist up I
mean<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.020> should<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.260> able<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> control<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
mean you should be able to control that

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980 
mean you should be able to control that
battery<00:00:17.609> life<00:00:17.789> has<00:00:17.970> not<00:00:18.180> been<00:00:18.420> an<00:00:18.570> issue<00:00:18.690> I've

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
battery life has not been an issue I've

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420 
battery life has not been an issue I've
had<00:00:19.170> plenty<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> battery<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> end<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
had plenty of battery at the end of the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.099 
had plenty of battery at the end of the
day<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.850> wouldn't<00:00:21.180> mind<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.810> screen

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
day so I wouldn't mind that the screen

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.769 
day so I wouldn't mind that the screen
stayed<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.710> three<00:00:23.609> times<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.060> long<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> does

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
stayed on three times as long as it does

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
stayed on three times as long as it does
so<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.740> thing<00:00:26.240> phone<00:00:27.240> calls<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:28.140> use

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so that's one thing phone calls I do use

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
so that's one thing phone calls I do use
my<00:00:29.189> phone<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.820> phone<00:00:30.269> calls<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
my phone for phone calls and it is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.410 
my phone for phone calls and it is
aggravating<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.460> fish<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
aggravating to have to fish out the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
aggravating to have to fish out the
phone<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> phone<00:00:34.440> call<00:00:34.710> comes<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.190> just

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
phone when the phone call comes in just

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
phone when the phone call comes in just
to<00:00:35.550> find<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.450> phone<00:00:36.719> call<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to find out that it's a phone call you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
to find out that it's a phone call you
didn't<00:00:37.260> want<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> really

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
didn't want to take any way so I really

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
didn't want to take any way so I really
like<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> being<00:00:39.690> displayed<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> watch

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
like that being displayed on the watch

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
like that being displayed on the watch
and<00:00:40.980> being<00:00:41.190> able<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> grab<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> quick<00:00:42.000> phone

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to do as best I can without actual macro

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
to do as best I can without actual macro
lens<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:59.039> precision<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.329> way

the<00:01:00.629> band's<00:01:00.870> fit<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.680> easy<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the band's fit in and how easy it is to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
the band's fit in and how easy it is to
change<00:01:02.670> them<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:05.070> really

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
change them and I think they they really

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
change them and I think they they really
have<00:01:05.700> done<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> great<00:01:06.360> job<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> version<00:01:07.530> one

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have done a great job for a version one

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
have done a great job for a version one
watch<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.820> far<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> quality<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> fit<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
watch as far as the quality the fit and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080 
watch as far as the quality the fit and
finish<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.670> Swiss

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
finish and so on and I think Swiss

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.109 
finish and so on and I think Swiss
watches<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.960> threatened<00:01:13.920> by<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.119> Indian

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
watches are threatened by this Indian

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.179 
watches are threatened by this Indian
taco<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.509> macbreak<00:01:16.049> weekly<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.950> think

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
taco on macbreak weekly and I think

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
taco on macbreak weekly and I think
others<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.150> discussion<00:01:18.270> about

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
others had a little discussion about

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.710 
others had a little discussion about
that<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.939> disagree<00:01:20.939> without<00:01:21.210> their

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that and I disagree without their

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
that and I disagree without their
general<00:01:22.140> consensus<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
general consensus that this is not a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
general consensus that this is not a
threat<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:25.020> only<00:01:25.170> going

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
threat I think it is you're only going

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
threat I think it is you're only going
to<00:01:25.380> wear<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.799> watch<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> time<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to wear one watch at a time and if this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.929 
to wear one watch at a time and if this
hogs<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:28.049> wrist<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.729> less

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
hogs your wrist time then you're less

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.630 
hogs your wrist time then you're less
likely<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.450> buy<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.079> high-end<00:01:31.860> Swiss<00:01:32.340> watch

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
likely to buy a high-end Swiss watch

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.780 
likely to buy a high-end Swiss watch
this<00:01:33.119> could<00:01:33.329> very<00:01:33.360> easily<00:01:33.770> replace<00:01:34.790> high-end
