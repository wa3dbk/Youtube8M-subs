00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
straight line is there a method to this

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.859 
straight line is there a method to this
madness<00:00:20.350> oh<00:00:20.950> absolutely<00:00:21.700> yeah<00:00:22.450> that's<00:00:22.690> a<00:00:22.750> good

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
observation you have to consider what we

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.050 
observation you have to consider what we
call<00:00:25.869> your<00:00:26.230> approach<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.890> departure<00:00:27.130> angles

call your approach and departure angles

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.880 
call your approach and departure angles
of<00:00:28.509> where<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:28.960> can<00:00:29.110> lift<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.500> front<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.770> the

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
height your clearance height that's the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.960 
height your clearance height that's the
most<00:00:37.149> important<00:00:37.720> thing<00:00:38.310> very<00:00:39.310> important<00:00:39.850> to
