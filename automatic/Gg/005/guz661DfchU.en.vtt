00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.540
 how to make a set of table borough 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.940
 not that you need a roll of paper 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 yellow kraft two cardboard sheets 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 green felt pens a pair of scissors 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.760
 a tube of glue a tablespoon 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.470
 a flower- shaped hole punch 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 unwind and and stop in kraft paper 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:34.380
 yellow position t 2 green leaves on 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:38.190
 the side but not completely at the edge 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.309
 go and stick them on your yellow paper but 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.530
 good glue everywhere of course the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.530
 edges and of course in the middle 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.000
 do not forget to leave a space of 5 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.000
 cm about the edges 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.430
 teach the second sheet 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.130
 this is good state to stick all over the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.270
 edges in the middle and when he has it well 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.270
 against the first 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.980
 support well with the palm of your hands 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.980
 for that to be well glued everywhere 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 now cuts both edges which 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 remains always leaving a space 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:38.160
 about 5 cm that's the side and then 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.160
 now the top 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.150
 with your puncher you will make 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.480
 flowers on the yellow frame all around 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.110
 this is the space the flowers about 2 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.110
 cm 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.709
 that's done well on a regular basis 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.940
 for it to be pretty it's like a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:19.920
 frame but here you are losing strong you lose 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 strong all around that's on top 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:33.159
 and on the last side with the paper 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.159
 yellow kraft that you have left 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.489
 fold a triangle like that 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.350
 and cuts 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.019
 2 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.500
 you got a quarter is now 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 rolls the cone- shaped like a 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.530
 ice cream cone a little off here 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.349
 not kill the small point and you press 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.579
 well let's you let tulle crush and lapointe 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.510
 tulle to flap so it's in there that 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.510
 you can put the cutlery 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:26.500
 here you are going to stick it on the right of 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:30.209
 your placemats and glue here 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.209
 but everywhere everywhere as usual 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 green you can put your cutlery 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.190
 in now always with the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 yellow paper that remains you spread a small 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.790
 just like that take your spoon a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.239
 felt and draws the outline of the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:59.330
 spoon that will make you the shape of a 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:59.330
 egg a second and a third 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.370
 here is complete the bottom of the egg here is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:12.340
 with your felt and now cuts 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.340
 t3 us go we start with the first 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.019
 so I accelerate a little bit but 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.019
 you take your time 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.690
 this is the second is at the end of 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.690
 third 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.580
 now you're going decorations were they 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.870
 with markers 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.850
 so I chose to do some 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.860
 rounded like that so the first one with 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.360
 you can take the colors 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.230
 that you want and you can also do the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.230
 patterns you want 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.060
 this is the second I chose to do 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:57.590
 always rounded in red always 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.590
 you can do what you want 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.610
 you can make stars can make 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.810
 round you can make small dots and 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.810
 the third I do it in blue 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.320
 and now you're going to stick them on 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.710
 the other side of the table set 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.710
 it's a decoration 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.320
 here you put glue and you lose the 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.920
 first you will do the same thing with 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.920
 the second 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.330
 here you go you can stack them 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.330
 a little bit is pretty and the last 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.830
 here you can not be discovered 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.950
 in and prepare your table is very 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.950
 pretty
