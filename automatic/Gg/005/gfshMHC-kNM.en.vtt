 advocaat the legal expenses insurance 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.310
 the aachenmünchener folk welfare and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.310
 thuringian bolide problem 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:28.070
 with a neighbor full of envy 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.810
 is not good at eating cherries 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.730
 the fence will break even a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 dispute 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.980
 so it comes to processes 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.980
 legal protection is provided by the alliance 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.880
 complain to them 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.600
 and a higher one 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.600
 instance 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.500
 not the dispute-free 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 because who assures allianz 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.750

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 clear 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 There is good reason to refuel 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.890

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.920
 My lightest exercises are there 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.990
 but firm teeth have to clean naturally 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 you should also with the bike with the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.270
 Taga clear because data guard contains 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.200
 Chamomile mint and sage as nature 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.660
 herbal extracts in the green areas and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.490
 that could be seen there for 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.490
 strong gums and firm teeth 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 a theme

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.360
