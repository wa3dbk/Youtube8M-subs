00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 in this video we are going to see the things that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.560
 you have to obviously take into account the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 connect a memory to a processor and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.740
 the basic things of a computer by 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.770
 example when you are going to take out the processor 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.350
 from the box always grab it from the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.050
 sides and never the legs or the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.330
 top part where the fat goes 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.150
 Silicone always as delicately 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.630
 possible obviously before starting to 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.450
 work tries to touch something metallic and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.450
 if you have the tape that goes around 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.660
 your wrist you can use it to be able 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.690
 avoid any static discharge that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.670
 can get to have and burn some 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 component later with memories 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.989
 also fixed before grabbing the simple 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.239
 of the likes try not to touch the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.739
 little legs in this case, there's no problem 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 I can grab it like it's a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.420
 sandwich there are many people that I do not know for 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 what's the bad habit of grabbing 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 for example the platelets and fondle it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 all then if you have some kind of 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.140
 static 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 obviously does not have the tape that it does is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 download or download a component in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.990
 this case is an old platelet and not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.640
 it matters but I show it to you as 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 show because a lot of people that what 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320
 grab sil in any way it seems 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.110
 that is a blood so good what 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.190
 let's do in this case we place the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.080
 memory here 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.630
 and we always put pressure on 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.610
 sides trying to do the pressure 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.520
 on the plate is impossible and not 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.190
 on the heatsink so as not to damage it and that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.900
 Do not get out or loosen after 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.180
 with the plate 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.670
 then with the video plate the same to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.060
 always grab her on her side no less 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.690
 touch the electronics and the driveways a 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.910
 Once the cabinet is set to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.850
 later when you take out the protection of the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.670
 silicone fat processor in this 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 case try not to put your fingers or that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 is greased and if you put here the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 fingers by mistake treatment 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 internal with some cotton and alcohol 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 then put the processor as 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.209
 custom also when grabbing the made for 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.730
 you have to grab it from the sides 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.569
 where I recommend to take one of 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.980
 the boards as we can 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:31.239
 and you put it so that it lines up against 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.269
 the back panel and you're pushing it and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.769
 the lines until you can put the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.360
 screws also something else that can 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.159
 get to do something else that you can 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.950
 to do is to grab the heatsink's 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.489
 sides too but without forcing it much 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.590
 if they can get it out of the pci slots 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.650
 that they have to take out the sides for 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.450
 try not to touch anything that has 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.159
 electronic no contact then of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 that way you can avoid older dannielynn 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.290
