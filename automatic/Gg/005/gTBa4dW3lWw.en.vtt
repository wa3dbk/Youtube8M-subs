 description hello to everyone with you artem and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.300
 today all evil nsk show how to do 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 transparent wall for minecraft poket 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.080
 edishn and this wall can be done 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 only on can only be done on 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.969
 servers and so are watching 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.059
 we can't get out of here like you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 see so fly away look opa 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:49.640
 and here we have a ladder as you see 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 and this bug to use on the server 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 kintero if you played it then you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.789
 you know that there is some kind of incomprehensible 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 transparent wall and you can't just 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.610
 go through it so that's basically it so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.570
 being done you can climb it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 only from the other side here are the players in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.659
 perplexed they don't understand what 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 happens let's say 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.439
 and so how can we make it set 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.670
 so let's say let's say we set 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:40.380
 for example such a wall of blocks so 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:44.479
 we put so here everything is ready and now 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.479
 just breaking those blocks and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 and we get a wall so invisible 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:01.829
 of these of the stairs that is with 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.280
 the back of it is just not visible 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.269
 because in theory from the back 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.690
 should put the block but it is not so 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:16.379
 here you can use this bug 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.870
 houses so that other players could not clan 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:26.360
 go so I think it is very useful 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.459
 tank so then you need to remove these all 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.819
 I would also like to tell you what 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:37.349
 finalized modified all portals whale 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:42.049
 start and here is the portal jungle all 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:49.129
 here we have a simple jungle and so on 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:49.129
 so we write remember so 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.720
 what are all well here I basically told 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 you about this bug this bug does not work 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:07.860
 the truth doesn't work in ordinary worlds but 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 so it looks like here is shorter you 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.460
