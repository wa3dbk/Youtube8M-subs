to<00:03:34.320> charge<00:03:34.680> something<00:03:35.160> completely<00:03:36.090> probably

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
to charge something completely probably

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.010 
to charge something completely probably
the<00:03:36.810> phone<00:03:37.250> anyway<00:03:38.720> another<00:03:39.720> cool<00:03:39.960> thing

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
the phone anyway another cool thing

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.410 
the phone anyway another cool thing
about<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.700> best<00:03:41.970> things<00:03:42.240> I

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
about this one of the best things I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.070 
about this one of the best things I
think<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:46.400> say<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.460> have<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:48.300> proprietary

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
think is that say you have a proprietary

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.180 
think is that say you have a proprietary
plug<00:03:49.610> say<00:03:50.610> for<00:03:50.880> example<00:03:51.300> it's<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:52.190> Sony

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
plug say for example it's this Sony

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.940 
plug say for example it's this Sony
camera<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.880> I'm<00:03:53.970> using<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:55.350> has<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.710> super

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
camera that I'm using it has this super

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.050 
camera that I'm using it has this super
wonky<00:03:57.410> plug<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.890> goes<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> bottom<00:03:59.730> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
wonky plug that goes in the bottom it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.330 
wonky plug that goes in the bottom it
looks<00:04:00.300> like<00:04:00.540> micro<00:04:00.990> USB<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.680> it's<00:04:01.800> not<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.280> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
looks like micro USB but it's not it's a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.210 
looks like micro USB but it's not it's a
proprietary<00:04:02.640> Sony<00:04:03.420> piece<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.900> gosh<00:04:04.220> even

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
proprietary Sony piece of gosh even

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.500 
proprietary Sony piece of gosh even
though<00:04:05.280> their<00:04:05.430> customer<00:04:05.820> service<00:04:05.970> was<00:04:06.270> great

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
though their customer service was great

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.230 
though their customer service was great
when<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.200> camera<00:04:07.680> broke<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.640> nice<00:04:08.820> thing<00:04:09.060> is

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
when the camera broke the nice thing is

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.050 
when the camera broke the nice thing is
though<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.690> I'm<00:04:10.560> assuming<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.490> will<00:04:11.730> plug

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
though is I'm assuming this will plug

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.520 
though is I'm assuming this will plug
into<00:04:13.670> yeah<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:15.270> just<00:04:15.420> regular<00:04:15.660> USB<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.500> you

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
into yeah it's just regular USB so you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.380 
into yeah it's just regular USB so you
can<00:04:16.620> plug<00:04:16.739> them<00:04:16.980> into<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.520> then<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.239> can

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
can plug them into that and then you can

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.620 
can plug them into that and then you can
charge<00:04:18.630> from<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.380> anyway<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> saw<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.910> at

got this this is a 5 watt charger and

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.380 
got this this is a 5 watt charger and
from<00:04:46.590> what<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.740> can<00:04:46.830> tell<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> lot<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.940> lot

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
from what I can tell it's a lot a lot

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.790 
from what I can tell it's a lot a lot
higher<00:04:48.630> quality<00:04:48.770> than<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.980> one<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.850> got<00:04:51.450> ok<00:04:52.230> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
higher quality than the one I got ok so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.890 
higher quality than the one I got ok so
you<00:04:52.890> can<00:04:52.920> see<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.430> practical<00:04:54.060> application<00:04:54.810> of

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
you can see the practical application of

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.090 
you can see the practical application of
how<00:04:55.050> I'm<00:04:55.170> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.410> use<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.680> on<00:04:55.920> my

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
how I'm going to use this on my

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.300 
how I'm going to use this on my
motorcycle<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.910> have<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.930> tank<00:04:58.620> bag<00:04:58.830> here<00:04:59.100> with<00:04:59.280> a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
clear map window so basically that means

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.510
