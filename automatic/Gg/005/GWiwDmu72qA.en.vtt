it's kind of awkward you gotta get used

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.210 
it's kind of awkward you gotta get used
to<00:05:26.820> it<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.000> guess<00:05:27.180> what<00:05:27.800> unfolds<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:28.890> it<00:05:29.010> just

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
to it but guess what unfolds and it just

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.070 
to it but guess what unfolds and it just
swings<00:05:29.700> on<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:30.030> hinge<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.660> guess<00:05:30.840> what<00:05:31.050> I

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
swings on that hinge and guess what I

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.300 
swings on that hinge and guess what I
got<00:05:31.320> my<00:05:31.470> pic<00:05:31.650> back<00:05:33.230> so<00:05:34.230> I<00:05:34.560> would<00:05:34.830> recommend<00:05:35.220> if
