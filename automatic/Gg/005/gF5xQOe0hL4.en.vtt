00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.790

 from now on he is part of the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 a selection 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.349
 as a reward for his good performance 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.199
 in the past months 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.430
 moment to be proud of for you 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.869
 playing is still a race step but it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.519
 is definitely a he station the i would again 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 a starting point that he just needs 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.789
 going further is just in development 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.890
 boy hear that from their own training 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 containers say the first adds 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.650
 that is actually good for everyone 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650
 situation 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 the atmosphere is good 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 in the final training on the way to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 rkc waalwijk the next match that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 tomorrow is already at the door and it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 trust in a happy ending is great 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 you give a good feeling inside of the final 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.469
 gives confidence 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 certainly the way we played 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 and miss your important that we have that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 also want to see again in the competition 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 against rkc 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.059
 how is the team feeding well yes 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.730
 everyone is how everyone fits in 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.129
 We will complete group so we can 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.229
 with confidence to the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.260
 rkc then made there will also everything 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 be asked for a good one 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.119
 to win because they will 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.979
 we do something so nice cooked his dour 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 stiff team rkc 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.390
 do the very well in the competition they 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.190
 must be full again 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.380
 because the match on a half where you 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.580
 the ones that are pretty far back 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.200
 starts leaning 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.840
 yes games are normal 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.510
 quite withdrawn so think that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.750
 there will be the majority of the game 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.300
 take place but while plowing it too 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.340
 does try to play football 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.350
 who wants to come to the football but one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 gives very few opportunities 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 we are our challenges there ourselves 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.220
 lie to the next she can turn 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 and then that we hope to use 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.900
 rkc is the surprising number 9 in the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.340
 current division for PSV 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.530
 that there is really only one thing and that is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 the full profit only then remains the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 team participate in the battle for the title 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.630
 after it's not an all-or-nothing 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 contest but a girl that we 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.570
 have to win 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.479
 we are going that we setting to three points 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.979
 achieve that in objective and there 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 we will do everything about it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.530
 the way we try with good 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.780
 football to do what we strive for 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 Ultimately the result is on this 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.710
 moment determining 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 and that should be a profit so it 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.780
 is the same as the dirty one as the final 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 say win but no matter how 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.410
 well basically it comes to the same 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.970
 I also didn't want to be too easy about it 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.320
 do yes no matter how much 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.900
 football of course does matter 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.300
 but in the end it's about it 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.880
 results what appears when you get the cup 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.690
 wants to win, the competition would win 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 have to close 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.380
 sometimes it has to be done in a different way 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.910
 sometimes you have the light on 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.590
 his opponent of the shape of the day 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.239
 from ourselves 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.209
 true that the starting position of the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.640
 soccer player lasting you clover and stand and 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.489
 that is linking results to good 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.200
 football and we end with the man who 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.520
 from now on definitely in a red shirt 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.180
 trains 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.180
