00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
do it and it just takes forever so I use

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.310 
do it and it just takes forever so I use
my<00:00:37.950> herb<00:00:38.070> grinder<00:00:38.329> just<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.809> careful<00:00:40.290> that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.179 
important thing to do is to make sure
you<00:01:52.920> strain<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.060> particles<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> use

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you strain all the particles out so use
