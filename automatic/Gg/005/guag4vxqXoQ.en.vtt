if<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.599> take<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.050> instance<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.980> fire<00:00:11.219> science

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
if we take for instance the fire science

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.440 
if we take for instance the fire science
as<00:00:12.000> Aries<00:00:12.509> Sagittarius<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> Leo<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:15.299> go

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
as Aries Sagittarius and Leo they go

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630 
as Aries Sagittarius and Leo they go
well<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:15.870> each<00:00:15.960> other<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.710> they<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
well with each other because they have a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.790 
well with each other because they have a
similar<00:00:17.880> brand<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.199> put<00:00:19.410> them<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
similar brand and we put them with the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580 
similar brand and we put them with the
air<00:00:20.100> signs<00:00:20.460> Gemini<00:00:20.900> Aquarius<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.109> Libra

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
air signs Gemini Aquarius and Libra

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.880 
air signs Gemini Aquarius and Libra
these<00:00:23.100> are<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.580> combinations<00:00:24.390> fire<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.529> air

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
these are good combinations fire and air

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.150 
these are good combinations fire and air
combinations<00:00:26.670> work<00:00:26.939> well<00:00:27.210> together<00:00:27.420> they're

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
combinations work well together they're

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.700 
combinations work well together they're
complementary<00:00:29.160> couple<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.199> fire

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
complementary couple if you put fire

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.630 
complementary couple if you put fire
with<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.940> earth<00:00:33.300> or<00:00:33.829> air<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.370> water

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with water or earth or air with water

with water or earth or air with water
and<00:00:35.969> earth

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and earth

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.560 
and earth
you've<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:37.160> incompatible<00:00:38.160> elements<00:00:38.910> let<00:00:39.450> me

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you've got incompatible elements let me

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
you've got incompatible elements let me
explain<00:00:39.840> again<00:00:40.230> let's<00:00:40.590> think<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:40.920> fire<00:00:41.340> for

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
explain again let's think about fire for

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
explain again let's think about fire for
a<00:00:41.670> minute<00:00:41.790> fire<00:00:42.420> signs<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:43.020> Aries<00:00:43.440> Leo<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a minute fire signs like Aries Leo and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.090 
a minute fire signs like Aries Leo and
Sagittarius<00:00:44.149> those<00:00:45.149> spontaneous<00:00:45.770> quite<00:00:46.770> a

cautious it takes some time to come to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520 
cautious it takes some time to come to
how<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.309> feel<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.880> situation<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can see straight away that signs that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.090 
can see straight away that signs that
are<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> different<00:01:10.260> elements<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
are of different elements are going to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
are of different elements are going to
have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> job<00:01:12.330> getting<00:01:12.630> along

with each other
same<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.970> earth<00:01:15.180> let's<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
same really with earth let's think about

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.039 
same really with earth let's think about
Capricorn<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> Virgo<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> Taurus<00:01:18.390> very

sense of being materialistic but looking

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
sense of being materialistic but looking
at<00:01:25.470> things<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.189> practical

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
at things from a very practical

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.620 
at things from a very practical
standpoint<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> earth<00:01:28.799> group<00:01:29.250> tend<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> put

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
standpoint the earth group tend to put

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
standpoint the earth group tend to put
practicalities<00:01:31.439> first<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.670> think

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
practicalities first and then they think

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.179 
practicalities first and then they think
about<00:01:33.060> how<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.570> feel<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.950> again

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
about how they feel about it so again

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
about how they feel about it so again
you<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.640> earth<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.420> fire<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.140> instance

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you put earth with fire for instance

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
you put earth with fire for instance
which<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.460> let's<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> now

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
which is all about let's do it now

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420 
which is all about let's do it now
whereas<00:01:39.840> Earth<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> saying<00:01:40.530> hang<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> minute

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
whereas Earth is saying hang on a minute

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550 
whereas Earth is saying hang on a minute
do<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.000> enough<00:01:42.240> money<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.380> we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
do we have enough money do have we

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
do we have enough money do have we
thought<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> plan<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.659> how

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
thought about a plan you can see how

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.770 
thought about a plan you can see how
those<00:01:46.409> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> relationships<00:01:47.540> kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> gets
