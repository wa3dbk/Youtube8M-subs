00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
the first way is pretty simple play with

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.910 
the first way is pretty simple play with
a<00:00:49.910> team<00:00:50.240> of<00:00:50.270> people<00:00:50.450> that<00:00:50.900> you<00:00:51.260> know<00:00:51.470> so<00:00:51.770> play

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
a team of people that you know so play

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.860 
a team of people that you know so play
with<00:00:52.040> your<00:00:52.160> friends<00:00:52.450> try<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.690> full

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
lobby and yes so this will may not allow

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.450 
lobby and yes so this will may not allow
you<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.940> get<00:00:59.060> as<00:00:59.150> many<00:00:59.300> kills<00:01:00.310> but<00:01:01.310> will
