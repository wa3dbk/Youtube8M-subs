 the first idea was how to generate a little 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
 Babel's tower 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.470
 based on this over position 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.740
 elements and that it began to evolve 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 even if he did the idea of many 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.690
 elements of in a person's life 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.660

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.090
 of the piece apart from a postulate a 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.619
 bit a bit complex that we do not want 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.270
 that the public necessarily 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.500
 understand but they are simply the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 excuses that we have had 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.490
 gerentillo to create and think 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.020
 each of the scenes the sonority of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.119
 shostakovich is a pretty thing in 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 is in this symphony the octave is a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.289
 very disturbing thing there is a sound that and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.220
 melodies that generate many sensations 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.760
 and from those rhythms and those melodies 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.670
 we have tried to propose a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.599
 Energy 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.599
 and an integral mobility 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.850
 movement displacements twists

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.310
 walking mad and babylon we danced 4 days 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.220
 Thursday Friday to Sunday very physical very 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.730
 from top to bottom a lot of twisting is a no 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.140
 stop 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.980
 also the val is quite long that we 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.110
 I said 35 or 36 minutes 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.430
 30 is not quite long for what 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.870
 we are used to doing but good 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.670
 taking a little bit and the way that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.099
 there is little to dance is what you 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.750
 I say how are you inside that you go out 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.950
 you run up and down, no, you do not 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.970
 whole very well of what happens I think 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 that until we are on the stage 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.459
 with lights and others I have no idea what 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.819
 that is going to see me the music I like 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.890
 much a little strident sometimes yes a 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.480
 little is not very squared we are 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.480
 accustomed I also like it a lot
