00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to control that recoil if you're going

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.440 
to control that recoil if you're going
to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.329> aiming<00:00:36.719> accurately<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.270> when<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> got

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
to be aiming accurately so when I got

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.470 
to be aiming accurately so when I got
here<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> que<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.950> has<00:00:41.070> heavy<00:00:41.309> barrel<00:00:41.820> Cobra

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
here is a que it has heavy barrel Cobra

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.799 
here is a que it has heavy barrel Cobra
and<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.200> grip<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.600> I'm<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and for grip on it and I'm going to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
and for grip on it and I'm going to
start<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.829> holding<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
start off here by just holding down the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
start off here by just holding down the
trigger<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.390> no<00:00:48.600> adjustment<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> recoil<00:00:52.190> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
trigger with no adjustment to recoil so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
trigger with no adjustment to recoil so
you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.640> pretty<00:00:53.940> clearly<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> AEK

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you can see pretty clearly that the AEK

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.150 
you can see pretty clearly that the AEK
aims<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> left<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> i'd<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
aims up and to the left now i'd like to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
aims up and to the left now i'd like to
take<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> moment<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.120> talk<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.600> mouse

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
take a moment to just talk about mouse

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.700 
take a moment to just talk about mouse
settings<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:03.090> mouth<00:01:03.300> set<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.660> 1800<00:01:04.379> DPI

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
settings I have my mouth set at 1800 DPI

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
settings I have my mouth set at 1800 DPI
so<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.489> easy<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:06.240> nice<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.750> move

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so it's really easy really nice to move

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.679 
so it's really easy really nice to move

that<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.799> pull<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> right

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
that if I just pull down to the right

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.970 
that if I just pull down to the right
now<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.229> better

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.940 

this<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:55.970> myles<00:01:56.420> different<00:01:56.960> from<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.290> this

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
this is myles different from this this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.560 
this is myles different from this this
is<00:01:58.490> going<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.790> get<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.000> two<00:01:59.120> or<00:01:59.240> three<00:01:59.270> dome

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
is going to get you two or three dome

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.050 
is going to get you two or three dome
shots<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.070> hit<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.220> guy<00:02:01.460> once

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
shots this is going to hit the guy once

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.610 
shots this is going to hit the guy once
or<00:02:02.180> twice<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.720> then<00:02:03.200> you're<00:02:03.320> going<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.470> miss

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
or twice and then you're going to miss

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.109 
or twice and then you're going to miss
completely<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.340> die<00:02:04.790> in<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.030> process<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:08.060> you

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
completely and die in the process so you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.810 
completely and die in the process so you
can<00:02:08.360> learn<00:02:08.540> how<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.869> do<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.350> with<00:02:09.770> any<00:02:09.980> gun<00:02:10.310> it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
can learn how to do this with any gun it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.730 
can learn how to do this with any gun it
doesn't<00:02:11.210> matter<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.960> don't<00:02:12.140> need<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> stats

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
doesn't matter you don't need the stats

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.620 
doesn't matter you don't need the stats
you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.610> look<00:02:13.760> at<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.940> wall<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.180> shoot

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
you can just look at a wall and shoot

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.270 
you can just look at a wall and shoot
away<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:15.140> what<00:02:15.320> I've<00:02:15.410> got<00:02:15.590> here<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
away like what I've got here is the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.030 
away like what I've got here is the
sg553<00:02:17.120> I've<00:02:17.600> rarely<00:02:18.170> used<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.560> gun<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.950> I've

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
sg553 I've rarely used this gun so I've

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.800 
sg553 I've rarely used this gun so I've
taken<00:02:19.220> off<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.790> attachments<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.510> for

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
taken off all the attachments I have for

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.330 
taken off all the attachments I have for
it<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.050> I'm<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.770> learn<00:02:22.010> teach

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it and I'm just going to learn teach

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.710 
it and I'm just going to learn teach
myself<00:02:22.520> right<00:02:22.880> now<00:02:22.910> how<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.240> counter<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
myself right now how to counter the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.510 
myself right now how to counter the
recoil<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.210> can<00:02:29.330> see<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.950> goes<00:02:30.950> up<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
recoil so you can see this goes up and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.700 
recoil so you can see this goes up and
to<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:31.970> right<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.450> has<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:33.020> pretty<00:02:33.290> terrible

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
to the right and has a pretty terrible

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.010 
to the right and has a pretty terrible
squared<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.190> ask<00:02:34.310> me<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.750> what<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:35.930> going

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
squared if you ask me so what I'm going

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.870 
squared if you ask me so what I'm going
to<00:02:36.080> want<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.290> do<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.680> go<00:02:37.070> down<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.790> left

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
to want to do is go down and to the left

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.460 
to want to do is go down and to the left
but<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.420> doesn't<00:02:38.690> look<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:39.110> i'm<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
but it doesn't look like i'm going to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.310 
but it doesn't look like i'm going to
need<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> go<00:02:39.800> down<00:02:40.070> all<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.880> much<00:02:41.150> i'm<00:02:41.480> going

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
need to go down all that much i'm going

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.660 
need to go down all that much i'm going
to<00:02:42.410> need<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.920> left<00:02:43.130> quite<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.490> bit

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
to need to go to the left quite a bit

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.190 
to need to go to the left quite a bit
more<00:02:43.850> though<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.820> see<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.870> spread<00:02:51.110> is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
more though you can see the spread is

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.570 
more though you can see the spread is
pretty<00:02:51.350> terrible<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.740> this<00:02:51.860> gun<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.160> most<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
pretty terrible in this gun but most of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.350 
pretty terrible in this gun but most of
the<00:02:52.640> shots<00:02:52.850> are<00:02:53.150> right<00:02:53.630> where<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> was<00:02:54.080> aiming

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the shots are right where I was aiming

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.000 
the shots are right where I was aiming
it<00:02:56.360> still<00:02:56.720> miles<00:02:57.110> better<00:02:57.410> than<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:57.860> you

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
it still miles better than this and you

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.250 
it still miles better than this and you
can<00:02:58.040> do<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.550> without<00:02:58.820> ever<00:02:59.330> even<00:02:59.600> having<00:03:00.110> you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
can do this without ever even having you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.940 
can do this without ever even having you
as<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.470> weapon<00:03:00.620> before<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:02.380> can<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.530> look<00:03:03.740> at

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
as a weapon before you can just look at

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.670 
as a weapon before you can just look at
it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.250> counter<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.270> exactly<00:03:05.720> opposite<00:03:06.470> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
it and counter go exactly opposite the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.590 
it and counter go exactly opposite the
direction<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> recoil<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.090> taking<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
direction that the recoil is taking it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.380 
direction that the recoil is taking it
all<00:03:09.530> right<00:03:09.770> guys<00:03:09.920> I'm<00:03:10.160> back<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:10.640> with<00:03:10.940> my<00:03:10.970> AE

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
all right guys I'm back here with my AE

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.440 
all right guys I'm back here with my AE
k<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.920> same<00:03:13.130> setup<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.520> before<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.180> what<00:03:14.390> I'm

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
k the same setup as before and what I'm

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.240 
k the same setup as before and what I'm
going<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.690> try<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:14.930> teach<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.320> now<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.890> how<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
going to try and teach you now is how to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.330 
going to try and teach you now is how to
use<00:03:16.459> burst<00:03:16.790> fire<00:03:17.120> effectively<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:19.010> keep<00:03:19.190> your

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
use burst fire effectively to keep your

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.580 
use burst fire effectively to keep your
shots<00:03:19.550> on<00:03:19.730> target<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.300> saw<00:03:20.600> before<00:03:20.810> with

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
shots on target so you saw before with

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.570 
shots on target so you saw before with
the<00:03:21.709> AEK<00:03:22.130> even<00:03:22.489> when<00:03:22.640> counter<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.150> recoil

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
the AEK even when counter and recoil

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.820 
the AEK even when counter and recoil
still<00:03:25.580> has<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> pretty<00:03:26.060> highest<00:03:26.480> spread<00:03:26.830> now

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
still has a pretty highest spread now

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.520 
still has a pretty highest spread now
what<00:03:28.070> if<00:03:28.160> we<00:03:28.250> switch<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.489> burst<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.530> don't

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
what if we switch to burst and don't

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.690 
what if we switch to burst and don't
counter<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> recoil<00:03:31.310> at<00:03:31.459> all

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.940 

you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.850> see<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> much<00:03:37.920> better

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
you can see that this is a much better

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.430 
you can see that this is a much better
straight<00:03:38.730> line<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.480> still<00:03:39.750> going<00:03:39.960> slightly

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
straight line it's still going slightly

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.860 
straight line it's still going slightly
to<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.620> left<00:03:40.740> but<00:03:41.550> look<00:03:41.850> at<00:03:42.000> how<00:03:42.180> accurate

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
to the left but look at how accurate

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.140 
to the left but look at how accurate
these<00:03:43.080> shots<00:03:43.410> are<00:03:43.850> with<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> latest

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
these shots are with the latest

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.840 
these shots are with the latest
battlefield<00:03:45.690> 3<00:03:45.900> update<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:46.650> records<00:03:47.370> when

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
battlefield 3 update it now records when

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.650 
battlefield 3 update it now records when
after<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.300> die<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:50.130> use<00:03:50.640> burst<00:03:50.940> fire<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
after you die if you use burst fire it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.790 
after you die if you use burst fire it
didn't<00:03:51.900> used<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> do<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.530> was<00:03:52.620> really

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
didn't used to do that so it was really

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.730 
didn't used to do that so it was really
annoying<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.310> try<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.670> switch<00:03:53.940> but<00:03:54.570> now<00:03:54.780> it

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
annoying to try and switch but now it

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.830 
annoying to try and switch but now it
should<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:55.980> fairly<00:03:56.220> easy<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.540> guys<00:03:57.690> get

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
should be fairly easy if you guys get

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.030 
should be fairly easy if you guys get
used<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.110> using<00:03:58.230> burst<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:58.830> now<00:03:59.400> burst<00:03:59.670> fire

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
used to using burst but now burst fire

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.830 
used to using burst but now burst fire
when<00:04:02.040> counting<00:04:02.400> recoil<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.060> lot<00:04:09.360> better<00:04:09.480> to

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
when counting recoil is a lot better to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.270 
when counting recoil is a lot better to
say<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.020> least<00:04:10.080> hey<00:04:10.770> kind<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.040> made<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> little

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
say the least hey kind of made a little

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.300 
say the least hey kind of made a little
happy<00:04:11.460> face<00:04:12.050> but<00:04:13.050> yeah<00:04:13.650> look<00:04:14.100> at<00:04:14.190> this

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
happy face but yeah look at this

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.600 
happy face but yeah look at this
difference<00:04:15.020> if<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.860> learn<00:04:17.100> how<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.340> control

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
difference if you learn how to control

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.520 
difference if you learn how to control
your<00:04:17.850> recoil<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.690> use<00:04:18.989> burst<00:04:19.260> fire

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
your recoil and use burst fire

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.220 
your recoil and use burst fire
effectively<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.660> almost<00:04:21.900> one

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
effectively you can be almost one

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.050 
effectively you can be almost one
hundred<00:04:22.410> percent<00:04:22.650> accurate<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.610> mean<00:04:24.030> just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
hundred percent accurate I mean just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
hundred percent accurate I mean just
look<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> difference<00:04:25.290> between<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:25.740> two

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
look at the difference between these two

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.420 
look at the difference between these two
alright<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.260> by<00:04:28.830> now<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.040> might<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:29.400> wondering

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
alright so by now you might be wondering

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.970 
alright so by now you might be wondering
what<00:04:30.270> do<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.450> do<00:04:30.510> if<00:04:30.720> my<00:04:30.750> gun<00:04:31.110> doesn't<00:04:31.620> have

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
what do I do if my gun doesn't have

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.130 
what do I do if my gun doesn't have
burst<00:04:32.400> fire<00:04:32.670> or<00:04:32.940> doesn't<00:04:33.300> have<00:04:33.450> single<00:04:33.930> fire

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
burst fire or doesn't have single fire

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.930 
burst fire or doesn't have single fire
well<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.740> easiest<00:04:34.800> thing<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.310> do<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.640> make

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
well the easiest thing to do is to make

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.940 
well the easiest thing to do is to make
your<00:04:36.210> own<00:04:36.390> burst<00:04:36.810> fire<00:04:37.080> what<00:04:37.680> I've<00:04:37.770> got<00:04:37.920> here

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
your own burst fire what I've got here

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.330 
your own burst fire what I've got here
is<00:04:38.160> my<00:04:38.340> pkp<00:04:39.120> trusty<00:04:39.810> pkp<00:04:40.320> kills<00:04:41.190> all<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
is my pkp trusty pkp kills all the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.900 
is my pkp trusty pkp kills all the
baddies<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.800> it's<00:04:43.800> an<00:04:43.980> LMG<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.550> we<00:04:44.610> all<00:04:44.730> know

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
baddies and it's an LMG so we all know

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.940 
baddies and it's an LMG so we all know
that<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.270> spread<00:04:45.900> its<00:04:46.140> recoil<00:04:46.470> they're<00:04:46.830> all

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
that it's spread its recoil they're all

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.440 
that it's spread its recoil they're all
going<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.280> pretty<00:04:47.460> horrendous<00:04:47.760> I'm<00:04:48.240> just

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
going to be pretty horrendous I'm just

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.420 
going to be pretty horrendous I'm just
going<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.630> hold<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> down<00:04:49.080> here

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.180 

and<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:57.060> can<00:04:57.210> see<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.690> pkp<00:04:58.470> pretty<00:04:58.800> much

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
and you can see that the pkp pretty much

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.879 
and you can see that the pkp pretty much
goes<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.759> but<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:00.840> hard<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.410> even<00:05:01.470> tell

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
goes up but it's hard to even tell

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.409 
goes up but it's hard to even tell
because<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.250> spread<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.879> just<00:05:03.180> yeah<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.270> going

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
because the spread is just yeah so going

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.749 
because the spread is just yeah so going
back<00:05:06.539> over<00:05:06.810> here<00:05:07.080> we<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:07.740> make<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:07.919> version<00:05:08.340> of

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
back over here we can make a version of

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.969 
back over here we can make a version of
our<00:05:08.909> own<00:05:09.090> verse<00:05:09.389> for<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:09.840> gun<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.860> way

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
our own verse for this gun and the way

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.369 
our own verse for this gun and the way
that<00:05:11.099> we<00:05:11.190> can<00:05:11.340> do<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.729> is<00:05:11.909> learn<00:05:12.569> how<00:05:12.870> this

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
that we can do that is learn how this

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.700 
that we can do that is learn how this
gun<00:05:13.819> recovers<00:05:14.819> from<00:05:14.940> its<00:05:15.120> recoil<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.780> then

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
gun recovers from its recoil and then

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.420 
gun recovers from its recoil and then
use<00:05:16.979> that<00:05:17.009> time<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.819> fire<00:05:18.599> in<00:05:18.780> short<00:05:19.009> 325<00:05:20.009> round

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
use that time to fire in short 325 round

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.290 
use that time to fire in short 325 round
bursts<00:05:21.000> like<00:05:21.120> I'm<00:05:21.360> doing<00:05:21.659> here<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:24.030> can<00:05:24.150> see

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
bursts like I'm doing here you can see

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.899 
bursts like I'm doing here you can see
this<00:05:24.479> is<00:05:24.629> a<00:05:24.659> nice<00:05:24.930> tight<00:05:25.259> little<00:05:25.440> cunt<00:05:25.909> now

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
this is a nice tight little cunt now

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.510 
this is a nice tight little cunt now
each<00:05:27.630> weapon<00:05:28.020> recovers<00:05:28.800> from<00:05:29.009> recoil

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
each weapon recovers from recoil

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.969 
each weapon recovers from recoil
differently<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.479> can<00:05:30.630> see<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:30.810> LMGs<00:05:31.560> are

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
differently you can see that LMGs are

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.710 
differently you can see that LMGs are
pretty<00:05:32.490> heavy<00:05:32.699> weapons<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:33.360> they<00:05:33.389> take<00:05:33.659> a

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
pretty heavy weapons so they take a

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.689 
pretty heavy weapons so they take a
while<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:34.169> recover<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:35.009> see<00:05:35.190> as<00:05:35.310> soon<00:05:35.520> as<00:05:35.610> I

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
while to recover you see as soon as I

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.649 
while to recover you see as soon as I
shoot<00:05:37.430> there's<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.520> probably<00:05:39.090> about<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.270> third

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
shoot there's a probably about a third

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.050 
shoot there's a probably about a third
to<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:40.050> half<00:05:40.199> of<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.889> second<00:05:41.340> there<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:41.970> it

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
to a half of a second there that it

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.290 
to a half of a second there that it
takes<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.419> recover<00:05:42.599> from<00:05:42.930> one<00:05:43.289> bullet<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:44.550> you

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
takes to recover from one bullet so you

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.820 
takes to recover from one bullet so you
can<00:05:45.449> either<00:05:45.569> hold<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.080> down<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.620> try<00:05:46.800> to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
can either hold it down and try to

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.640 
can either hold it down and try to
recover<00:05:47.099> from<00:05:47.250> recoil<00:05:49.819> and<00:05:51.020> you<00:05:52.020> end<00:05:52.199> up<00:05:52.349> with

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
recover from recoil and you end up with

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.939 
recover from recoil and you end up with
a<00:05:52.710> pretty<00:05:53.449> spread<00:05:54.449> out<00:05:54.479> cone<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.199> bullets<00:05:55.560> that

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
a pretty spread out cone of bullets that

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.230 
a pretty spread out cone of bullets that
really<00:05:56.219> isn't<00:05:56.310> going<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:56.550> be<00:05:56.639> that<00:05:56.669> i<00:05:56.819> heerd<00:05:57.120> at

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
really isn't going to be that i heerd at

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.959 
really isn't going to be that i heerd at
all<00:05:57.389> i<00:05:57.630> mean<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:59.069> the<00:05:59.280> guy's<00:05:59.400> head<00:05:59.610> was<00:05:59.789> right

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
all i mean if the guy's head was right

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.290 
all i mean if the guy's head was right
here<00:06:00.590> you<00:06:01.590> wouldn't<00:06:01.889> if<00:06:01.979> it<00:06:02.069> in<00:06:02.159> once<00:06:02.340> if<00:06:03.180> the

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
here you wouldn't if it in once if the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.209 
here you wouldn't if it in once if the
guy's<00:06:03.449> head<00:06:03.630> was<00:06:03.810> right<00:06:03.960> here<00:06:04.319> you<00:06:04.919> could<00:06:05.099> have

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
guy's head was right here you could have

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.250 
guy's head was right here you could have
hit<00:06:05.340> him<00:06:05.460> two<00:06:05.580> or<00:06:05.610> three<00:06:05.819> different<00:06:05.969> times

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.010 

so<00:06:08.860> in<00:06:09.130> conclusion<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.790> guys<00:06:10.000> can<00:06:10.420> see<00:06:10.690> that

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
so in conclusion you guys can see that

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.780 
so in conclusion you guys can see that
there<00:06:11.200> are<00:06:11.230> three<00:06:11.920> different<00:06:12.250> things<00:06:12.610> that

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
there are three different things that

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.240 
there are three different things that
you<00:06:12.940> need<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.240> learn<00:06:13.450> about<00:06:13.750> your<00:06:14.050> gun<00:06:14.260> the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
you need to learn about your gun the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.860 
you need to learn about your gun the
first<00:06:15.460> thing<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.700> need<00:06:15.790> to<00:06:15.850> do<00:06:16.060> is<00:06:16.300> take<00:06:16.840> it

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
first thing you need to do is take it

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.810 
first thing you need to do is take it
out<00:06:17.140> anywhere<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.950> shoot<00:06:18.370> it<00:06:18.520> without

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
out anywhere and shoot it without

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.730 
out anywhere and shoot it without
recovering<00:06:19.450> your<00:06:19.570> recoil<00:06:19.900> see<00:06:20.290> where<00:06:20.470> it<00:06:20.590> goes

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
recovering your recoil see where it goes

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.370 
recovering your recoil see where it goes
and<00:06:21.100> learn<00:06:21.910> from<00:06:21.940> this<00:06:22.330> map<00:06:22.600> of<00:06:22.780> bullets<00:06:23.170> it

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
and learn from this map of bullets it

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.070 
and learn from this map of bullets it
tells<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:24.130> a<00:06:24.340> treasure<00:06:25.240> trove<00:06:25.540> of<00:06:25.780> things

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
tells you a treasure trove of things

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.780 
tells you a treasure trove of things
that<00:06:26.290> you<00:06:26.440> can<00:06:26.620> use<00:06:26.890> to<00:06:27.160> make<00:06:27.400> you<00:06:27.610> more

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
that you can use to make you more

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.810 
that you can use to make you more
accurate<00:06:28.210> with<00:06:28.300> your<00:06:28.420> gun<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:30.340> second<00:06:30.700> thing

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
accurate with your gun the second thing

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.210 
accurate with your gun the second thing
you<00:06:30.850> need<00:06:31.030> to<00:06:31.060> learn<00:06:31.300> is<00:06:31.540> how<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.500> counter<00:06:33.070> that

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
you need to learn is how to counter that

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.810 
you need to learn is how to counter that
recoil<00:06:33.670> you<00:06:34.540> want<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.840> go<00:06:35.250> exactly<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.580> two

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
recoil you want to go exactly the two

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.880 
recoil you want to go exactly the two
opposite<00:06:37.450> directions<00:06:37.570> if<00:06:38.080> your<00:06:38.230> recoil<00:06:38.590> is

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
opposite directions if your recoil is

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.310 
opposite directions if your recoil is
pulling<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:39.280> up<00:06:39.490> pull<00:06:40.210> down<00:06:40.450> obviously<00:06:41.140> all

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
pulling you up pull down obviously all

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.990 
pulling you up pull down obviously all
ricos<00:06:41.710> are<00:06:41.860> going<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.100> pull<00:06:42.280> you<00:06:42.400> up<00:06:42.580> that's

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
ricos are going to pull you up that's

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.850 
ricos are going to pull you up that's
just<00:06:43.150> an<00:06:43.270> example<00:06:43.330> if<00:06:44.170> your<00:06:44.320> recoil<00:06:44.650> is

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
just an example if your recoil is

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.400 
just an example if your recoil is
pulling<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.250> to<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:45.520> right<00:06:45.820> then<00:06:46.630> pull<00:06:46.960> to

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
pulling you to the right then pull to

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.230 
pulling you to the right then pull to
the<00:06:47.440> left

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.390 

the<00:06:51.810> third<00:06:52.110> and<00:06:52.410> final<00:06:52.470> thing<00:06:53.130> that<00:06:53.280> you're

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
the third and final thing that you're

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.550 
the third and final thing that you're
going<00:06:53.430> to<00:06:53.610> want<00:06:53.729> to<00:06:53.849> know<00:06:54.030> is<00:06:57.289> using<00:06:58.289> burst

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
going to want to know is using burst

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.390 
going to want to know is using burst
fire<00:06:58.860> and<00:07:00.139> to<00:07:01.139> use<00:07:01.319> burst<00:07:01.650> fire<00:07:01.949> you<00:07:02.250> can

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
fire and to use burst fire you can

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.020 
fire and to use burst fire you can
either<00:07:02.610> use<00:07:03.139> the<00:07:04.340> designated<00:07:05.340> first<00:07:05.580> fire<00:07:05.819> on

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
either use the designated first fire on

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.480 
either use the designated first fire on
the<00:07:06.210> weapon<00:07:06.440> or<00:07:07.440> you<00:07:07.650> can<00:07:07.830> learn<00:07:08.099> how<00:07:08.130> the

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
the weapon or you can learn how the

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.300 
the weapon or you can learn how the
weapon<00:07:08.789> recovers<00:07:09.509> from<00:07:09.840> recoil<00:07:10.410> learn<00:07:11.099> the

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
weapon recovers from recoil learn the

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.980 
weapon recovers from recoil learn the
amount<00:07:11.520> of<00:07:11.580> time<00:07:11.759> that<00:07:11.789> it<00:07:12.000> takes<00:07:12.090> for<00:07:12.389> heavier

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
amount of time that it takes for heavier

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.260 
amount of time that it takes for heavier
weapons<00:07:13.380> it<00:07:13.500> usually<00:07:13.770> takes<00:07:14.009> a<00:07:14.280> longer<00:07:15.000> amount

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
weapons it usually takes a longer amount

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.330 
weapons it usually takes a longer amount
of<00:07:15.509> time<00:07:15.599> as<00:07:15.870> you<00:07:15.960> can<00:07:16.080> see<00:07:16.259> over<00:07:16.740> here<00:07:16.770> from<00:07:17.190> my

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
of time as you can see over here from my

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.749 
of time as you can see over here from my
pkp<00:07:17.970> bullets<00:07:18.979> but<00:07:19.979> with<00:07:20.130> lighter<00:07:20.340> weapons

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 
pkp bullets but with lighter weapons

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.309 
pkp bullets but with lighter weapons
like<00:07:20.880> assault<00:07:21.180> rifles<00:07:21.569> it<00:07:21.810> won't<00:07:21.960> take<00:07:22.139> that

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 
like assault rifles it won't take that

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.070 
like assault rifles it won't take that
phone<00:07:22.470> a<00:07:22.680> weapon<00:07:23.039> like<00:07:23.069> the<00:07:23.280> f2000<00:07:24.180> will<00:07:24.870> take

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
phone a weapon like the f2000 will take

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.140 
phone a weapon like the f2000 will take
not<00:07:25.650> that<00:07:25.860> long<00:07:26.039> to<00:07:26.220> recover<00:07:26.430> from<00:07:26.580> its<00:07:26.759> recoil

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
not that long to recover from its recoil

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.520 
not that long to recover from its recoil
so<00:07:27.449> even<00:07:27.659> though<00:07:27.690> it<00:07:27.840> doesn't<00:07:27.990> have<00:07:28.169> a<00:07:28.199> burst

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
so even though it doesn't have a burst

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.170 
so even though it doesn't have a burst
mode<00:07:28.800> you<00:07:28.919> can<00:07:28.949> still<00:07:29.220> be<00:07:29.340> fairly<00:07:29.580> accurate

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
mode you can still be fairly accurate

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.360 
mode you can still be fairly accurate
with<00:07:30.330> it<00:07:30.360> by<00:07:30.840> just<00:07:31.050> firing<00:07:31.289> and<00:07:31.770> short<00:07:32.039> three

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
with it by just firing and short three

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.510 
with it by just firing and short three
to<00:07:32.490> five<00:07:32.669> round<00:07:32.970> bursts<00:07:33.889> so<00:07:34.889> that<00:07:35.099> is<00:07:35.280> it<00:07:35.310> for

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
to five round bursts so that is it for

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.930 
to five round bursts so that is it for
