00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
enough that it's going to be a factor to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.500 
enough that it's going to be a factor to
some<00:00:22.680> extent<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> wind<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> light

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
some extent and if the wind is light

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.290 
some extent and if the wind is light
then<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.470> big<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.679> deal<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
then it's not that big a deal you know I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.140 
then it's not that big a deal you know I
there's<00:00:27.300> always<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.519> effect<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> ball<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
there's always a effect on the ball and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
there's always a effect on the ball and
the<00:00:30.449> ball<00:00:30.570> handling<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.080> that's<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.500> what

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the ball handling so that's that's what

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.749 
the ball handling so that's that's what
we<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> consider<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.670> bit

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
we have to consider a little bit

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.710 
we have to consider a little bit
sometimes<00:00:32.970> with<00:00:33.270> catching<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> football

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
sometimes with catching the football

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.200 
sometimes with catching the football
there<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.860> three<00:00:35.820> four<00:00:35.969> plays<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
there can be you know three four plays a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
there can be you know three four plays a
game<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> guys<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
game of the guys and they don't make the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.080 
game of the guys and they don't make the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
place they normally make but so it just

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.700 
place they normally make but so it just
depends<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> wind<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
