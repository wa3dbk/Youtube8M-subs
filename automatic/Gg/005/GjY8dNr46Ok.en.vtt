think that's part of what creates the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.069 
think that's part of what creates the
opportunity<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.880> farther<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.359> go<00:01:59.719> from

we're<00:02:09.679> often<00:02:09.860> asked<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.369> compare<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> three

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
we're often asked to compare the three

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.880 
we're often asked to compare the three
because<00:02:11.570> they're<00:02:11.750> all<00:02:11.900> categorized<00:02:12.470> as

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
emerging I would argue that they're

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.860 
emerging I would argue that they're
emergent<00:02:15.920> by<00:02:16.160> now<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:16.970> I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
emergent by now but I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.660 
emergent by now but I
I<00:02:17.900> think<00:02:18.500> they<00:02:18.650> all<00:02:18.860> pose<00:02:19.190> different

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
I think they all pose different

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.490 
I think they all pose different
