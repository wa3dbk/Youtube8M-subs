00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.369 

turn<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:38.120> Stegner<00:00:39.890> fold<00:00:40.890> corners<00:00:42.140> into<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
turn it Stegner fold corners into the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
turn it Stegner fold corners into the
center<00:00:43.559> crease<00:00:51.230> like<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
center crease like that and the same to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.580 
center crease like that and the same to
the<00:00:54.539> other<00:00:54.570> sides<00:00:55.070> both<00:00:56.070> sides<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.640> touching

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.900 

should<00:01:01.220> look<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:07.630> take<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:08.930> top<00:01:09.290> edge

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
should look like this take this top edge

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:20.300 
should look like this take this top edge
and<00:01:11.080> bring<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.200> down<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:16.120> crease

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.030 

looks<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.549> an<00:01:21.670> unbeliever

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.010 

fold<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.630> corner<00:01:29.020> center<00:01:30.020> line<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:32.300> an<00:01:32.600> angle

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
fold this corner center line on an angle

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.150 
fold this corner center line on an angle
so<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.100> should<00:01:34.220> look<00:01:34.370> like<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:36.160> then

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
so it should look like this and then

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.670 
so it should look like this and then
it's<00:01:37.280> named<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.730> other<00:01:37.880> side<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> both

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
it's named to the other side so both

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.910 
it's named to the other side so both
points<00:01:40.130> are<00:01:40.220> moving<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.330> center

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.100 

should<00:01:48.920> look<00:01:49.100> like<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:50.230> now<00:01:51.230> take<00:01:53.110> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
should look like this now take this

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:08.810 
should look like this now take this
point<00:01:54.440> right<00:01:54.770> here<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:58.090> fold<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.300> up

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820

and<00:02:09.820> just<00:02:10.450> take<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.840> side<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.440> fold<00:02:19.350> that's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
and just take this side and fold that's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.470 
and just take this side and fold that's
time<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.920> make<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> wings<00:02:22.830> easy<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.240> take
