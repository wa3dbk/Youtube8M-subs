never happened but apparently the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.780 
never happened but apparently the

over NFC that are going to be announced
at<00:02:20.670> Google<00:02:20.700> i/o<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.600> then<00:02:21.870> again<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> biggest

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
at Google i/o but then again the biggest

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.200 
at Google i/o but then again the biggest
question<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.100> who's<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.640> care<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.060> nobody

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
question is who's gonna care if nobody

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.960 
question is who's gonna care if nobody
actually<00:02:24.570> uses<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> service<00:02:25.650> yet<00:02:25.860> we'll<00:02:26.760> see

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
actually uses the service yet we'll see

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.240 
actually uses the service yet we'll see
and<00:02:27.330> finally<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> hot<00:02:28.680> news<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.070> day

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
and finally for the hot news of the day

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.530 
and finally for the hot news of the day
we've<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.640> got<00:02:29.880> some<00:02:30.120> leaked<00:02:30.330> specifications

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
we've now got some leaked specifications

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080 
we've now got some leaked specifications
of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.350> follow-up<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> google<00:02:32.460> nexus<00:02:32.580> 7

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
of the follow-up to the google nexus 7

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.370 
of the follow-up to the google nexus 7
which<00:02:33.270> we<00:02:33.450> still<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:33.750> know<00:02:34.020> if<00:02:34.170> it'll<00:02:34.320> be

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
which we still don't know if it'll be

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.890 
which we still don't know if it'll be
called<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.070> Nexus<00:02:35.430> 7<00:02:35.850> hopefully<00:02:36.510> that'll<00:02:36.690> be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
called the Nexus 7 hopefully that'll be

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900 
called the Nexus 7 hopefully that'll be
the<00:02:37.020> case<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.410> apparently<00:02:38.130> it'll<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.460> made<00:02:38.730> by

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the case but apparently it'll be made by

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.610 
the case but apparently it'll be made by
a<00:02:38.940> sous<00:02:39.270> again<00:02:39.600> it'll<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.260> an<00:02:40.380> interesting

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
a sous again it'll have an interesting

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.370 
a sous again it'll have an interesting
resolution<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.460> 1920<00:02:42.210> x<00:02:42.360> 1200<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
resolution in 1920 x 1200 which is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.990 
resolution in 1920 x 1200 which is
better<00:02:43.500> than<00:02:43.650> 1080p<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.490> can't<00:02:44.820> imagine

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
better than 1080p I just can't imagine

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
better than 1080p I just can't imagine
the<00:02:45.270> form<00:02:45.510> factor<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.170> resolution<00:02:46.440> but

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the form factor for that resolution but

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.950 
the form factor for that resolution but
aside<00:02:47.550> from<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.760> we're<00:02:48.030> also<00:02:48.180> getting<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.630> 5

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
aside from that we're also getting a 5

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.900 
aside from that we're also getting a 5
megapixel<00:02:49.230> back<00:02:49.950> camera<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.550> wasn't

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
megapixel back camera that wasn't

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.430 
megapixel back camera that wasn't
available<00:02:51.120> before<00:02:51.450> it'll<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.080> wireless

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
available before it'll have wireless

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.830 
available before it'll have wireless
charging<00:02:53.130> which<00:02:53.700> also<00:02:54.000> was<00:02:54.330> an<00:02:54.480> available

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
charging which also was an available

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.140 
charging which also was an available
before<00:02:55.020> but<00:02:55.410> even<00:02:55.830> better<00:02:56.130> apparently<00:02:57.030> this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
before but even better apparently this

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.850 
before but even better apparently this
will<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> first<00:02:57.900> device<00:02:58.260> out<00:02:58.500> there<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
will be the first device out there to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.550 
will be the first device out there to
rock<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.280> Snapdragon<00:02:59.970> 800<00:03:00.450> processor<00:03:00.480> or<00:03:01.380> at

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
rock the Snapdragon 800 processor or at

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.260 
rock the Snapdragon 800 processor or at
least<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> first<00:03:02.070> tablet<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.120> think

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
least the first tablet I just think

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.420 
least the first tablet I just think
about<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.750> Tegra<00:03:04.140> 3<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.280> only

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
about it the Tegra 3 was really the only

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.360 
about it the Tegra 3 was really the only
bad<00:03:05.970> part<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.690> original<00:03:06.900> Nexus<00:03:07.440> 7<00:03:07.770> aside

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
bad part of the original Nexus 7 aside

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.920 
bad part of the original Nexus 7 aside
from<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.610> display<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.570> leads<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
from the display but that leads you to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.810 
from the display but that leads you to
the<00:03:10.020> question<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.440> day<00:03:10.500> what<00:03:11.430> would<00:03:11.640> be

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820
