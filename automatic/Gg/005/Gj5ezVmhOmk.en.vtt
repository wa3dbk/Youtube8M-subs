00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.730
 When jobs are wiped out, companies are often ahead of it 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.689
 Problem that they do not simply dissolve existing employment contracts 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.509
 Then, so-called transfer companies can become active the these 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.430
 Collect workforces Siegfried Backes that he is with me 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.050
 Managing director of his transfer company of the personnel 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.179
 Transfer GmbH and Pratt have already published a book on the subject 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.909
 but immediately met to speak 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.619
 Mr Backes, please explain to our audience once again what for 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.649
 do you need transfer companies and what exactly are they doing? 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.060
 Transfer companies basically 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.430
 because masses break down a company and now that is one 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.430
 Build big business wild of breaks 200 people 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.749
 some work council 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.840
 and companies either on operational layoffs 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 or on the alternative to this termination a transfer companies 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.650
 that means it is agreed on the one hand, the resolution of the old 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.820
 ratio 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.210
 as a liquidation contract and a fixed term contract with the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.220
 Transfer company usually over a year 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.520
 There, people insist for St in ours 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 Southern you go, so to speak, the notice periods 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.490
 otherwise, the contractual situation looks sober 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.900
 because as I said so on the one hand Resolution unlike temporary 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.880
 Employment conditions Employment means in this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.500
 Connection curiously 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.410
 0 hours of work 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.060
 that means it is not allowed to work the social welfare office area remuneration but 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.860
 At this time, people are working solely on their careers 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.410
 including the time is the limited time 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.640
 usually a year because the employment office for a year 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.610
 This transfer supports the so-called us for 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.760
 Kurzarbeitergeld 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.250
 he is just as much for the unemployment benefit a year as more 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.430
 What happens when the time has run out, namely, if you want to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.930
 the time limit has expired, others are people either in breadwinner 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.690
 or they sign up 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.350
 Percent have been unemployed 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.729
 Labor market but with this certain delay without giving them benefits 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.700
 lost because they were previously rhinoceros socialization in other words 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.080
 the employer the old basically buys free 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.379
 he buys himself that way 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.430
 Percent of the long notice periods but that's also true 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.719
 not so Aubauer I'm actually in a company no longer work 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.970
 That's why you still have to do nothing in detail 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.540
 So you can make better use of the time by looking at it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.810
 In good time to take care of a new job at an early stage 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.189
 Paid employee 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.620
 the employee is paid in height and next to it a social plan 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:30.620
 is agreed 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.669
 usually 80 to 85 percent of the old nato fee 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.390
 So much more than the unemployment benefit but just less 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.439
 So you work 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 and percent 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.959
 the money will be funded over the unemployed percent oct so serve 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.790
 TransFair Kurzarbeiter toppen it is now on the other side percent on 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.519
 which also by the top-up amount ways the donating company Zoom 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.059
 and they look after the staff and it's basically the goal in the first one 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.719
 To re-let the job market exclusively for our purpose 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.430
 Care starts where we look at the people very very precisely so 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.720
 that's the first, so to speak 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.920
 quality component of our work, how do we look at the people who look 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 we what your strengths and weaknesses are which 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.709
 Poverty Zion they bring with which calendar they have percent 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.270
 to create a new image for a new job, so to speak 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.850
 More con assume that well over 90 percent of people are above us 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.699
 landing 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.609
 not the old jobs again 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.479
 So you can record in the supposed funding pot but rather a passerby 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.309
 he was able to speak in the book to talk about her book transfer companies 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.799
 ice age 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.620
 Feichtner just into the camera what is it about exactly and be like a judge 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.629
 that's it 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.620
 So it is Bucher's claim to be a standard work and now 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.769
 Per cent because there the questions are answered which are all involved 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.420
 If they then consider us or we use that 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.640
 Instrument Transfergesellschaft there are, of course, the companies the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.300
 it is written on for the works councils that they know experience 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.810
 learns in other companies were then open the agency for 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.880
 Work percent position the federal agency un-representative and says 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.260
 what at the moment the current legal regulations it us the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.850
 History of the transfer and, of course, the current problems in 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.790
 In a post by me Ben Spies, students learn the songwriter duo and 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.789
 workers 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.719
 if all mentioned last how do you see the future of 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.479
 Transfer companies where does it all lead 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.430
 Transfer companies eat as it were from two sources to avoid 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.759
 next to them they are, so to speak, the other side of the coin 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.199
 notice periods 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.650
 want to say if the notice periods from today to tomorrow to a two months 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.099
 shortened while Answer companies dead 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.459
 that is clear because then there is no reason is so to speak the people percent 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:49.580
 to catch up differently 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.130
 the second is they dine out there because the legislature is formally waiting 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.449
 that the people here are looked after better than by the employment offices 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.680
 that is probably the case 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.059
 Percent as far as I could the investigation 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.539
 On average, we average about 36% across the nationwide average 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.949
 all the employment offices at about 18 19 percent are of course also from 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.849
 Dependable on every project if we have good academics nationwide 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.400
 we already had dream quotas of 98 percent 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.849
 So that can not be said how it ends 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.199
 So you can say it is a highly topical subject that has us for sure 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.599
 Next I thank you first for the conversation 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.309
