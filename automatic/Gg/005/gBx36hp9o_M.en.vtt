00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.780
 the evolutionary process that ferrari f 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
 138 proceeds in close stages Nov i 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.890
 vertical flow correctors below 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 use works in synergy with the interior 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.110
 in van vent vents on the bellies 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.270
 to improve air expulsion 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.090
 warm from the radiators to ensure 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.829
 the optimal heat exchange 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.219
 this solution has been replicated at 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.050
 unloading side with same functionality for 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 maximize heat evacuation 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.400
 to the bodywork on the gearbox side was 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 equipped with three wide slits 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.790
 dimensions that reveal a lot 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 efficient thanks to the field of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.290
 depression at the rear axle which amplifies 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.810
 the high extraction effect 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.460
 temperatures 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.350
 mercedes focused on 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 seeking a greater deportant effect 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.600
 on the rear axle to contain the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 degradation of the rear-end tires 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.079
 a radical review of the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 aerodynamic interactions of wing ed 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.129
 extractor led to integration 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.829
 of a new slide with geometry 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.929
 modified to maximize the effect of 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.909
 air intake from under the car 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.909
 to the benefit of the load values 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.220
 new evolutionary package for rb 9 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 which focuses attention in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.260
 sub-frame integrating a new pair 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 of wider and shaped deflectors 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.880
 allow you to convey more 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.660
 air flow rate at the bottom ensuring a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.520
 more rejected aerodynamic load 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.340
 to the brake solution with movable elements 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.250
 red bull technicians have been forced 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.440
 by the technical commission to restore 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.869
 the standard drum set-up the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.090
 carbon with side vents 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.490
 conveyed to the center wheel by fins 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 facing outwards 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.170
 an additional slot in the part 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 frontal with vertical development 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.220
 maximizes the evacuation effect of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.640
 hot flows and therefore the capacities of 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.640
 cooling down
