00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.789
 every morning when we wake up I 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 think more I will save people 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.779
 and the more I would be denied 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.090
 and it was only a matter of time 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.449
 before meeting one that is too much 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.449
 powerful 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.650
 so that I can defeat him 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.300
 I am really sorry for the delay 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.310
 I had a traffic problem 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.320
 traffic problems it would not be 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.220
 rather I do not know how to have a guy who 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.220
 would you say to the submachine gun 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 yes yes that of course that's what I 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.410
 alluded 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.290
 peter parker are you born 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.780
 I'll show you something that will 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.580
 interest in the score you watch yourself from 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.030
 near why 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.530
 that's the question of the day I would say 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.290
 although you do not tell me everything in peace 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:10.150
 remember what you say it is created 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.770
 no price just like the truth my name 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.020
 is richard parker I discovered 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 how to score would exploit my 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.780
 research 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 it's my responsibility to protect 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.140
 the world of what they are capable of 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 do that the future 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.960
 literally changed the world and for 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 Peter everyone does not have an end 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.020

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.830
 I made a choice 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 It's my destiny 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.920

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 world 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.780
 without energy 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340
 without mercy
