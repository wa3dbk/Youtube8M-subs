00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700 
good thing um I'm actually maybe even a
little<00:02:05.219> more<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> side<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.200> being<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
little more on the side of it being a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430 
little more on the side of it being a
good<00:02:08.009> thing<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.450> funimation<00:02:09.840> like

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
good thing because the funimation like

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.640 
good thing because the funimation like
listen<00:02:10.830> Funimation<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:12.270> company

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
listen Funimation is a company

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.149 
listen Funimation is a company
if<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.670> compare<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.329> Disney<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.650> poor

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
if you compare it to Disney it's a poor

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.929 
if you compare it to Disney it's a poor
ass<00:02:17.790> company<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.439> it's<00:02:20.010> nothing<00:02:20.579> compared

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
ass company it's it's nothing compared

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.979 
ass company it's it's nothing compared
to<00:02:21.030> Disney<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.640> Disney<00:02:23.640> buys<00:02:23.989> Funimation

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
to Disney so if Disney buys Funimation

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.179 
to Disney so if Disney buys Funimation
that<00:02:25.980> means<00:02:26.930> Disney's<00:02:27.930> money<00:02:28.260> will<00:02:28.829> go<00:02:28.860> to

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
that means Disney's money will go to

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.399 
that means Disney's money will go to
Funimation<00:02:30.120> well<00:02:30.720> pretty<00:02:30.989> much<00:02:31.079> because<00:02:31.290> it's

Funimation well pretty much because it's

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.140

one piece at this moment ninety-nine

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.559 
one piece at this moment ninety-nine
percent<00:02:55.159> that<00:02:56.159> one<00:02:56.790> piece<00:02:57.000> will<00:02:57.209> never<00:02:57.359> get

percent that one piece will never get
finished<00:02:57.720> dubbed<00:02:58.079> cuz<00:02:58.560> there's<00:02:59.090> 500<00:03:00.090> episodes

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
finished dubbed cuz there's 500 episodes

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390 
finished dubbed cuz there's 500 episodes
about<00:03:00.659> 500<00:03:01.200> almost<00:03:01.470> 500<00:03:01.829> episodes<00:03:01.889> out<00:03:02.220> in

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
about 500 almost 500 episodes out in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.860 
about 500 almost 500 episodes out in
Japan<00:03:02.670> right<00:03:02.819> now<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.150> there's<00:03:03.359> nothing<00:03:03.689> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
Japan right now and there's nothing to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.589 
Japan right now and there's nothing to
be<00:03:03.959> another<00:03:04.200> 500<00:03:04.889> or<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.879> thinking<00:03:06.510> about

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
be another 500 or more so thinking about

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.259 
be another 500 or more so thinking about
how<00:03:06.959> Funimation<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.739> works<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.849> doesn't

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
how Funimation you know works it doesn't

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.379 
how Funimation you know works it doesn't
seem<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.659> it<00:03:09.810> would<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:09.959> dubbed<00:03:10.349> incomplete

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
seem like it would be dubbed incomplete

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.800 
seem like it would be dubbed incomplete
so<00:03:12.389> if<00:03:12.689> Disney<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:14.220> Disney<00:03:14.790> takes<00:03:15.090> over<00:03:15.569> maybe

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so if Disney if Disney takes over maybe

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.069 
so if Disney if Disney takes over maybe
they<00:03:16.109> could<00:03:16.260> push<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:17.579> piece<00:03:17.879> on<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.510> TV<00:03:18.870> maybe

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
they could push one piece on to TV maybe

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.319 
they could push one piece on to TV maybe
like<00:03:19.319> disney<00:03:19.709> XD<00:03:19.889> like<00:03:20.430> james<00:03:20.639> j<00:03:20.879> man<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.269> know

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
like disney XD like james j man you know

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.759 
like disney XD like james j man you know

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
he said that in this video AP put

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.599 
he said that in this video AP put
they'll<00:03:22.949> push<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.459> disney<00:03:24.209> XD<00:03:24.239> um<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:26.190> you

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
they'll push it on disney XD um with you

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.110 
they'll push it on disney XD um with you
know<00:03:26.730> maybe<00:03:27.030> having<00:03:27.389> havenít<00:03:27.930> rival<00:03:28.470> uh

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
know maybe having havenít rival uh

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.270 
know maybe having havenít rival uh
having<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.269> rival<00:03:30.720> with<00:03:30.989> an<00:03:31.199> art<00:03:31.470> oh<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.159> all

having it rival with an art oh and all

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.470 
having it rival with an art oh and all
so<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.449> think<00:03:34.379> like<00:03:35.069> Disney<00:03:35.970> will<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
so I think like Disney will have the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.470 
so I think like Disney will have the
money<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.049> actually<00:03:37.290> advertise<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.639> maybe<00:03:38.849> put

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
money to actually advertise it maybe put

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240 
money to actually advertise it maybe put
some<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.109> little<00:03:40.379> advertising<00:03:40.889> on<00:03:41.129> their

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
website and get because i think i think

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.689

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
the disney website and disney

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.219 
the disney website and disney
advertising<00:03:45.479> work<00:03:45.629> so<00:03:45.810> much<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.079> than

wow<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.609> different<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:09.750> know<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.739> if

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
wow this is so different you know so if

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.000 
wow this is so different you know so if
Disney<00:04:11.760> had<00:04:12.030> put<00:04:12.989> put<00:04:13.440> money<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.859> advertise

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
Disney had put put money to advertise

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.180 
Disney had put put money to advertise
and<00:04:14.699> all<00:04:14.970> on<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.510> stuff<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.680> think

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and all on this stuff I think I think

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.699 
and all on this stuff I think I think
Disney<00:04:17.579> could<00:04:17.789> actually<00:04:17.909> get<00:04:18.389> anime<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.320> lot

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
Disney could actually get anime a lot

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.310 
Disney could actually get anime a lot
more<00:04:19.919> popular<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.609> I'm<00:04:20.880> actually<00:04:21.389> more<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.139> the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
more popular so I'm actually more on the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.360 
more popular so I'm actually more on the
side<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:23.010> fun<00:04:24.050> Funimation<00:04:25.050> would<00:04:25.440> if<00:04:25.710> disney

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
side that fun Funimation would if disney

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.410 
side that fun Funimation would if disney
bought<00:04:26.520> out<00:04:26.760> Funimation

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
bought out Funimation

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.090 
bought out Funimation
it<00:04:27.660> would<00:04:27.750> actually<00:04:27.900> be<00:04:28.140> better<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.920> then

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
it would actually be better but then

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.050 
it would actually be better but then
then<00:04:29.820> again<00:04:30.380> here's<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.650> bad<00:04:31.980> points<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.910> in

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
then again here's the bad points that in

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.370 
then again here's the bad points that in
my<00:04:33.180> opinion<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.660> disney<00:04:34.050> bought<00:04:34.200> at

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
my opinion if disney bought at

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.940 
my opinion if disney bought at
Funimation<00:04:35.100> they<00:04:35.880> might<00:04:36.210> drop<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:37.080> crapload<00:04:37.620> of

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
Funimation they might drop a crapload of

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.790 
Funimation they might drop a crapload of
series<00:04:39.890> cuz<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.910> more<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.420> kids<00:04:42.960> kids

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
series cuz this is more about kids kids

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.400 
series cuz this is more about kids kids
thing<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.220> know<00:04:44.310> kids<00:04:44.640> company<00:04:45.450> it's<00:04:46.170> more

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
thing you know kids company it's more

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.360 
thing you know kids company it's more
based<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:47.130> kids<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:48.690> don't<00:04:49.560> think<00:04:49.770> they

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
based for kids and I don't think they

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.390 
based for kids and I don't think they
would<00:04:50.670> be<00:04:50.700> able<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.270> handle<00:04:51.570> all<00:04:52.530> these<00:04:52.950> a

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
would be able to handle all these a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.790 
would be able to handle all these a
cheese<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:53.940> Funimation<00:04:54.810> has<00:04:54.990> licensed<00:04:55.590> to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
cheese that Funimation has licensed to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.120 
cheese that Funimation has licensed to
so<00:04:56.130> Disney<00:04:57.000> buys<00:04:57.270> out<00:04:57.510> Funimation<00:04:58.380> no<00:04:58.950> more

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
so Disney buys out Funimation no more

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.020 
so Disney buys out Funimation no more
edges<00:04:59.730> will<00:04:59.880> be<00:05:00.000> licensed<00:05:00.570> up<00:05:02.030> hopefully

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
edges will be licensed up hopefully

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.380 
edges will be licensed up hopefully
nothing<00:05:03.720> will<00:05:04.350> get<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.520> censored<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.210> hope

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
nothing will get to censored I hope

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.600 
nothing will get to censored I hope
deals<00:05:06.660> but<00:05:07.380> they<00:05:07.860> would<00:05:08.040> still<00:05:08.070> release<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
deals but they would still release the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.600 
deals but they would still release the
uncut<00:05:09.210> box<00:05:09.540> sets<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.310> understand<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.460> get

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
uncut box sets I understand it get

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260

maybe they will just do by Funimation
and<00:05:34.410> maybe<00:05:34.560> they'll<00:05:34.800> turn<00:05:35.130> something

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.030 
but from where I'm looking at now
Funimation<00:05:41.700> isn't<00:05:42.150> doing<00:05:42.720> that<00:05:42.750> well<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.800> my

right<00:05:51.210> now<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:52.020> if<00:05:52.230> Disney<00:05:52.680> takes<00:05:52.920> over
