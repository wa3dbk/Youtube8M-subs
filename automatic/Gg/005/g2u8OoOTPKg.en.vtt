00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
really good but on the other side the
disappointing<00:01:34.110> things<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> worrying

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
disappointing things or the worrying

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
disappointing things or the worrying
things<00:01:35.369> let's<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.729> call<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> no

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
things let's just call them there is no

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
things let's just call them there is no
single<00:01:37.770> player<00:01:37.950> campaign<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
single player campaign and I don't

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
single player campaign and I don't
understand<00:01:39.630> why<00:01:39.869> they're<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.290> doing<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
understand why they're not doing this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.810 
understand why they're not doing this
because<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.220> mean<00:01:41.460> they've<00:01:41.579> done

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
because I mean they've done

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
because I mean they've done
single-player<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> games<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
single-player to a lot of the games and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
single-player to a lot of the games and
they<00:01:44.340> could<00:01:44.490> easily<00:01:44.759> done<00:01:45.119> something<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they could easily done something like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
they could easily done something like
this<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.380> time<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.680> understand<00:01:47.220> why

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this but the same time I understand why

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
this but the same time I understand why
because<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.479> gone<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
because if they would have gone in a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
because if they would have gone in a
different<00:01:49.619> direction<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.700> Star<00:01:50.909> Wars

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
different direction with the Star Wars

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
different direction with the Star Wars
sort<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> franchising<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.680> hate<00:01:52.920> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
sort of franchising but it would hate on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
sort of franchising but it would hate on
a<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.460> hurry<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.110> didn't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
a go hurry that's not right you didn't

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
a go hurry that's not right you didn't
do<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> right<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.189> maybe<00:01:56.630> maybe<00:01:57.630> that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
do it right there so maybe maybe that's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
do it right there so maybe maybe that's
one<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> reasons<00:01:58.799> why<00:01:59.040> didn't<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> actually

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
one of the reasons why didn't I actually

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
one of the reasons why didn't I actually
do<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> single<00:02:00.360> play<00:02:00.570> even<00:02:00.840> though<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.740> can

that's pretty much it so that's kind of
the<00:03:00.790> information<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.569> know<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.930> far<00:03:01.959> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
the information that we know so far I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.009 
the information that we know so far I
know<00:03:03.099> there's<00:03:03.400> been<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.849> little<00:03:04.060> gameplay<00:03:04.450> seen

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
know there's been a little gameplay seen

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.330 
know there's been a little gameplay seen
by<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> couple<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> people<00:03:05.920> but<00:03:06.069> they're<00:03:06.190> not
