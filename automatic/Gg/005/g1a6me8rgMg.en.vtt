00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.430
 many personalized with hope home 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.800
 some already have some friends 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.439
 an absolute wrong message have that 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.750
 also correct what we confirm 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.930
 Can this be a delegation today? 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.510
 under the guidance of here a rose of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.440
 sport managers from hofheim here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 we had a nice conversation 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.770
 have informed us that they agree 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.269
 be with the philipp hosiner 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.340
 That said, that's nice, but she 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.170
 know that in this case three parties 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.920
 this includes both clubs and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 the player 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
 because we are also festive 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 including the option philipp still 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 three years speaks relationships 2016 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 have found and accordingly of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.320
 munch wiegel also communicated 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.399
 any ambition here is a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.530
 to agree to change 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 but because we do that again and again 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 have said if there is a request 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.649
 then we just have the respect and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.460
 sit down with the interested one 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.080
 partner but it was basically one 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 nice meeting if you call it that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.729
 but wants an exchange of opinions 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 not at all that there is one here 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 agreement or an approach or what 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.119
 had always existed and is with it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.670
 as it has been said again and again 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 have fact is 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.119
 many posener has another three years 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 us de facto contract and has now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 holiday and on 24 06 like the others 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.300
 Team players take a part out of it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.459
 Regarding record you can say something 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.590
 the next steps are 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.270
 this is now on my husband 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.330
 lies exclusively with hope home we 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 have made it clear to you that we are whole 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.990
 We also have clear ideas 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.130
 already decided in the supervisory board because 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.069
 that, too , no secret of it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.920
 made in the last few weeks that we 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.360
 have to reckon with these scenarios 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.800
 just like the philipp himself 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.929
 last year presented as 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.819
 scorer king national player 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.220
 there would have been blue eyes if it was not 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.380
 that is how we are but we have very clear 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.690
 Ideas and just when it still is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.929
 almost a three-year bond exists because 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.610
 philippines was one year with us 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.590
 then of course it's a completely different one 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.220
 economic dimension and there already 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.680
 hope the representatives of hope 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.420
 very definite but friendly clear 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
 you can now officially say 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.020
 niko kovac is a candidate there 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.670
 other candidates we have too 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.800
 not hiding that will be 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.580
 speak in person or through 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.560
 telephone calls lead so as the competent 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.740
 board sports it here, so to speak 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.110
 the one who sets the clock and one 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.120
 the talks was a joint of 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.220
 us two yesterday afternoon with the niko 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.630
 kovac but no at all 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.160
 Negotiations have generally been conducted 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.080
 has exchanged like ours 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 he imagines his philosophy 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.270
 has set out we have a clear 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680
 Requirement profile created and now 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.110
 the talks continue 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.480
 and if we then of opinion are the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 is the candidate or that is the one 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.209
 sequence 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.740
 then you would be already with bite 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.120
 At Peter Stöger, it was easy 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.640
 our rules of procedure 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.500
 propose to the supervisory board and each 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.240
 after how the vote is whether this 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.400
 Person under new coach is or how 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 what else is he doing ralph 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.140
 hasenhüttl a candidate ralph hasenhüttl 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.019
 is someone who ver 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.420
 Requirements are largely fulfilled 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.709
 have that also set out where 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.269
 you have to say that ralph 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.980
 hasenhüttl but now very very long in 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.870
 germany has worked the visana 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.640
 but players out there, but still 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.560
 now very very long in Germany 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.230
 lived and also as a coach actually 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 until now only worked in Germany 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.540
 and that's why there are others 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.370
 Candidates said to have been abroad from abroad 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.030

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.980
 viewed 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.160
 as I said the task from the cathedral square to 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.910
 family so to speak these talks this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.799
 to conduct information talks 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.600
 of course, a financial 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.360
 dimension to consider but just 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.010
 as I said, other factors and then 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.230
 finally come to an end for me 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.670
 this will be proposed to the supervisory Board 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.459

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.930

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.320
 this and drop into the natural medial 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.880

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.180
 The Easter Eclipse Year no 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.180
 candidate
