aging let's talk a little UFOs you know
I'm<00:00:28.250> skeptical<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> reporter<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I'm skeptical because as a reporter I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
I'm skeptical because as a reporter I
realize<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> could<00:00:31.170> prove<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> existence

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
realize if you could prove the existence

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.490 
realize if you could prove the existence
of<00:00:32.189> UFOs<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:33.149> produce<00:00:33.660> an<00:00:33.809> alien<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> would

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
of UFOs or produce an alien you would

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.370 
of UFOs or produce an alien you would
make<00:00:34.710> gazillions<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:36.180> dollars<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.809> mean<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
make gazillions of dollars I mean it is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
make gazillions of dollars I mean it is
a<00:00:37.410> huge<00:00:37.980> industry<00:00:38.340> even<00:00:38.640> though<00:00:38.700> nobody<00:00:39.030> has

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a huge industry even though nobody has

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
a huge industry even though nobody has
produced<00:00:39.570> anything<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.559> saying<00:00:40.800> if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
produced anything some saying if

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.450 
produced anything some saying if
something<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:42.829> provable<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> would<00:00:44.340> have

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
something was provable it would have

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.910 
something was provable it would have
been<00:00:44.640> done<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.149> say<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.680> kind

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
been done I say I don't think that kind

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.700 
been done I say I don't think that kind
of<00:00:47.129> proof<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.760> subjected<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.750> making<00:00:49.559> money

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of proof is subjected to making money

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.799 
of proof is subjected to making money
and<00:00:49.980> profit<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.539> more

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and profit I think it's much more

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
and profit I think it's much more
important<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> truth<00:00:53.010> there<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.340> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
important to know the truth there it is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
important to know the truth there it is
to<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:53.760> money<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> bill<00:00:54.539> no<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.170> but

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to make money on it bill no I know but

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.400 
to make money on it bill no I know but
if<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.800> were<00:00:56.329> aliens<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.539> UFOs<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:58.020> whatever

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
if there were aliens or UFOs or whatever

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.810 
if there were aliens or UFOs or whatever
life<00:00:58.710> another<00:00:59.010> planet<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.399> somebody<00:00:59.699> knew

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
life another planet and somebody knew

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
life another planet and somebody knew
about<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.899> bring<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> out

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
about it they would just bring it out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 
about it they would just bring it out
because<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because it would be it would be so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.590 
because it would be it would be so
valuable<00:01:04.339> no<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.060> maybe<00:01:06.270> more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
valuable no I think it's maybe more

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
valuable no I think it's maybe more

the<00:01:35.820> idea<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.870> I<00:01:36.900> am<00:01:37.230> pretty<00:01:37.800> sure<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.400> fact<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the idea that I am pretty sure in fact I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.420 
the idea that I am pretty sure in fact I
know<00:01:38.940> military<00:01:39.720> intelligence<00:01:40.110> knows<00:01:41.010> and

know military intelligence knows and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.180 
know military intelligence knows and
they<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.390> proof<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.980> would<00:01:44.160> that

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
they have proof but now what would that

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.570 
they have proof but now what would that
do<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.380> released<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
do if they really released it you know

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.430

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
think the reason it's been suppressed is

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.860 
think the reason it's been suppressed is
because<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.579> suppressing<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.239> for<00:02:30.569> our

because they are suppressing it for our

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.259 
because they are suppressing it for our
own<00:02:31.230> good<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.859> think<00:02:32.219> that<00:02:32.579> we<00:02:32.730> might<00:02:32.969> panic
