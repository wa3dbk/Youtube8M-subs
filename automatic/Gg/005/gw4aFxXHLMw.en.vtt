00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.050
 all of my life 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.570
 well or all the time that i remember i was 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.960
 a man who didnâ€™t like to go out 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.700
 the street and you know from the beginning of everything 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.610
 this zombie apocalypse saw more 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.020
 sunlight than the past 3 years 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.480
 spent all the time in the city and it was 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.989
 the first time i walked near my 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.720
 home I in cars and John 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.800
 we all went well we were looking for food 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.070
 I know what we find here and know how 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.329
 movie where they show thousands of zombies where 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.820
 nor spit and their number is not clear all 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.619
 people turned into zombies and there were a lot of them 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.649
 especially in my hometown and one of 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.530
 they almost nearly killed the world but here these 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.600
 a zombie cat cried such a feeling that everything 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.790
 took and piled on the weekend somewhere and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.170
 left to guard only a couple 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.720
 zombies are not the best surprise but 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.229
 if you think 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:35.140
 things could be much worse i could be 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:36.790
 dead that we are still lucky 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.619
 sense of anal a day is often no one 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 just imagine if you are persistent 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.520
 dissidents everything is a back comedian 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.350
 lads style lost bay to pieces 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.330
 this toddler would leave the clock and even 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.100
 months i'm good that there are no women with us 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 beat the field buy into the world they were afraid 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.060
 this place seems familiar to me 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 wanna say see this is my 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 native home 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.570
 this is where to talk there is not safe i 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.570
 long 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
 Hey 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:32.500
 where about you still think lovely 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.500
 let's go for it will answer yes 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 keen so he already went from here 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.319
 it seems this building is abandoned 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.780
 at least see no zombies 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.510
 inside and u in general if i were a zombie 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.000
 the bank would be the last place I would be 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 wanted to go don't think after death 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.019
 people also wanted to be an accountant this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.019
 let's check it out 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.140
 They are here to think about the scope of the calculation as 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.450
 why do you think there are so few zombies around 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.040
 maybe they all hoofed back so fast 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.170
 maybe they killed everyone except the nation 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 happily died of starvation I 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.459
 I think that zombies eat each other so 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.920
 more they smell foul years of paper on 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.650
 delicious written code and they have such 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.810
 same smell yes but in general it's true i 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.980
 noticed it a long time ago when I felt 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.840
 the smell of sour milk in my house and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.489
 I noticed then that I was in general 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.260
 milk did you like where did I get it 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.450
 I can have only one 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.330
 I wonder if the tooth smells so why 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.380
 so does not smell the dogs of the task smells like 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.680
