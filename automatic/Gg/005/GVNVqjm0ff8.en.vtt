so<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.839> when<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> put<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.279> sled<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.720> cut

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
so that when I put the sled on I can cut

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.120 
so that when I put the sled on I can cut
a<00:00:27.869> hole<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> bottom<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.679> it'll<00:00:28.890> slide

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
a hole in the bottom and it'll slide

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
a hole in the bottom and it'll slide
down<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.269> I'll<00:00:30.359> drill<00:00:30.599> two<00:00:30.839> holes

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
down there and then I'll drill two holes

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.420 
down there and then I'll drill two holes
right<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:33.590> it'll<00:00:34.590> secure<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.280> place

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
right here and it'll secure it in place

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
right here and it'll secure it in place
and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:35.910> I'll<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.240> more<00:00:36.450> bolts<00:00:37.440> up

and then I'll do some more bolts up

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.840 
and then I'll do some more bolts up
front<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.680> I'll<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.830> that<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.430> move

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
welded on to be able to clamp the slide

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.279 
welded on to be able to clamp the slide
in<00:01:37.310> place<00:01:37.610> I'm<00:01:38.149> just<00:01:38.539> gonna<00:01:38.780> take<00:01:39.049> two<00:01:39.259> of

heads<00:01:41.179> off<00:01:41.710> right<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.149> then<00:01:44.149> I'm<00:01:44.420> gonna

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
heads off right there and then I'm gonna

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.679 
heads off right there and then I'm gonna
place<00:01:44.899> them<00:01:45.170> around<00:01:46.009> there<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.520> weld<00:01:47.299> them<00:01:47.509> in

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
place them around there and weld them in

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.289 
place them around there and weld them in
so<00:01:48.679> that<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.340> threads<00:01:49.610> are<00:01:49.729> gonna<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:50.000> flush

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
so that the threads are gonna be flush

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.090 
so that the threads are gonna be flush
the<00:01:50.719> head<00:01:50.929> won't<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.259> on<00:01:51.350> there<00:01:51.530> anymore<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the head won't be on there anymore and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.219 
the head won't be on there anymore and
then<00:01:52.909> I'll<00:01:53.030> drill<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.299> hole<00:01:53.569> through<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.929> slide

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
then I'll drill a hole through the slide

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.270 
then I'll drill a hole through the slide
and<00:01:54.819> I'll<00:01:55.819> be<00:01:55.969> able<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.240> bolt<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.959> down<00:01:57.280> so

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and I'll be able to bolt it down so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.740 
and I'll be able to bolt it down so
after<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.579> do<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.819> I'm<00:01:59.209> gonna<00:01:59.329> drill<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
after I do that I'm gonna drill the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.429 
after I do that I'm gonna drill the
holes<00:01:59.929> in<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.229> sled<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:01.750> we'll<00:02:02.750> see<00:02:03.349> how

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
holes in the sled and then we'll see how

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:21.430 
holes in the sled and then we'll see how
it<00:02:03.590> looks

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.800 

and<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.210> what<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.480> should<00:02:24.630> look<00:02:24.690> like

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and this is what it should look like

00:02:24.810 --> 00:03:01.310 
and this is what it should look like
when<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.590> cut<00:02:25.770> off<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.360> clean<00:03:01.200> up

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
when you have it cut off so I clean up

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.960 
when you have it cut off so I clean up
the<00:03:01.410> meadow<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.890> grinder<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.520> then<00:03:02.850> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the meadow with the grinder and then I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.170 
the meadow with the grinder and then I
took<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.540> vise<00:03:03.840> grip<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:05.090> supported<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
took a vise grip and supported the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.670 
took a vise grip and supported the
bullet<00:03:06.480> straight<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.080> made<00:03:07.290> sure<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.500> was

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
bullet straight up I made sure it was

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.320 
bullet straight up I made sure it was
leveled<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.700> I'm<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.210> do<00:03:09.300> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
leveled and now I'm just going to do a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:31.250 
leveled and now I'm just going to do a
few<00:03:09.570> tacks<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.140> hold<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.500> place

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:53.849 

and<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:31.890> I'll<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.220> other<00:03:32.340> side

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.599 

well<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.760> far<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:57.560> drilled<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.129> holes<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
well so far I I drilled the holes to the

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.640 
well so far I I drilled the holes to the
sled<00:03:58.969> and<00:03:59.150> I've<00:04:00.049> bolted<00:04:00.379> it<00:04:00.680> all<00:04:00.799> together

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
sled and I've bolted it all together

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.709 
sled and I've bolted it all together
there's<00:04:03.650> two<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.159> bolts<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.909> then<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.510> put

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:05.719 
there's two of the bolts and then I put

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.449 
there's two of the bolts and then I put
four<00:04:06.019> bolts<00:04:06.409> holding<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.920> those<00:04:07.310> are

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
four bolts holding that those are

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.830 
four bolts holding that those are
quarter<00:04:07.790> inch<00:04:07.969> bolts<00:04:08.450> they're<00:04:08.629> pretty

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
quarter inch bolts they're pretty

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.229 
quarter inch bolts they're pretty
heavy-duty<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.799> that<00:04:10.639> seems<00:04:10.939> to<00:04:11.060> be<00:04:11.120> working

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
heavy-duty and that seems to be working

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.339 
heavy-duty and that seems to be working
great<00:04:11.689> so<00:04:12.560> now<00:04:12.709> it's<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:12.980> time<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:14.139> take<00:04:15.139> the

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
great so now it's just time to take the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.680 
great so now it's just time to take the
tongue<00:04:15.560> bolt<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.280> up<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.239> then<00:04:17.449> I'm<00:04:17.539> gonna

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
tongue bolt that up and then I'm gonna

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.199 
tongue bolt that up and then I'm gonna
finish<00:04:18.440> up<00:04:18.739> all<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.100> welds<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.639> then<00:04:19.820> spray

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
finish up all the welds and then spray

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.290 
finish up all the welds and then spray
paint<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.600> black<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> let's<00:04:22.370> do<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:23.060> then

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
paint it black so let's do that and then

on here front I thought I'd just show it
to<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> didn't<00:04:35.509> show<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:35.900> me<00:04:36.199> I<00:04:36.380> didn't

show<00:04:36.830> me<00:04:36.979> building<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:38.020> because<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.050> thought

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
show me building it because I thought

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.800 
show me building it because I thought
that<00:04:39.380> if<00:04:40.160> you're<00:04:40.430> doing<00:04:40.639> something<00:04:41.389> like<00:04:41.509> this

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
that if you're doing something like this

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.960 
that if you're doing something like this
you<00:04:41.870> could<00:04:42.289> design<00:04:42.620> it<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.310> way<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.460> want<00:04:43.699> for

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
you could design it the way you want for

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.930 
you could design it the way you want for
what<00:04:44.120> you're<00:04:44.330> pulling<00:04:44.509> it<00:04:44.750> with<00:04:45.250> but<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.789> me<00:04:46.910> I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
what you're pulling it with but for me I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.300 
what you're pulling it with but for me I
just<00:04:47.389> built<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.900> frame<00:04:48.470> off<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.949> front<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
just built a frame off the front of the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.760 
just built a frame off the front of the
sled<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.849> then<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.720> hinge<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:51.169> with<00:04:51.560> two

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
sled and then a hinge here with two

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.089 
sled and then a hinge here with two
bolts<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.400> comes<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.720> tongue<00:04:54.470> over<00:04:54.979> to

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
bolts that comes to the tongue over to

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.159 
bolts that comes to the tongue over to
the<00:04:55.190> front<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.610> tongue<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.090> there's<00:04:57.080> a

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
the front of the tongue and there's a

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.330 
the front of the tongue and there's a
spring<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:58.849> when<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.180> pull<00:05:00.039> with<00:05:01.039> the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
spring so that when you pull with the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.330 
spring so that when you pull with the
four-wheeler<00:05:02.240> or<00:05:02.479> snowmobile<00:05:02.889> it<00:05:03.889> doesn't

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
four-wheeler or snowmobile it doesn't

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.469 
four-wheeler or snowmobile it doesn't
jerk<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.150> very<00:05:05.360> hard<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:05.979> also<00:05:06.979> if<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.490> go

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
jerk it very hard and also if you go

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.260 
jerk it very hard and also if you go
down<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.690> hillside<00:05:09.199> way<00:05:09.440> there's<00:05:09.710> nothing<00:05:10.270> it

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
down a hillside way there's nothing it

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.850 
down a hillside way there's nothing it
can<00:05:11.419> go<00:05:11.539> around<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:12.320> don't<00:05:12.500> tip<00:05:12.740> the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
can go around so that you don't tip the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.159 
can go around so that you don't tip the
sled<00:05:13.099> over<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.659> thought<00:05:14.659> that<00:05:14.810> was<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:14.990> pretty

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
sled over I thought that was a pretty

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.250 
sled over I thought that was a pretty
good<00:05:15.289> design<00:05:15.680> so<00:05:16.389> if<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:17.570> guys<00:05:17.720> want<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.110> do<00:05:18.229> it

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
good design so if you guys want to do it

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.800 
good design so if you guys want to do it
yourself<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.190> do<00:05:19.880> your<00:05:20.000> own<00:05:20.090> design<00:05:20.389> or<00:05:20.690> you

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
yourself and do your own design or you

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.260 
yourself and do your own design or you
