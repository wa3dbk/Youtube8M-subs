00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
pocketable say a bigger smaller battery

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.639 
pocketable say a bigger smaller battery
so<00:00:50.929> we<00:00:50.960> expected<00:00:51.589> five-hour<00:00:52.070> video<00:00:52.699> use<00:00:53.649> maybe

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
so we expected five-hour video use maybe

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.579 
so we expected five-hour video use maybe
50<00:00:55.190> or<00:00:55.339> even<00:00:55.489> more<00:00:55.820> we're<00:00:56.210> being<00:00:56.440> really<00:00:57.440> nice

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
feeling on the snapping sound we want to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.549 
feeling on the snapping sound we want to
get<00:01:01.190> when<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.519> closed<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:02.289> because<00:01:03.289> this

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
get when it closed is this because this

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.950 
get when it closed is this because this
these<00:01:03.949> are<00:01:04.220> still<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.909> little<00:01:05.330> bit<00:01:05.510> prototype

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
these are still a little bit prototype

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.740 
these are still a little bit prototype
stage<00:01:06.170> because<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:06.800> actually<00:01:07.130> changed

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
stage because they actually changed

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.420 
stage because they actually changed
their<00:01:08.750> features<00:01:09.230> on<00:01:09.380> different<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.370> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
their features on different so now the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.679 
their features on different so now the
mouse<00:01:10.990> mouse<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:13.369> optical<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
mouse mouse is optical and it's on the

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.020 
mouse mouse is optical and it's on the
side<00:01:14.899> here<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.530> gives<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.130> better<00:01:16.369> mobile

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
side here so gives you better mobile

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.660 
side here so gives you better mobile
access<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:18.170> Mars<00:01:18.409> also<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> mouse<00:01:19.100> buttons

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
access to Mars also the mouse buttons

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.850 
access to Mars also the mouse buttons
they<00:01:19.909> are<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.180> here<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.380> early<00:01:21.649> pictures

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
they are now here so the early pictures

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.550 
they are now here so the early pictures
we<00:01:22.310> saw<00:01:22.340> mouse<00:01:22.880> here<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.869> buttons<00:01:24.229> here<00:01:24.380> but

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
we saw mouse here and buttons here but

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560 
we saw mouse here and buttons here but
they<00:01:24.740> will<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.670> like<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.119> which<00:01:26.360> I

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
they will have it like this which I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.289 
they will have it like this which I
prefer<00:01:26.899> this<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.500> really<00:01:27.710> really<00:01:28.460> easy<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:29.270> to

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
prefer this is really really easy is to

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.590 
prefer this is really really easy is to
use<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.170> key<00:01:30.740> travel<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.250> quite<00:01:31.640> deep<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
use the key travel is quite deep on the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.530 
use the key travel is quite deep on the
keys<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.590> believe<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.369> 2.5<00:01:34.909> millimeter

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
keys so I believe some 2.5 millimeter

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.319 
keys so I believe some 2.5 millimeter
travel<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:36.890> as<00:01:36.920> their<00:01:37.280> plot<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.909> nicely

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
travel but as their plot and nicely

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.980 
travel but as their plot and nicely
nicely<00:01:39.229> done<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:40.159> found<00:01:40.789> really<00:01:41.030> easy<00:01:41.869> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
nicely done I found really easy to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.390 
nicely done I found really easy to
also<00:01:43.990> wild<00:01:44.740> walking<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:45.580> cool<00:01:46.180> features<00:01:46.690> here

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
also wild walking so cool features here

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.650 
also wild walking so cool features here
what<00:01:48.400> we<00:01:48.520> heard<00:01:48.610> yesterday<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.240> actually

there trying to keep the start priced
really<00:01:54.460> low<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.750> hear<00:01:56.080> even<00:01:56.620> prices

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
really low so we hear even prices

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.460 
really low so we hear even prices
starting<00:01:57.760> with<00:01:58.330> number<00:01:58.480> three<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:59.170> three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
starting with number three so three

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.540 
starting with number three so three
ninety<00:01:59.830> nine<00:02:00.420> dollars<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:03.130> model

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
ninety nine dollars and so on that model

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.120 
ninety nine dollars and so on that model
would<00:02:03.910> have<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.180> really<00:02:04.570> small<00:02:04.750> SSD<00:02:05.260> no<00:02:05.410> 3g<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
would have a really small SSD no 3g and

would have a really small SSD no 3g and
no<00:02:06.250> touchscreen<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.450> they<00:02:07.720> will<00:02:07.840> bring

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
no touchscreen so they will bring

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.990 
no touchscreen so they will bring
touchscreen<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.860> no<00:02:09.040> touch<00:02:09.250> fingers<00:02:09.670> but

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
version 1024 x 600 where the low end

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.000 
version 1024 x 600 where the low end
version<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.430> actually<00:04:44.730> 800<00:04:45.300> x<00:04:45.450> 480<00:04:46.050> we<00:04:46.680> have<00:04:46.860> to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
version is actually 800 x 480 we have to

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.670 
version is actually 800 x 480 we have to
learn<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.430> about<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.030> actual<00:04:48.210> things<00:04:48.750> but
