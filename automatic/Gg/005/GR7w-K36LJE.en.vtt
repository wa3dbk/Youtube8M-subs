in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> case<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> guys<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.150> we

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
in the case as well so you guys see we

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.490 
in the case as well so you guys see we
just<00:01:39.390> simply<00:01:39.689> putting<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> button<00:01:40.290> side

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
just simply putting the button side

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
just simply putting the button side
first<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.220> snap<00:01:41.430> inside<00:01:41.939> here

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
first and then just snap inside here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
first and then just snap inside here
really<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.720> difficult<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
really not too difficult so we have a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
really not too difficult so we have a
bit<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> lay<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> table<00:01:45.390> design<00:01:45.960> here

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bit of the lay on the table design here

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.359 
bit of the lay on the table design here
which<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.530> obviously<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> stop<00:01:47.250> your

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
which is obviously going to stop your

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.980 
which is obviously going to stop your
screen<00:01:47.729> from<00:01:47.880> getting<00:01:48.119> scratched<00:01:48.360> when

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
screen from getting scratched when

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
screen from getting scratched when
you're<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> drop<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.770> your<00:01:49.890> table<00:01:50.040> or

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you're going to drop it on your table or

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
you're going to drop it on your table or
anything<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.780> solitary<00:01:52.200> have

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
anything like that the solitary have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
anything like that the solitary have
come<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> volume<00:01:53.070> buttons<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
out for our the camera and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.490 
out for our the camera and
I've<00:02:12.849> had<00:02:12.970> no<00:02:13.180> problems<00:02:13.209> with<00:02:13.660> flash<00:02:14.050> washing

I've had no problems with flash washing
outlets<00:02:14.800> also<00:02:15.190> that's<00:02:15.910> definitely<00:02:16.209> really

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
outlets also that's definitely really

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.839 
outlets also that's definitely really
good<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> couple<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.099> cons<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.640> case

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
good so a couple of cons of the case

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.370 
good so a couple of cons of the case
first<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.270> all<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> top<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.870> bottom<00:02:20.020> here<00:02:20.349> you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
first of all the top and bottom here you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.710 
first of all the top and bottom here you
guys<00:02:20.530> see<00:02:20.770> they<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.250> covered<00:02:21.610> at<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.849> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
guys see they are not covered at all and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
guys see they are not covered at all and
also<00:02:22.959> if<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.590> drop<00:02:23.860> them<00:02:24.099> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> top<00:02:25.030> or

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
also if you do drop them on the top or

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.729 
also if you do drop them on the top or
bottom<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.780> catch<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.170> corner<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> desk

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
bottom so you catch a corner of a desk

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.140 
bottom so you catch a corner of a desk
or<00:02:26.920> something<00:02:27.130> like<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.250> then<00:02:27.819> you're<00:02:28.060> going

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
or something like that then you're going

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.640 
or something like that then you're going
to<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.330> looking<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> new<00:02:28.810> iPhone<00:02:29.230> because

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
to be looking for a new iPhone because

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.370 
to be looking for a new iPhone because
the<00:02:30.250> corners<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:31.090> kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.569> cover<00:02:31.840> up<00:02:32.050> half<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
the corners do kind of cover up half of

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.050 
the corners do kind of cover up half of
the<00:02:32.470> corner<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.520> guys<00:02:33.640> see<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.819> there

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the corner but you guys see that there

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.870 
the corner but you guys see that there
doesn't<00:02:34.270> cover<00:02:34.600> up<00:02:34.720> quite<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.050> top<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:36.790> you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
doesn't cover up quite the top so if you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.430 
doesn't cover up quite the top so if you
do<00:02:37.030> drop<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.360> on<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> table<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.290> going

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
do drop this on a table then it's going

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.620 
do drop this on a table then it's going
to<00:02:38.530> stress<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.220> smash<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> screen<00:02:40.000> if

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
to stress you know smash the screen if

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.910 
to stress you know smash the screen if
you<00:02:40.720> do<00:02:40.870> drop<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> top<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.500> bottoms

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
you do drop it on the top of bottoms

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.620 
you do drop it on the top of bottoms
that's<00:02:42.099> definitely<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.550> big<00:02:42.819> con<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.390> case

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
that's definitely a big con of this case

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.990 
that's definitely a big con of this case
perhaps<00:02:44.050> if<00:02:44.319> they<00:02:44.440> bring<00:02:44.680> out<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.860> version<00:02:45.730> two

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
perhaps if they bring out a version two

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.610 
perhaps if they bring out a version two
and<00:02:46.300> that's<00:02:46.870> something<00:02:47.080> they<00:02:47.319> could<00:02:47.500> update

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
and that's something they could update

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.130 
and that's something they could update
in<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.700> guys<00:02:48.880> see<00:02:49.090> very<00:02:49.420> simplistic<00:02:49.900> style

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
in so you guys see very simplistic style

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.600 
in so you guys see very simplistic style
kind<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.470> goes<00:02:50.650> along<00:02:50.799> with<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.160> shape<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
kind of goes along with the shape of the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.809 
kind of goes along with the shape of the
iphone<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.150> very<00:02:52.690> nice<00:02:52.870> minimal<00:02:53.739> bulk<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
iphone a very nice minimal bulk you

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.270 
iphone a very nice minimal bulk you
don't<00:02:55.330> really<00:02:55.450> realize<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.769> cases<00:02:57.130> on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
don't really realize that the cases on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280 
don't really realize that the cases on
the<00:02:57.310> phone<00:02:57.549> at<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.269> does<00:02:58.510> still<00:02:58.780> block<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the phone at all it does still block the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.070 
the phone at all it does still block the
or<00:02:59.739> prevent<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> antenna<00:03:01.239> issue<00:03:01.450> which<00:03:01.959> is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
or prevent the antenna issue which is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.390 
or prevent the antenna issue which is
great<00:03:02.319> because<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.680> lot<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:02.890> people<00:03:02.980> have<00:03:03.250> have

great because a lot of people have have

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
possible but when the case is going to

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.699 
possible but when the case is going to
go<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.280> 29<00:03:18.640> 99<00:03:19.150> at<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.109> moment<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.500> probably

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
go up to 29 99 at the moment I probably

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.830
