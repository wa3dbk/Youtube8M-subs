00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.570 
now I'm just taking the tail in three
sections<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.770> teasing<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.070> natural

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
sections and teasing it with a natural

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180 
sections and teasing it with a natural
bristle<00:02:18.940> brush<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:20.410> reason<00:02:20.740> I'm<00:02:20.830> picking

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
bristle brush and the reason I'm picking

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.340 
bristle brush and the reason I'm picking
the<00:02:21.220> natural<00:02:21.760> bristle<00:02:22.209> brush<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.990> because

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
the natural bristle brush is because

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.780 
the natural bristle brush is because
it's<00:02:23.530> going<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.860> tease<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.190> hair<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> little
