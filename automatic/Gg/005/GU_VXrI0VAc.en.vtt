00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 welcome to the Kulturhof 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.630
 Graffiti only in the shop 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.910
 we have to be ours 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.580
 give introduction and have a few 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.260
 examples the time rather die 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.480
 advanced training courses 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 Philipp lame then next time that 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 most important that I come up with names 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.810
 the partnership 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.130
 the foreground of course is the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.809
 artistic aspect of us soil to man 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.270
 characterized may also be expressed is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.570
 important to convey what graffiti everything 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.090
 in the city or in society 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.730
 Everything has already reached and the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:24.120
 illegality size only comes from well 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.120
 and my tip at the same city 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.940
 yes then we went out and have 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 our canvas primed 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.080
 you're 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.440
 then sketched and after with graffiti 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.440
 penciled out 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.370
 Yes 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.540
 sunday and we say if possible 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.400
 spray with the medium 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.170
 understand her minus 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.390
 then we too have our sketches 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.500
 played out and watched how to do that on 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.500
 best bearing on it 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.950
 music is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.950
 whether the area 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.100
 we will also be working on it 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.800
 exhibiting a population 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.420
 that means I 'm already going too 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.350
 with the first workshop directly the 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.250
 possibility your works then also 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.250
 to present a small audience 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.139
 3 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.459
 b 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.810
 Yes 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.050
 good is 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.780
 So I especially liked that 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.810
 martin and manuel and so good at helping 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.060
 best I liked that with at the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.990
 Wall take me where I take in any case 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.370
 that's not too easy and you 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.600
 just have to lubricate something 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.870
 but that's already work too 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.280
 the graffiti keeps effort to bring me 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.500
 actually learned everything 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.290
 I could already do a few 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.979
 However , I have written notes 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.840
 generally learned everything new because I have 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.700
 never so possible right with it 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.740
 So I'll work on everyone 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.600
 carry case, I'm so 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.600
 Closed because it is really fun 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.900
 do 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.400
 lied
