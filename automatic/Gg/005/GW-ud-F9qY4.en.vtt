NAT<00:01:55.460> cosmos<00:01:56.759> yeah<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
NAT cosmos yeah and that really that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
NAT cosmos yeah and that really that
mean<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.159> an<00:01:59.310> email<00:01:59.759> style

mean I would have to be an email style

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.850 
mean I would have to be an email style
yeah<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> older<00:02:00.990> reference<00:02:01.409> lost<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
yeah it was the older reference lost I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
yeah it was the older reference lost I
think<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.220> many<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.640> walk<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> nothing

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
think of many of you walk it to nothing

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.649 
think of many of you walk it to nothing
I'm<00:02:04.320> time<00:02:04.619> s<00:02:04.829> look<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.340> me<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.119> used<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.539> be

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
I'm time s look at me just I used to be

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.979 
I'm time s look at me just I used to be
tall<00:02:06.899> are<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.399> council<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.360> first

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
tall are you with the council I first

tall are you with the council I first
met<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.289> guy<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.950> board<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> plan<00:02:11.640> 30

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
met this guy on the board of the plan 30

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.040 
met this guy on the board of the plan 30
1997<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.500> believe<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.340> little<00:02:14.790> uh<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.900> my

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
1997 I believe with that little uh so my

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.960 
1997 I believe with that little uh so my
predecessor<00:02:16.709> Lew<00:02:16.830> Friedman<00:02:17.340> asked<00:02:17.670> me<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.849> be

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
predecessor Lew Friedman asked me to be

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.020 
predecessor Lew Friedman asked me to be
on<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> board<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.450> was<00:02:18.569> quite<00:02:19.400> choked<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.610> taken

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
on the board I was quite choked up taken

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
on the board I was quite choked up taken
aback<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.599> then<00:02:21.750> shortly<00:02:22.200> thereafter<00:02:22.500> he

aback and then shortly thereafter he

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
aback and then shortly thereafter he
asks<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> boundary<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:25.230> cross

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
asks you to be on the boundary we cross

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.830 
asks you to be on the boundary we cross
paths<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.160> we've<00:02:26.340> become<00:02:26.549> best<00:02:26.970> friends

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
explore space if in our lifetime we

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.920 
explore space if in our lifetime we
could<00:02:35.190> find<00:02:35.489> evidence<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.150> life<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.630> another

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
could find evidence of life on another

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.009 
could find evidence of life on another
world<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:38.280> two<00:02:38.459> logical<00:02:38.670> places<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.450> look<00:02:39.630> are

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
world the two logical places to look are

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.589 
world the two logical places to look are
the<00:02:40.230> planet<00:02:40.560> Mars<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:42.180> moon<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
the planet Mars and then this moon of

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.750 
the planet Mars and then this moon of
Jupiter<00:02:43.080> Europa<00:02:43.349> I'm<00:02:43.830> with<00:02:44.010> him<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.430> if

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
Jupiter Europa I'm with him on that if

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.309 
Jupiter Europa I'm with him on that if
that<00:02:45.030> were<00:02:45.180> discovered<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:45.959> change<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
that were discovered it would change the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.440 
that were discovered it would change the
course<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.739> human<00:02:46.950> history<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.849> biologists

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
course of human history what biologists

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
course of human history what biologists
would<00:02:48.540> finally<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:48.959> another<00:02:49.620> example<00:02:50.220> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
would finally have another example of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.339 
would finally have another example of
life<00:02:50.580> rather<00:02:51.269> than<00:02:51.420> pretending<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.230> they

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
life rather than pretending that they

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.740 
life rather than pretending that they
have<00:02:52.500> actual<00:02:53.030> biodiversity<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.599> earth

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
have actual biodiversity here on earth

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.839 
have actual biodiversity here on earth
when<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.349> life<00:02:55.380> they've<00:02:55.799> ever<00:02:55.920> studied<00:02:56.430> has

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
when all life they've ever studied has

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.050 
when all life they've ever studied has
DNA<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.049> common<00:02:58.440> with<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.220> another<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.790> like

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
DNA in common with one another just like

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.880 
DNA in common with one another just like
need<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.630> liquid<00:03:01.019> water<00:03:01.049> just<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.709> at

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
need with liquid water just like at

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
need with liquid water just like at
metabolism<00:03:02.579> does<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.000> need<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.900> a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
metabolism does like need this it's a

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.069 
metabolism does like need this it's a
virus<00:03:04.650> alive<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.400> crystal<00:03:06.269> alive<00:03:06.630> they're

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
virus alive is crystal alive they're

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.509 
virus alive is crystal alive they're
asking<00:03:07.260> these<00:03:07.590> questions<00:03:07.739> because<00:03:08.310> they

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
asking these questions because they

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.789 
asking these questions because they
don't<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.760> seven<00:03:09.150> examples<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.840> life<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.500> if

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
don't have seven examples of life so if

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.020 
don't have seven examples of life so if
you<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.010> two<00:03:11.100> working<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.549> talking<00:03:11.880> if

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
you have two working out I'm talking if

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.789 
you have two working out I'm talking if
you<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.299> seven<00:03:12.690> examples<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.319> life<00:03:13.470> you

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
you have seven examples of life you

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.960 
you have seven examples of life you
could<00:03:13.950> say<00:03:14.040> here's<00:03:14.400> what<00:03:14.549> they<00:03:14.640> all<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:14.940> in

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
could say here's what they all have in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.880 
could say here's what they all have in
common<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.230> side<00:03:16.410> uses<00:03:16.709> liquid

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
common then this side uses liquid

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710 
common then this side uses liquid
methane<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.700> use<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.030> liquid<00:03:18.150> water<00:03:18.390> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
methane the use of liquid water so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.479 
methane the use of liquid water so
liquid<00:03:18.900> water<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.319> not<00:03:19.440> important<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.370> just

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
liquid water is not important it's just

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.610 
liquid water is not important it's just
that<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> liquid<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.390> what<00:03:21.720> if<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.350> all

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that it has a liquid or what if they all

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.250 
that it has a liquid or what if they all
have<00:03:23.100> liquid<00:03:23.549> then<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.269> got<00:03:24.450> good<00:03:24.840> argument

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
have liquid then you got good argument

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.720 
have liquid then you got good argument
if<00:03:25.319> they<00:03:25.410> all<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.650> DNA<00:03:25.829> now<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.519> talk

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
if they all have DNA now you can talk

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.069 
if they all have DNA now you can talk
about<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.090> life<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> was<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
about what life is it was not the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.090 
about what life is it was not the
question<00:03:28.230> that's<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:28.709> I'm<00:03:28.769> saying

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
question that's all I'm saying

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.099 
question that's all I'm saying
we<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.609> done<00:03:29.790> an<00:03:29.910> analysis<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.630> seems<00:03:30.840> quite

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
we have done an analysis and seems quite

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.009 
we have done an analysis and seems quite

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
reasonable that just keeping the NASA

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.710 
reasonable that just keeping the NASA
funding<00:03:34.769> just<00:03:35.340> growing<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.030> inflation<00:03:36.420> we

funding just growing with inflation we
could<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:37.109> humans<00:03:37.590> orbiting<00:03:38.100> Mars<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.700> 2033

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
could have humans orbiting Mars in 2033

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.319 
could have humans orbiting Mars in 2033
I<00:03:39.900> will<00:03:40.260> add<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:41.130> whoever<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.639> orbiting<00:03:42.120> Mars

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
I will add that whoever is orbiting Mars

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.860 
I will add that whoever is orbiting Mars
in<00:03:42.540> 2033<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.280> middle<00:03:44.609> school<00:03:44.910> today<00:03:45.120> that's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
in 2033 is in middle school today that's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.640 
in 2033 is in middle school today that's
pretty<00:03:46.170> cool

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
pretty cool

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.800 
pretty cool
working<00:03:47.130> together<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.730> claim<00:03:48.239> we<00:03:48.269> can

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
working together I claim we can

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.140 
working together I claim we can
guarantee<00:03:49.760> change<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.090> world

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.650 

good
