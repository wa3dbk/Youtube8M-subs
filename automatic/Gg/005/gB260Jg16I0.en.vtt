00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
working on the other side so I decided

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
working on the other side so I decided
to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.260> chunky<00:00:34.469> braids<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.309> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to do for chunky braids so I'm just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
to do for chunky braids so I'm just
going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.760> section<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.899> hair<00:00:37.079> spritz<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
going to section off my hair spritz a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
going to section off my hair spritz a
little<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> water<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.879> because<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> did

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
little bit of water in it because it did

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
little bit of water in it because it did
get<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:39.809> dry<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> make

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
get a little dry and you want to make

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
get a little dry and you want to make
sure<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.040> hair<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.280> nice<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> damp<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sure your hair is nice and damp so you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.889 
sure your hair is nice and damp so you
can<00:00:42.989> detangle<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.530> easier<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> olive

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
can detangle it easier and so the olive

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
can detangle it easier and so the olive
oil<00:00:45.960> eco<00:00:46.320> styler<00:00:46.530> gel<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:47.039> apply<00:00:47.340> very

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
oil eco styler gel can apply very

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
oil eco styler gel can apply very
smoothly

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.550 

so<00:00:51.150> now<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.450> time<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.630> some<00:00:51.930> eco<00:00:52.260> styler<00:00:52.470> gel

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
so now it's time for some eco styler gel

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.530 
so now it's time for some eco styler gel
which<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.950> thebomb.com<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.240> I'm<00:00:54.330> going<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
which is thebomb.com and I'm going to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.180 
which is thebomb.com and I'm going to
apply<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:54.900> over<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.410> hair<00:00:55.770> especially

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
apply that all over my hair especially

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
apply that all over my hair especially
focusing<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.240> my<00:00:57.390> edges<00:00:57.720> because<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.110> just

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
focusing on my edges because it just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.230 
focusing on my edges because it just
really<00:00:58.440> lays<00:00:58.680> all<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> fly<00:00:59.370> rings<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
really lays all the fly rings down and

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.900 
really lays all the fly rings down and
then<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.500> clumps<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.310> eco<00:01:02.700> styler

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
then I just take clumps of eco styler

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
then I just take clumps of eco styler
gel<00:01:03.000> until<00:01:03.540> my<00:01:03.690> hair<00:01:03.930> feels<00:01:04.620> really<00:01:04.920> smooth

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gel until my hair feels really smooth

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160 
gel until my hair feels really smooth
and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.880> how<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:07.020> it's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and then that's how you know when it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.969 
and then that's how you know when it's
time<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.410> start<00:01:07.830> braiding<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.300> just<00:01:09.540> gonna

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
time to start braiding so I'm just gonna

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.620 
time to start braiding so I'm just gonna
get<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.130> edges<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.479> I'm

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.880 

so<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:35.780> want<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.050> make<00:01:36.170> sure<00:01:36.290> your<00:01:36.440> hair<00:01:36.680> is

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
damp all the way through as well as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.470 
damp all the way through as well as
there<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.560> no<00:01:39.800> tangles<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.430> got<00:01:41.030> some<00:01:41.210> tangles

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
there are no tangles so got some tangles

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.210 
there are no tangles so got some tangles
you<00:01:41.750> want<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.020> brush<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.380> out<00:01:42.470> or<00:01:42.740> comb<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.100> out

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
you want to brush it out or comb it out

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.060

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and then continue to braid and when you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.200 
and then continue to braid and when you
get<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.400> end<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:46.670> definitely<00:01:47.060> wanna<00:01:47.180> make

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
get to the end you definitely wanna make

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.180 
get to the end you definitely wanna make

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
sure that it's nice and smooth so you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.730 
sure that it's nice and smooth so you
can<00:01:49.430> have<00:01:49.640> perfect<00:01:50.300> ends<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.440> it's<00:01:51.590> not

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
can have perfect ends and so it's not
