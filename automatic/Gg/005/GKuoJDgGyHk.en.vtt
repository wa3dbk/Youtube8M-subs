00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
first I thought it was just some

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.150 
first I thought it was just some
officers<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.349> were<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.590> out<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.799> control

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
officers that were just out of control

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.970 
officers that were just out of control

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
but then the sheriff stated like for the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.589 
but then the sheriff stated like for the
record<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.579> know<00:04:03.670> we<00:04:04.000> had<00:04:04.180> some<00:04:04.359> kind<00:04:04.510> of

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
record that you know we had some kind of

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.289 
record that you know we had some kind of
agenda<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.310> then<00:04:06.430> backed<00:04:06.670> his<00:04:06.849> officers

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
agenda and and then backed his officers

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.610 
agenda and and then backed his officers

so that that shows me a little bit of

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.759
