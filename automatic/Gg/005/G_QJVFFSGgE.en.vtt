00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
except for one thing you're gonna hear

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.770 
except for one thing you're gonna hear
the<00:01:29.440> same<00:01:29.740> five<00:01:30.040> lines<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.610> billion<00:01:31.060> times<00:01:31.360> in

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
the same five lines a billion times in

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.580 
the same five lines a billion times in
fact

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
fact

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.530 
fact
oddly<00:01:32.830> enough<00:01:33.040> pandemic<00:01:33.850> didn't<00:01:34.120> write<00:01:34.300> very

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
oddly enough pandemic didn't write very

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.660 
oddly enough pandemic didn't write very
many<00:01:34.780> lines<00:01:35.170> for<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.560> NPC's<00:01:36.070> but<00:01:36.430> they<00:01:36.520> had

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
many lines for the NPC's but they had

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.610 
many lines for the NPC's but they had
different<00:01:36.970> people<00:01:37.240> record<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.050> same<00:01:38.320> lines

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
different people record the same lines

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.890 
different people record the same lines
so<00:01:39.310> while<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.880> hear<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.150> same<00:01:40.390> five<00:01:40.600> lines

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
so while you hear the same five lines

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.570 
so while you hear the same five lines
again<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.320> again<00:01:41.650> you're<00:01:42.130> gonna<00:01:42.250> hear<00:01:42.430> them

for different voices the story is your

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.200 
for different voices the story is your
typical<00:01:44.650> revenge<00:01:45.340> because<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.700> got<00:01:45.850> shot<00:01:45.880> in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
typical revenge because you got shot in

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.610 
typical revenge because you got shot in
the<00:01:46.300> ass<00:01:46.420> plot<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.350> it's<00:01:47.470> nothing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
the ass plot so it's nothing

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.350 
the ass plot so it's nothing
particularly<00:01:48.160> great<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.910> does<00:01:49.090> get<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
particularly great it does get the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.450 
particularly great it does get the
action<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:49.810> explosions<00:01:50.320> moving<00:01:50.680> now<00:01:50.800> the

action in explosions moving now the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.100 
action in explosions moving now the
biggest<00:01:51.670> problem<00:01:52.060> with<00:01:52.120> mercenaries<00:01:52.479> too<00:01:52.870> is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
biggest problem with mercenaries too is

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.510 
biggest problem with mercenaries too is
that<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.440> game<00:01:53.590> just<00:01:53.710> doesn't<00:01:53.860> have<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.340> kind

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
that the game just doesn't have the kind

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.370 
that the game just doesn't have the kind
of<00:01:54.580> polish<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.120> would<00:01:55.150> want<00:01:55.450> from<00:01:55.690> something

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
of polish you would want from something

feet<00:02:08.649> sometimes<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.910> weirdest<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.420> all

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
feet sometimes the weirdest one of all

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.270 
feet sometimes the weirdest one of all
is<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:10.989> you're<00:02:11.110> driving<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.530> tank<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.190> can

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
is that if you're driving a tank you can

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.310 
is that if you're driving a tank you can
actually<00:02:12.430> smash<00:02:12.880> through<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.270> car<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> explode

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
actually smash through a car and explode

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.500 
actually smash through a car and explode
it<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.620> take<00:02:14.739> no<00:02:14.950> damage<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:15.550> bump<00:02:16.180> into<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it and take no damage but bump into a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
it and take no damage but bump into a
fire<00:02:16.750> hydrant<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.530> actually<00:02:17.890> take

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
fire hydrant and you actually take

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.729 
fire hydrant and you actually take
damage<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.730> tank<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.300> know<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.500> there's

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
damage to your tank I know that there's

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.080 
damage to your tank I know that there's
a<00:02:20.830> lot<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.980> strategy<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.580> there<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.000> people

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a lot of strategy out there for people

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
a lot of strategy out there for people
putting<00:02:22.510> fire<00:02:22.690> hardness<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.200> way<00:02:23.350> of

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
putting fire hardness in the way of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.410 
putting fire hardness in the way of
tanks<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.830> destroy<00:02:24.160> them<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.209> doesn't

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
tanks to destroy them but it doesn't

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.490 
tanks to destroy them but it doesn't
seem<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.810> something<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.200> actually

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
seem like something you would actually

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.320 
seem like something you would actually
want<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.010> video<00:02:27.250> game<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.880> although<00:02:28.090> there

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
want in a video game and although there

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
that there is dropping and drop out

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.160 
that there is dropping and drop out
online<00:02:32.890> co-op<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.060> two<00:02:34.239> people<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
online co-op for up the two people the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.780 
online co-op for up the two people the
game's<00:02:35.380> difficulty<00:02:35.739> doesn't<00:02:36.130> scale<00:02:36.549> when<00:02:36.730> you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
game's difficulty doesn't scale when you

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550 
game's difficulty doesn't scale when you
add<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> buddy<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> mix<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.260> more

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
