00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
how to draw in this clip I'm going to

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.970 
how to draw in this clip I'm going to
show<00:00:09.099> you<00:00:09.340> how<00:00:09.730> to<00:00:09.790> draw<00:00:10.420> a<00:00:10.660> bay<00:00:10.900> window<00:00:11.259> and

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
show you how to draw a bay window and

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.310 
show you how to draw a bay window and
we're<00:00:12.759> gonna<00:00:12.849> start<00:00:13.179> off<00:00:13.420> with<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:13.750> rectangular

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
we're gonna start off with a rectangular

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.280 
we're gonna start off with a rectangular
shape<00:00:14.740> which<00:00:15.129> would<00:00:15.309> be<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.549> center<00:00:15.879> window

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
shape which would be the center window

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.030 
shape which would be the center window
because<00:00:17.290> we're<00:00:17.440> going<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.620> be<00:00:17.680> looking<00:00:17.950> at

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
because we're going to be looking at

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.640 
because we're going to be looking at
this<00:00:18.160> window<00:00:18.550> straight<00:00:18.910> on<00:00:19.120> so<00:00:20.110> I'm<00:00:20.230> sure<00:00:20.440> I'm

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
this window straight on so I'm sure I'm

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.340 
this window straight on so I'm sure I'm
drawing<00:00:21.040> a<00:00:21.130> nice<00:00:21.370> rectangle<00:00:22.180> like<00:00:22.360> that<00:00:22.600> and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
drawing a nice rectangle like that and

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.470 
drawing a nice rectangle like that and
then<00:00:23.950> we're<00:00:24.130> gonna<00:00:24.220> have<00:00:24.430> two<00:00:24.670> side<00:00:24.970> windows

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
then we're gonna have two side windows

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.770 
then we're gonna have two side windows
that<00:00:25.720> are<00:00:25.780> sort<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.170> coming<00:00:27.040> in<00:00:27.270> coming<00:00:28.270> out<00:00:28.570> to

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
that are sort of coming in coming out to

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.300 
that are sort of coming in coming out to
us<00:00:28.930> so<00:00:29.170> we're<00:00:29.290> gonna<00:00:29.380> draw<00:00:29.650> an<00:00:29.800> angle<00:00:29.980> like

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
us so we're gonna draw an angle like

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.790 
us so we're gonna draw an angle like
this<00:00:30.370> down<00:00:31.180> on<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.360> bottom<00:00:31.540> here<00:00:31.990> and<00:00:32.470> we'll

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
this down on the bottom here and we'll

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.220 
this down on the bottom here and we'll
do<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.040> opposing<00:00:33.550> angle<00:00:33.910> over<00:00:34.150> here<00:00:34.510> on<00:00:35.020> this

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
do the opposing angle over here on this

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.100 
do the opposing angle over here on this
side<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.880> vertically<00:00:37.540> because<00:00:37.900> we're<00:00:38.020> gonna

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
side now vertically because we're gonna

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.570 
side now vertically because we're gonna
be<00:00:38.260> looking<00:00:38.350> straight<00:00:38.620> out<00:00:38.800> on<00:00:39.100> this<00:00:39.220> window

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
be looking straight out on this window

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.760 
be looking straight out on this window
on<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.330> top<00:00:40.540> we're<00:00:40.750> gonna<00:00:40.810> have<00:00:41.140> lines<00:00:41.440> like

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
on the top we're gonna have lines like

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.040 
on the top we're gonna have lines like
this<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:44.220> then<00:00:45.220> when<00:00:45.490> we<00:00:45.670> close<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.690> off<00:00:46.840> like

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
this and then when we close it off like

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.370 
this and then when we close it off like
this<00:00:47.079> and<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:52.900> almost<00:00:53.140> looks

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
this and this and this it almost looks

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.760 
this and this and this it almost looks
like<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.530> tunnel<00:00:54.040> effect<00:00:54.160> here<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:56.410> I'm<00:00:56.620> going

walls just to sort of close them in and
I<00:02:03.520> use<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.939> charcoal<00:02:04.420> on<00:02:04.689> this<00:02:04.900> because<00:02:05.619> it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
I use the charcoal on this because it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.590 
I use the charcoal on this because it
covers<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.130> lot<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.340> ground<00:02:06.460> really<00:02:06.970> nice<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
covers a lot of ground really nice and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.090 
covers a lot of ground really nice and
fast<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.139> we<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.229> able

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
fast and we can able

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.640 
fast and we can able
to<00:02:09.640> put<00:02:09.880> some<00:02:10.090> nice<00:02:10.360> value<00:02:10.930> in<00:02:11.110> there<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.500> give

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
to put some nice value in there to give

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.510 
to put some nice value in there to give
it<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.800> surface<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.620> had<00:02:14.770> more<00:02:14.980> time<00:02:15.040> we

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
it a surface and if we had more time we

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.220 
it a surface and if we had more time we
can<00:02:15.670> make<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.030> real<00:02:16.360> nice<00:02:16.690> finished

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
can make this a real nice finished

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.280 
can make this a real nice finished
effect<00:02:18.360> darkening<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.660> these<00:02:19.750> surfaces

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
effect darkening some of these surfaces

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.990 
effect darkening some of these surfaces
in<00:02:20.440> here<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:21.280> give<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.550> some<00:02:21.730> depth<00:02:27.000> little

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
in here to give it some depth little

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610 
in here to give it some depth little
lines<00:02:28.210> like<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.690> give<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> feeling<00:02:29.350> that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
lines like this give the feeling that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.000 
lines like this give the feeling that
it's<00:02:29.740> glass<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:31.300> there<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.260> bay

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's glass and there we have a bay

it's glass and there we have a bay
