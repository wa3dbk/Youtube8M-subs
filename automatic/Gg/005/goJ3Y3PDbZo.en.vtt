on<00:03:36.920> his<00:03:37.280> head<00:03:37.519> actually<00:03:38.420> think<00:03:38.750> that's<00:03:38.840> kind

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
on his head actually think that's kind

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.110 
on his head actually think that's kind
of<00:03:39.140> cool<00:03:39.290> looking<00:03:39.440> then<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.430> piece<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.940> his

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
of cool looking then this piece of his

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.710 
of cool looking then this piece of his
tail<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.870> guess<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.170> could<00:03:42.290> call<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:42.470> comes<00:03:42.739> off

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720

tail I guess you could call it comes off
it<00:03:44.720> snaps<00:03:45.079> into<00:03:45.290> his<00:03:45.530> head<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:46.420> then<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.660> think

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it snaps into his head and then I think

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.690 
it snaps into his head and then I think
