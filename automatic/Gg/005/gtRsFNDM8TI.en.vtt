like pushing along her like little
reassurance<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> everything's<00:01:38.430> okay<00:01:38.549> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
reassurance that everything's okay like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
reassurance that everything's okay like
she's<00:01:39.720> looking<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.110> mirror<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> seeing<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
she's looking in the mirror and seeing a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.440 
she's looking in the mirror and seeing a
couple<00:01:40.979> extra<00:01:41.250> pounds<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.640> show<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.390> she

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
couple extra pounds to show that she

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
couple extra pounds to show that she
gained<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.890> I'm

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
gained back all the way that's what I'm

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
gained back all the way that's what I'm
thinking<00:01:44.369> maybe<00:01:44.520> she's<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:44.970> fully<00:01:45.180> aware

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
thinking maybe she's not fully aware

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.670 
thinking maybe she's not fully aware
that<00:01:45.450> later<00:01:45.930> she<00:01:46.170> probably<00:01:46.380> doesn't<00:01:46.590> even

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that later she probably doesn't even

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.429 
that later she probably doesn't even
aware<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.170> saw
