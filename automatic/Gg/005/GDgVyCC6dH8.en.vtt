00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
it was already dark but a bit of

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.369 
it was already dark but a bit of
reflection<00:01:03.640> from<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.239> ice<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:05.170> thing

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
reflection from the ice and this thing

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.530 
reflection from the ice and this thing
was<00:01:05.530> amazing<00:01:05.979> this<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.220> huge<00:01:06.550> but<00:01:06.850> they<00:01:07.300> hadn't

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
was amazing this is huge but they hadn't

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.350 
was amazing this is huge but they hadn't
got<00:01:07.660> lights<00:01:07.869> inside<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.500> yet<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.729> I'm<00:01:10.180> actually

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
got lights inside it yet so I'm actually

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.120 
got lights inside it yet so I'm actually
gets<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:10.960> video<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.440> outside<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.040> it

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
gets you some video of the outside of it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.070 
gets you some video of the outside of it
you<00:01:12.220> can<00:01:12.369> see<00:01:12.520> okay<00:01:12.850> but<00:01:13.509> we<00:01:13.630> couldn't<00:01:13.869> video

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
you can see okay but we couldn't video

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.230 
you can see okay but we couldn't video
inside<00:01:14.440> because<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.710> was<00:01:14.830> pitch<00:01:15.040> black<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
