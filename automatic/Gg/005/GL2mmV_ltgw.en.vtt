00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.449
 next we want to share the result of some investigations that 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.590
 The section of horticulture of the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.270
 faculty of agricultural sciences on this engineer osvaldo rivers in some 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 considerations about your research 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.920
 in the horticultural section of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 investigations are being developed 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.440
 in horticultural items 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 that allow a greater efficiency in the production 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.140
 the engineer romualdo rivers told us about an investigation that they are 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.080
 taking place in the tomato crop 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.950
 destined to determine 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.910
 the ideal size of the goalkeeper protects them and the number of branches 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.330
 ideal for a better development the tomatoes not of the vegetable more 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.100
 consumed in our country 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.220
 and that deserves moon specialized tension 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.800
 in the list not of the diverse type of investigations 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.160
 We are in full harvest of the research plot 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.660
 where emc you have 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.170
 she 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.980
 the outbreaks the to the extent of what he protested 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.210
 what is being done 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.310
 and there is a tendency when the outbreaks e is done from zero to 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 p centimeters long 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.109
 i up to five centimeters long 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.109
 plus the check that already begins 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 estrada both mokhtar c what side the fruits are 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.660
 pd the smaller one 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.440
 reads lower quality 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.740
 why this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.970
 still without having a definitive result yet 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.830
 we can advance that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.429
 the small buds 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.619
 it turns out much better 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.249
 the one for the best production 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:18.079
 here we can keep tomato level of type 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.609
 this is the 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.370
 quality 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.599
 pinky of good development 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.929
 is when you harvest this box when it is cut 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.059
 sprouts 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.659
 to that size 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.159
 dv up to five felt metro 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.739
 of length 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.199
 We are also testing listed for one hundred spills that can stay 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:46.789
 and we have found that driving them leaves only one branch the fruits are 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.489
 they develop much better 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.059
 and those that do not let 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:55.259
 percent be cut michael do not know have already debuted 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.680
 produces a lot more in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.029
 amount of fruit but small 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.679
 practically non-tradable 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:09.529
 maybe he is important for this cluster to alizar 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.269
 but for fresh consumption 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.379
 henson too small 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.249
 this research plot 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.669
 is having optimal results 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.749
 and as a result of these investigations the professional already advanced 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.950
 some specific issues that are important to keep in mind 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.309
 healey of this investigation 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.850
 can you recommend what cd 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.779
 of g 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.839
 1 today two branches only for plant 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.269
 it will develop 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.330
 the fruits 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.179
 this percent as usual 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:52.419
 by this when you leave a single branch you can reach up to eight to nine chub 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.719
 and if it is left to two, it should only be left 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.450
 for each lama sheikh cacho 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.079
 total then 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.819
 12 chub by me 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.579
 plant 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.509
 and this would be 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:10.959
 pepe sand or around 8 pd to 9 kilos 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.020
 the professional also spoke 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.320
 of the care that this plot has received in the whole phase of the crop 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.950
 the relevant rusty p 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.860
 with 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.379
 diego drip 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:26.889
 fertilization 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.789
 of this bird stable 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.900
 without that of nitrogen 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.789
 so I did hua the also foreseeing 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.580
 the attack of pests and diseases 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.990
 i this in the greenhouse there is less 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.879
 attack 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.960
 i therefore the plants do not need 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.729
 pd of the plant cover is not to say that in the application 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.009
 pd chemical product 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.400
 for this one this afternoon diseases my plan
