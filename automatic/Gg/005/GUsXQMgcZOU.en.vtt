 hello greetings to all welcome once 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.000
 more to a new trial video estÃ¡vez trata 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.730
 about an application for users 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 one device having android 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 application that is called apac software 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.109
 cable that is available in google 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.349
 play as you can appreciate so 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.630
 Free surely more than one will 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.269
 It will be very interesting this 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.970
 application what it does is that you can 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.860
 synchronize or through it you can 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.949
 transfer all the files either 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 music and makes videos either images and 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.460
 makes applications a pica from your 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 Android system or from your device 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 Android simply with the condition of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 that the computer and your device 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.360
 Android must be in the same connection 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.449
 wifi that has to have the same network 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.519
 wifi so it can work and it's very 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.760
 easy and once we download it here 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.369
 as you can see through us the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 same device one direction and fight 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.370
 play we have to open our 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.370
 browser 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.500
 computer so we can see what 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.020
 file as you can see here in the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 screenshots we can also 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 make the arrangements as if it were a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 file gesture copy paste succeeded 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.950
 from our android device without 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 need to remove the sd card without 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.800
 need to use any cable all this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 via wifi once we download it in 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.940
 our android device we are going to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 our android device i have it 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.890
 already open but in principle we're going to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.100
 get out of here so that you are going to 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.840
 tell him yes we're going out and we're going to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
 applications and applications 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.300
 downloaded as you can see is this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.560
 cable data software we click to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.110
 we open the application and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.700
 and we must click here to synchronize pc 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 here we can also synchronize the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.350
 phone we can invite a friend 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.179
 we can for example see the files that 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.950
 they are on the sd card the good the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.319
 applications that we have installed 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.640
 our android device how can 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.640
 see all the applications here 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.790
 but in principle to synchronize the 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.700
 files we just click on sense 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.040
 synchronize pc and we must here to 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.349
 start the service and here to stop it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
 and from here we can do the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.940
 configurations for example put you 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.590
 name and password here put by 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.959
 example activate what is the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.200
 notification in the notification bar 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 from the same application we can change 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.360
 the numbers does since we can do 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 our share it good our 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.050
 configuration let's go back to back 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.709
 and here to start the service 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.239
 we just click on start service and 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.720
 As you can see, he will show us 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.510
 this ip address which we must 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.160
 create in our browser 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 we will open the browser and what I have 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.440
 already open but we go back and as 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.200
 you can see here we get a directory 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.239
 of all the files that we already have 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.920
 be the same system of our 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.769
 Android device right now 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.840
 folders that we have saved our 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.660
 music from the app downloads 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.910
 is applied 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.640
 and if we want for example the same 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.860
 photos if we want to say if we want 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 transfer this this folder towards 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.070
 our computer we simply put 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.380
 Right click and we say save link 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.200
 how and it will open us directly 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.810
 a window which we can select 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.180
 the folder here I have in my ritu de 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.950
 download but we can for example 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.480
 choose the folder that is saved 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.340
 folder images that this for example 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.850
 we can put the name that this folder 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.550
 is saved in what is the folder that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.260
 it's called images on our computer or 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.410
 we can choose desktop we can 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.290
 choose the documents any folder 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.030
 our the same disk if we want or 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.160
 choose any folder that we have 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 to keep this the same thing happens too 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 the vice versa we can choose let's say if 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.360
 we open our folder simply 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.120
 we choose and drag the same file 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.120
 from or video or image from our 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.940
 computer towards what is our 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.430
 android the truth is very interesting and 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.630
 very easy and very fast we do not need to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.340
 no cable we do not need more 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.280
 nothing that in terms of what is the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.820
 synchronization through this address 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.920
 ip the same the same mobile device 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.340
 also inside we can do more things 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.870
 as you can see here it does not show us the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.470
 space that we have available in 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.620
 our 8gb card but we have 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.800
 viable or we have available a 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.690
 capacity 16 6 gb here for example if 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.130
 let's put our synchronization 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.080
 device here we can use it 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.730
 by a manager as if it were a 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.630
 download manager to which then we 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.360
 allows us to see the files 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.470
 the files that we have on the card 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.470
 sd we can for example 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:16.770
 and copy it paste in another site without 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:19.770
 need to even take out once 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.199
 just keep your finger pressed 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.689
 a few seconds and we can for example 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.929
 open by or we can copy it cut it 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.209
 let's tell them we want to copy it and 

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:34.169
 we look for another folder to which we can 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:36.499
 put say where we want we open it 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.929
 and we just click here to 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:43.020
 paste it and as you can see here it's going to 

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:46.889
 put a bar to indicate what it is 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.449
 that same folder has been transferred to the 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.059
 another folder that May we can 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.099
 also create a new folder with the 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:56.270
 name a new directory or a new one 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.670
 file is as if it were a manager of 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.830
 of files but within our 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.940
 smartphone here also the applications 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.840
 the same bases with the applications 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.660
 we just click and can copy 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.249
 the application to another directory or 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.749
 to another folder 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:14.519
 I hope you like this trial video 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.709
 especially that it is useful for them 

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:19.229
 that can transfer all your files 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:22.139
 from your android to the computer without 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.679
 the need to use the usb cable 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.539
 only via wifi that the computer 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:30.629
 and the device that we're going to 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.789
 synchronize or transfer documents 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:36.359
 files have to be connected to the 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.889
 same wifi network and this is all see you 

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:39.889
 an upcoming video tutorial 

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:47.269
