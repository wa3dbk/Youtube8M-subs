 half-gloomy the actions of the

 company fell for obvious reasons and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.899
 taking advantage of all this relax a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 employee in england posted a letter 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 on the internet about the mistreatment that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.649
 the company has towards the employees and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.199
 consumers and the list of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 philosophy of not touch me ando chido

 granny ace of life because they remember 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 that a few moments ago I told you that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
 Microsoft increased its sales due 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 to the halo game of master kits 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 collection good as it turns out that this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.729
 title came out with a lot of mistakes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 just as Augustine wrote nit and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 since in multiplayer mode you have 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.610
 to wait around 10 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 minutes to connect to the game and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 many game modes do not work 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 before this obviously apologized 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.649
 and that they are going to close the modes that are not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 work and that possibly they are going to 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.960
 fix they do not know when but they 're going to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.570
 straight 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 the president of playstation america 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.899
 He said he heard the prayers of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
 the users and that if it is in their power 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.690
 forgotten franchises mentioned that is 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.920
 this 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.840
