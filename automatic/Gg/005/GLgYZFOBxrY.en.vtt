00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.980
 newest disney animation movie 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.420

 a villain and 3 good guy he is he with him 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.270
 He wanted to be known as the good guy . 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.379
 also its rival of the game that is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 But the Felix type does not have everything like him 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.430
 world since the villains and everyone loves 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 the good guys did not like him 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 to become a hero of the day 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.090
 To the night then he resolved is and behind 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 of a medal that is this medal 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.040
 you would conquer if you finished if a 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.590
 game as if it were you will see if the game is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.540
 you win a medal and this medal 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.790
 would give him the recognition he wanted 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 all recognition of being a hero 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 even eh eh eh eh eh eh he had to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 that getting this medal is in a fps game 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.439
 he had to already zero the fps game 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.000
 and got this coin is that this 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.729
 When he embarks on this game, people 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.070
 knows a very tough sergeant who 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.720
 call the canon of the bossona type 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 I give them all of you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.780
 is he he invades a game with a mission 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.060
 simple I broke into it picks up the medal 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.659
 and back home with recognition that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 I just wanted it without wanting it 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.320
 ends up freeing a mortal villain who 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.310
 can end all the arcades that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.410
 exist 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.690
 so like what would be the only hope 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.890
 him that little girl who's talking 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 with him in the trailer that's the way it is the girl 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 call window pi and she is a character 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 of a car game is in the movie I do not know 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.540
 if this game really exists, but 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
 movie the character of a car game 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 she 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720
 she is a funny troublemaker girl 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.930
 also in the parts that it appears in the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.970
 movie is very funny and she tries 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.800
 show tries to show him what is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.319
 being the real good guy understood and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.560
 try to pass on a moral lesson to him 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.450
 to see if he learned some things 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.850
 only what will it be that it will 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 able to learn how to be the good guy 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.690
 true before the game over of all 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.209
 hospitals but you must have 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.959
 which fell so here're very end 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.430
 placing right is releasing but is e 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.190
 I will not tell you much more about the movie now 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.319
 I'll give more or less my opinion 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.750
 because if I tell you more, you're going to stay 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.370
 half spoiler 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.739
 so I'll be quieter the movie he 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.450
 It's a movie that Disney is 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.820
 trying to achieve in animation and 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.190
 adventure still reach an audience 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.579
 a little older than they reach 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.450
 usually because bringing a business 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.810
 of pro video games will have lots of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.060
 people are going to want to watch is because of 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.100
 because it shows a little of the 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.070
 videogame shows two characters from the 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.540
 street fighter mario's balzer shows 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.660
 the ghost of the pt nor if I am not mistaken 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.130
 he is the sub zero of the mortal kombat that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.370
 appears back there 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.329
 so I think they're trying 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.000
 reach an older audience is just 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.079
 I think that the producers of the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.440
 movie 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.780
 they made the film references of the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.609
 characters were the references a 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.739
 little old let's say like this 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.959
 reference of when they were children 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.760
 he I think he could have put 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.609
 this reference that was interesting 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.500
 but put one of the most 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.780
 current with the games but acts 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.530
 I think it would be very interesting. 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.970
 they did this so this is a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.410
 Small problem, but I can not speak 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.790
 what a dog is a bad movie because 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.230
 this is the movie is good, I recommend it 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.010
 An interesting movie for you. 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.390
 watching is not as me as I said 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.790
 I will not say anything else to not give 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.510
 spoiler and the video is staying here

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.680
