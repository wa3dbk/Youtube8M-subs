00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 ni 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.479
 ana 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.479
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.550
 Yes, today is polished for the saline problem that is get to a little a lot of people raised 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.720
 Let's go 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:23.940
 In fact, there is a special move and if you know this , for example 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 Let's combine with 8% saline and 15% salt supermarket 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:32.689
 I want to make 1700 g of 10% salt, but it is good to mix it . 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.190
 I think I see it, but this is my day 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.270
 Well 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.380
 Koch 200g in such radical voice 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.430
 Will be us planted a package that Tteyuu 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.860
 Hey this is always my best bet, yes 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:53.540
 The amount of salt because 10% of I'm turn is 1000 pages 700g is 70 grams 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:58.900
 Here the I xg Shitara, which has been percent shop's put a gram when the Koch 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.620
 I think I would do something like a simultaneous equation, but in fact it is easier 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.990
 Even judicial students can do that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:12.170
 There are people Let's do a little 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.170
 First located in the Fu say this with respect to the 8% of saline solution and 15% of the salt of 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.420
 First of all 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 15% saline solution 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.700
 Indicates information system 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.500
 Also on the same line 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.460
 8% saline solution 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 Already 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 Indicated by a rectangle 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.610
 It will be 10% if you mix it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 Please change to such Fu 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 It becomes like this and this is the number of salt of 15% 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.860
 Koch 8% of salt production 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.620
 Mixing it talk eyes and say, Masu' have this 10 percent of the saline 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.240
 Hmm 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.240
 And you can talk Tteyuu University part Yau it is almost entirely 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.810
 Now what do you do after this? 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 this 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.630
 It becomes this 10% saline solution but originally 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.069
 I'm sticking out here 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.860
 pr 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.790
 It will not protrude what or even 10 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:22.330
 Here of part I also large are plus 10% of than 8% 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:27.920
 Instead, this part of 15% is cut off, so I think about this rectangle 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.790
 In fact, the rectangular area of ​​this lane 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.960
 The area of ​​this rectangle is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 I think that it is the same area 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.680
 When we consider this graphically 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.680
 The difference between 10% and 15% is 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 5% 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.819
 10% is 8% difference 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.770
 2% 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.170
 Now that the area of ​​the rectangle is the same 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.270
 If here is the number position 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.660
 The ratio of the horizontal length will be the reverse day 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.660
 The fact that it is the reverse what high school pair here 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.650
 Rigid body 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.500
 It is it ok, is not it 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.630
 I am want right 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.250
 I want to say 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.690
 It will be for those who want to say in the rigid position 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.230
 It can be said that the area here and here is the same 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:34.810
 If it is divided into d of 700 grams because it is brother correspondence 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.530
 200g here ends with 500g 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.270
 15% of the sodium chloride number 200 grams but it is as I said 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.620
 This is the first part of a 500 % 8% salt quantity . 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.690
 Because it is this time while commenting now 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:04:08.319
 It would also dismissed safe once you entered in N head Well Cans to these 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:11.319
 Remember bouber pou dou dou 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.319
