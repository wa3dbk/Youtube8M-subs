00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.770
 Well big were coveted terminal to USA it is so while in 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.899
 Germany has not yet been interested in the expensive wireless tariff 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.209
 so right 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.699
 The hype surrounding the first apple mobile phone in the US has surpassed 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.149
 meanwhile, all present themselves experts 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.179
 did not expect such a hype tonight at 18 o'clock construction time can OS 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.340
 4 from the coveted phone finally hold in your hands 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.589
 only the spectacle on Fifth Avenue in New York 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.590
 the big wait for the apple phone iPhone cool drinks and some 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.519
 Self acting inclusive 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.129
 who find it normal to beg for alms while they are for 1 400 euros 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.200
 expensive phone waiting 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.610
 this was Boyle 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.249
 nobody thinks anymore has none take away 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.589
 he is not one one not the whole world knows that the AStA had been 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.930
 I'm waiting here in line for my friend and I hope I get 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.140
 a cell phone 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040
 the mobile phone is operated by finger pressure on the display and also the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.080
 Apple shares have increased over the past three months 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.740
 incessantly and drove up the value of the California high tech group 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.100
 over 100 billion euros 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.110
 even Apple boss Steve Jobs has obviously convinced his fans 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.799
 The iPhone is an absolute must 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.240
 For that, the fans of technology are also accepting the purchase for two years 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 Mobile operators irritatingly aim to be tied and euro monthly rates too 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.440
 numbers 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.210
 whether a similar concept can be implemented in Europe 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 is questionable 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 There are five to six major manufacturers 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 Verdi sees the market split as Apple will certainly play with it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.650
 but it will not be that the animals as I said has the desire for this 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.700
 Horse sees it can afford immediately because it will be very expensive if 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.530
 it comes to the shops 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.229
 in Europe, the iPhone should come in the fall on the market 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.380
 a distribution partner for Germany has not been decided yet 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.740
 we do not have an iPhone but dice founder Rolf Hollander 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.420
 Frankfurt am Main 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.150
 also very communicative Gucci by percent what determines the market percent 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.570
 to date 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.710
 but since when we finally saved here as well, request one 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.540
 Newspaper read changed in Germany think only ten 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.199
 Percent so that coach not really enforced 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.389
 but the effect he moved complained talked about trading in Frankfurt as well 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.529
 the reality today also almost one percent friendlier what the 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.889
 us exchanges total 2
