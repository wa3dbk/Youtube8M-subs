00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone my name is sergey and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 if this is watching then it is time for 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 a series of review mod for skyrim 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.469
 in general, I always wanted to be more precise 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.480
 Recently, see the mod for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.250
 skyrim and some selling but really 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 There are a lot of them, but finding a unique one 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 really hard well and I guess 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.529
 found something like that for example if you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 I do not want to know there is an overload with you and you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 need to drop things or don't know 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 I wanted to cast 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.270
 not in the city to run around so I 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 I present a mod portable tent 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.610
 him in general the tent is a singer with 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 using a spell that right now applied 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 and in general this spell appears 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 immediately after installing the mod 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.620
 who buy anything like them 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.820
 to that other 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.820
 magic on consumption in any bit 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 what 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.640
 that's the cat score itself in general as 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.800
 she sees inside much more than 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 outside but nevertheless there is a very 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.560
 a lot of things and all this is probably useful 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 stands for dofig bed shields creating 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.850
 his companions are like that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 personally bedrooms 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 dummies well and in general 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.490
 your personal weapons from the forge earl 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.680
 data like so on so on so on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.680
 similar chests 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.200
 in general, then you see him 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.930
 in fact it is in thick on 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.970
 personal front 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.240
 I remembered Harry Potter what was inside 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.450
 given add the second really 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.090
 that's cool very cool here is a table for 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:06.170
 gatherings probably already were in general 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:08.539
 I think it's time to go, in general, very 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.789
 tent how to clean appeal easy 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.180
 point to the shard and activate 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.050
 raise the tent itself spell can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.070
 find well if peremogi in witchcraft 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 go tent in general, then I think it can 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.170
 already finish this series of mods in general 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.150
