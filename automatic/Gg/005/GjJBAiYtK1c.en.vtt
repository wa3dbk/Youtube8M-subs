00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.789
 let's start with the outline of 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.860
 our butter for that we passed the 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:12.520
 thread by any of those from 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.770
 chains of the spaces and we started 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.429
 we raise three chains there are the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:24.400
 three and then we continue we make three 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.400
 all three 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.040
 a chain in the next space 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.480
 we work the same 3 integers 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.240
 one 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 two 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.410
 and three a chain 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 in the next space same 3 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.030
 integers 2 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.780
 3 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.579
 and a cart ok here we come if they are given 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.510
 account 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.600
 to one of the tips then at the tip 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 we are going to work a little shell of 33 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.330
 whole 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.670
 one 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.490
 everyone 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.860
 and 3 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:18.370
 1 2 3 chains and again 3 integers 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.370
 one 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.180
 everyone 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.550
 and 3 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.420
 we work again a chain and 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.229
 we continue working three whole 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.880
 separated from a string until you reach 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.299
 what we could say the corner 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.180
 our corner is going to be part of the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.920
 union of two squares 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.260
 let's continue 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 remember that it is three integers 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.960
 everyone 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.650
 3 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.220
 a chain 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.220
 or not 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.689
 3 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.689
 and a chain 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.860
 one 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 two 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 and three 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.860
 and a chain 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.109
 again we work the same and now 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 we come to the corner we need this 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.850
 nothing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.880
 one 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.860
 two 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.510
 3 and a chain that perfect when 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 we arrived here that is what we are going to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 do let's work 1 2 unfinished 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.550
 2 unfinished 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.740
 and three unfinished let's leave the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.270
 free center and let's do in the 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.250
 third 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.190
 world 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.900
 two 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.810
 and 3 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.659
 if they realize all three the six 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.200
 points are seven finished and now 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.760
 we finish them together we make a chain 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.450
 and it is already 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.010
 to see how we continue the same we are going to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.880
 work in each space three integers 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.020
 one 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.740
 two 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.380
 3 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.270
 a chain 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.840
 one 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.840
 two 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.780
 a chain 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.600
 and we will continue working the same until 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.140
 get to the next point 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.140
 or not 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.870
 3 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.409
 a chain 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.409
 one 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.770
 3 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.640
 a chain 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.300
 one 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.240
 two 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.500
 3 again a chain arrived 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.670
 again to 1 point as we work here 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.670
 three chains three whole sorry two 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.670
 three 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.850
 1 2 3 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.610
 three integers plus one 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.120
 two 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.120
 Y 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.840
 now we're heading back to the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.520
 base 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.330
 let's continue 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.110
 We made the chain and we made 3 whole 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.110
 or not 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.100
 two 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.100
 and 3 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 a chain 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.700
 one 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.680
 two 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.270
 and three 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.009
 really a chain 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.540
 or not 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.800
 two 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.990
 and 3 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.249
 again we make chain and we are 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.789
 close to arrive 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.789
 one 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.539
 and three 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.539
 chains 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.010
 two 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.430
 chain 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.320
 and we get back to the base then 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.320
 in the first we do 1 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.039
 two 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.349
 and three unfinished integers ok 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.619
 we leave the center that is the pill 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.720
 below and we go to the third same 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:55.260
 doing 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.260
 a 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.180
 two 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.520
 and 3 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.160
 once we have all six we get off 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.340
 the six of us and we make a chain and we're going to 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.139
 continue like weaving all around 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.190
 of our blanket 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.190
 this is what we will have 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.580
 simple enough enjoy weaving
