the 10-count

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.050 
the 10-count
I<00:02:17.540> put<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.530> sending<00:02:18.890> unit<00:02:18.950> back<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:19.970> I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
I put the sending unit back in because I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.340 
I put the sending unit back in because I
didn't<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> new<00:02:20.990> one

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
didn't have a new one
that's<00:02:22.530> slowly<00:02:22.950> coming<00:02:23.430> around<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.910> think

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that's slowly coming around I think

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.400 
that's slowly coming around I think
descending<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
descending and it's actually going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.690
