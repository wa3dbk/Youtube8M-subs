00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.870
 yes 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.550
 gustavo i 'm from riise today i'm a hundred 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.550
 one hundred Galician 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.930
 since I was little you see your 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.360
 family your parents at home being the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.900
 tute bacteria injured with a large 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.900
 advance to no 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.950
 the batteries are made of beams 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.170
 wood is generally eucalyptus is the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.270
 material more resistant to bending 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.040
 of season where the swell at the end of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.890
 its useful life 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.560
 how can you practice and in fact there are 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.030
 companies that build houses with the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.390
 woods that are profitable of those 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.390
 tables 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.180
 designation of origin solution to 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.160
 mussel because the result is 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.170
 quality that the mussel has in it 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.970
 still mention of galicia and that gives you that 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.990
 quality because that quality is given in 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.320
 the Galician estuaries 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.860
 Because of their geographies, they are considered unique 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.229
 in the world as a plankton reserve and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.600
 the seedling what the mussel like 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.299
 thanks to that big amount of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 plankton is the way in which 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.970
 we can get a mussel and from that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 unsurpassed quality 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.220
 the mussel production here is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.829
 amazing because you realize the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 force of nature you start from 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.440
 throw a rope to the sea with nothing 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.360
 no mussel 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.180
 After a few months in activity 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.740
 mussel stuck after a few months passed 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.170
 and you see that it was that the least 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
 growing and some strings are forming 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.390
 with incredible amounts of 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.390
 mussel 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.400
 we try to take care of him as they did 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.640
 our grandparents handmade with 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.730
 degradable materials and to get 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.970
 that quality that today has a 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.970
 armchair
