00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
two it's very very easy to recover take

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.079 
two it's very very easy to recover take
your<00:00:42.949> left<00:00:43.010> hand<00:00:43.249> needle<00:00:43.519> and<00:00:44.530> find<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.710> first

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
your left hand needle and find the first

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.079 
your left hand needle and find the first
loop<00:00:47.089> that<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.769> those<00:00:49.129> two<00:00:49.399> obviously<00:00:49.969> have

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
loop that so those two obviously have

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.479 
loop that so those two obviously have
been<00:00:50.480> dropped<00:00:50.749> this<00:00:51.409> guy<00:00:51.679> still<00:00:52.069> looks<00:00:52.280> like<00:00:52.370> a

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
been dropped this guy still looks like a

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.340 
been dropped this guy still looks like a
knit<00:00:52.789> stitch<00:00:52.819> ease<00:00:53.300> he's<00:00:53.749> still<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.230> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
knit stitch ease he's still in the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.739 
knit stitch ease he's still in the
column<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.460> that's<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.969> first<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:56.390> you'll<00:00:56.569> go

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
column so that's the first one you'll go

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.279 
column so that's the first one you'll go
in<00:00:57.579> pick<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:58.850> up<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:59.300> your<00:00:59.479> needle<00:00:59.690> with

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289

your<00:01:00.469> left<00:01:00.620> hand<00:01:00.739> needle<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.629> then<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.800> can

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
your left hand needle and then you can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.980 
your left hand needle and then you can
see<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.489> dropped<00:01:04.850> two<00:01:05.089> stitches<00:01:05.390> there<00:01:05.780> these

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
see I dropped two stitches there these

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.310 
see I dropped two stitches there these
two<00:01:06.790> these<00:01:07.790> two<00:01:07.850> guys<00:01:08.270> form<00:01:08.659> basically<00:01:08.930> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
two these two guys form basically a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.289 
two these two guys form basically a
ladder<00:01:09.799> might<00:01:10.340> be<00:01:10.460> easier<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.939> see<00:01:11.090> on<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
ladder might be easier to see on the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.530 
ladder might be easier to see on the
back<00:01:11.479> side<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:13.250> those<00:01:13.549> are<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.790> two<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.360> I'm

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
back side so those are the two that I'm

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.969 
back side so those are the two that I'm
going<00:01:14.719> to<00:01:14.810> want<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.110> pick<00:01:15.290> up<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.710> we've<00:01:18.710> got

going to want to pick up so we've got
our<00:01:19.009> live<00:01:19.759> stitch<00:01:20.149> saved<00:01:20.539> it's<00:01:20.930> not<00:01:21.140> going<00:01:21.259> to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
our live stitch saved it's not going to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.649 
our live stitch saved it's not going to
keep<00:01:21.530> running<00:01:21.890> what<00:01:22.820> we'll<00:01:22.969> do<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.299> we'll<00:01:23.420> pick

first<00:01:26.570> rung<00:01:26.899> and<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:28.670> go<00:01:28.909> from<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.509> bottom<00:01:30.280> pick

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
first rung and I go from the bottom pick

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.999 
first rung and I go from the bottom pick
it<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.520> with<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.789> left<00:01:32.000> hand<00:01:32.149> needle<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.009> then

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
it up with the left hand needle and then

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.950 
it up with the left hand needle and then
take<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.310> knit<00:01:34.759> stitch<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.390> just<00:01:35.600> pull<00:01:35.840> it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
take that knit stitch and just pull it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.399 
take that knit stitch and just pull it
right<00:01:36.140> over<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.500> top<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:38.899> rung<00:01:39.200> and

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
right over the top of that rung and

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.219 
right over the top of that rung and
you've<00:01:39.859> created<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.240> new<00:01:41.450> knit<00:01:41.630> stitch<00:01:41.930> there

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
you've created a new knit stitch there

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.209 
you've created a new knit stitch there
and<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.119> go<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.359> to<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.659> next<00:01:44.869> rung

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
and so then you go up to the next rung

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.039 
and so then you go up to the next rung
and<00:01:46.219> pick<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.670> up<00:01:46.789> with<00:01:46.939> your<00:01:47.000> needle<00:01:47.359> from<00:01:47.840> the
