have had a bit more time looking looking

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.440 
have had a bit more time looking looking
back<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.460> attested<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> more

back to have attested some of the more

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710 
back to have attested some of the more
complex<00:01:06.900> circuits<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.479> was

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
complex circuits but as it was this was

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
complex circuits but as it was this was
a<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:09.990> made<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.130> children<00:01:11.549> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
mind and the kids that are there on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
mind and the kids that are there on the
day<00:01:14.070> we're<00:01:14.280> enjoying<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> great<00:01:15.180> deal

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
day we're enjoying the game a great deal

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
day we're enjoying the game a great deal
so<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> certainly<00:01:16.049> does<00:01:16.290> its<00:01:16.470> job<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.580> see

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so it certainly does its job we can see

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
so it certainly does its job we can see
there<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.150> quite<00:01:18.330> taxing<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:19.020> me<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> terms

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there it's quite taxing for me in terms

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.969 
there it's quite taxing for me in terms
of<00:01:19.770> racing<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:21.060> pushing<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> limit<00:01:22.259> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of racing really pushing to the limit in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.149 
of racing really pushing to the limit in
terms<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.580> intensity<00:01:24.409> focusing<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
terms of my intensity focusing on that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
terms of my intensity focusing on that
next<00:01:26.490> apex<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.330> into<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> castle<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.920> we

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
next apex and into the castle there we

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.390 
next apex and into the castle there we
go<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.259> focusing<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
go and I'm actually focusing more on the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
go and I'm actually focusing more on the
weapons<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.390> I've<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.110> trying<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
weapons that I've got and trying to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
weapons that I've got and trying to
understand<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.030> that's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
understand what they are I think that's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.249 
understand what they are I think that's
one<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> things<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> thought<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.110> little

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
one of the things I thought was a little

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
one of the things I thought was a little
bit<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> drawback<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> didn't

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
bit of a drawback for me was I didn't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
bit of a drawback for me was I didn't
know<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.600> half<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> weapons<00:01:40.290> were<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.250> know

camera
there's<00:02:06.180> also<00:02:06.450> full<00:02:06.720> live<00:02:06.930> commentary<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
there's also full live commentary to the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.639 
there's also full live commentary to the
game<00:02:08.040> which<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> interesting<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.500> find<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
game which is interesting I find it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
game which is interesting I find it
works<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.070> well<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.460> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> G's<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:11.970> up

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
works really well it kind of G's you up

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.920 
works really well it kind of G's you up
to<00:02:12.750> push<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.560> harder<00:02:14.180> nice<00:02:15.180> there's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
to push a bit harder nice there's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.270 
to push a bit harder nice there's
something<00:02:16.140> nice<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.500> hear<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.860> driving<00:02:17.250> game

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
something nice to hear in a driving game

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.220 
something nice to hear in a driving game
so<00:02:17.580> many<00:02:17.760> racing<00:02:18.180> games<00:02:18.390> don't<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.810> any<00:02:18.930> form

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
so many racing games don't have any form

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.560 
so many racing games don't have any form
of<00:02:19.320> in-game<00:02:19.590> commentary<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> bit<00:02:21.480> of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
of in-game commentary and it's a bit of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.660 
of in-game commentary and it's a bit of
a<00:02:21.600> shame<00:02:21.810> really<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.440> kind<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.740> miss<00:02:23.490> out

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
a shame really that you kind of miss out

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.390 
a shame really that you kind of miss out
on<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.320> because<00:02:25.320> even<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.830> my<00:02:25.980> picture
