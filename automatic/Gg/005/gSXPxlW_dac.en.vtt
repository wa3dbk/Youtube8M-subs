out<00:01:26.000> or<00:01:26.179> giving<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.810> chance<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.380> get

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
out or giving you like a chance to get

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.320 
out or giving you like a chance to get
our<00:01:27.679> 100<00:01:28.429> percent<00:01:28.670> chance<00:01:28.789> to<00:01:28.940> get<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.209> your

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
our 100 percent chance to get on your

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.089 
our 100 percent chance to get on your
next<00:01:29.539> Supply<00:01:29.810> Drop<00:01:29.869> alright<00:01:30.709> they've<00:01:30.890> done

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
next Supply Drop alright they've done

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.770 
next Supply Drop alright they've done
previously<00:01:31.550> for<00:01:31.729> some<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.030> new<00:01:32.149> exosuits

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
previously for some of the new exosuits

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.870 
previously for some of the new exosuits
like<00:01:32.899> for<00:01:33.050> Earth<00:01:33.200> Day<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.950> had<00:01:34.069> a<00:01:34.099> 100<00:01:34.640> percent

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
like for Earth Day you had a 100 percent

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.190 
like for Earth Day you had a 100 percent
chance<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.239> getting<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:35.599> soon<00:01:35.869> as<00:01:35.989> soon<00:01:36.110> as

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
chance of getting that soon as soon as

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.139 
chance of getting that soon as soon as
you<00:01:36.289> open<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.739> up<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.039> a<00:01:37.429> Supply<00:01:37.729> Drop<00:01:37.789> so

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
you open it up and a Supply Drop so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.430 
you open it up and a Supply Drop so
maybe<00:01:38.330> they'll<00:01:38.509> do<00:01:38.660> something<00:01:38.869> similar<00:01:39.229> with

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
maybe they'll do something similar with

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.089 
maybe they'll do something similar with
the<00:01:39.530> asm1

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
the asm1

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.830 
the asm1
now<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.700> course<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.300> all<00:01:41.509> just

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
now of course this is all just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.419 
now of course this is all just
speculation<00:01:42.110> take<00:01:42.679> it<00:01:42.800> off<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.039> greatest<00:01:43.220> all

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
speculation take it off the greatest all

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:44.410 
speculation take it off the greatest all
he<00:01:43.550> could<00:01:43.759> mean<00:01:43.970> something<00:01:44.330> completely

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
he could mean something completely

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.139 
he could mean something completely
different<00:01:44.989> but<00:01:45.950> just<00:01:46.099> from<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.640> know<00:01:46.670> reading

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
different but just from you know reading

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.999 
different but just from you know reading
it<00:01:47.239> right<00:01:47.479> straight<00:01:48.020> up<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.319> comprehending

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
it right straight up and comprehending

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.370 
it right straight up and comprehending
it<00:01:49.099> exactly<00:01:49.580> as<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.819> says<00:01:50.030> he<00:01:50.780> says<00:01:51.050> there's

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
it exactly as it says he says there's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.010 
it exactly as it says he says there's
gonna<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.830> 100%<00:01:52.640> chance<00:01:53.000> increase<00:01:53.810> in

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
gonna be a 100% chance increase in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.559 
gonna be a 100% chance increase in
getting<00:01:54.229> an<00:01:54.319> elite<00:01:54.560> asm1<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:55.789> let's<00:01:56.360> think

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
getting an elite asm1 now let's think

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.240 
getting an elite asm1 now let's think
about<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:56.959> for<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> second<00:01:57.530> there's<00:01:57.770> nothing

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
about this for a second there's nothing

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
about this for a second there's nothing
higher<00:01:58.459> than<00:01:58.489> 100<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.300> anything<00:02:00.080> less<00:02:00.349> than

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
higher than 100 and anything less than

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.999 
higher than 100 and anything less than
100<00:02:01.099> is<00:02:01.220> not<00:02:01.550> certain<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.539> 100<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.319> certain

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
100 is not certain but 100 is certain

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.740 
100 is not certain but 100 is certain
you<00:02:04.099> can't<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.489> any<00:02:04.640> more<00:02:04.729> certain<00:02:05.179> than<00:02:05.209> 100%

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
you can't get any more certain than 100%

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.749 
you can't get any more certain than 100%
so<00:02:06.229> I'm<00:02:06.649> looking<00:02:07.009> forward<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.459> if<00:02:07.640> he's

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
so I'm looking forward to see if he's

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.249 
so I'm looking forward to see if he's
actually<00:02:07.910> gonna<00:02:08.209> incorporate<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.899> asm1

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
actually gonna incorporate the asm1

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.440 
actually gonna incorporate the asm1
giving<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.250> people<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.580> elite<00:02:10.819> asm1

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
giving it to people the elite asm1

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
giving it to people the elite asm1
and<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.959> stats<00:02:12.230> for<00:02:12.410> all<00:02:12.530> these<00:02:12.709> guns

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and the stats for all these guns

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.710 
and the stats for all these guns
actually<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.520> very<00:02:13.670> similar<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.510> know<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
actually are very similar you know in

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.150 
actually are very similar you know in
terms<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.320> speakeasy<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.890> maybe

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
terms of like the speakeasy and maybe

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.950 
terms of like the speakeasy and maybe
the<00:02:16.220> royalty<00:02:16.670> elite<00:02:16.940> version<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.510> asm1

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
the royalty elite version of this asm1

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.330 
the royalty elite version of this asm1
are<00:02:18.170> pretty<00:02:18.380> similar<00:02:18.650> they

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
are pretty similar they

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.770 
are pretty similar they
have<00:02:19.519> exactly<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> same<00:02:20.239> stats<00:02:20.510> which<00:02:20.690> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
have exactly the same stats which is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.300 
have exactly the same stats which is
kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.959> cool<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.709> basically<00:02:21.860> just

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
kind of cool so that basically just

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.400 
kind of cool so that basically just
introduces<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.910> new<00:02:23.209> completely<00:02:23.900> different

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
introduces a new completely different

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.619 
introduces a new completely different
style<00:02:24.860> weapon<00:02:25.310> into<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.519> game<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.269> also<00:02:26.420> has

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
style weapon into the game it also has

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.580 
style weapon into the game it also has
to<00:02:26.690> be<00:02:26.720> thinking<00:02:26.930> whether<00:02:27.230> or<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.440> they're

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
to be thinking whether or not they're

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.680 
to be thinking whether or not they're
gonna<00:02:27.709> actually<00:02:27.950> allow<00:02:28.370> other<00:02:28.940> variants<00:02:29.599> to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
gonna actually allow other variants to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.059 
gonna actually allow other variants to
be<00:02:29.780> given<00:02:29.989> up<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.260> people<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.590> free<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.920> for

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
be given up to people for free so for

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.990 
be given up to people for free so for
example<00:02:31.400> maybe<00:02:31.489> they'll<00:02:31.670> give<00:02:31.790> out<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
example maybe they'll give out the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.660 
example maybe they'll give out the
Royals<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> hbr<00:02:32.959> are<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.709> royalty<00:02:34.040> Moors<00:02:34.430> or

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
Royals the hbr are the royalty Moors or

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.610 
Royals the hbr are the royalty Moors or
something<00:02:34.940> else<00:02:35.090> besides<00:02:35.569> just<00:02:35.750> asm1<00:02:36.319> or<00:02:36.560> if

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
something else besides just asm1 or if

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.350 
something else besides just asm1 or if
it's<00:02:36.739> gonna<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.980> exclusively<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> ASM<00:02:38.180> one

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
it's gonna be exclusively the ASM one

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.910 
it's gonna be exclusively the ASM one
that's<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.049> gonna<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:39.319> interesting<00:02:39.860> to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
that's really gonna be interesting to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
that's really gonna be interesting to
see<00:02:40.069> how<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:40.610> plays<00:02:40.849> out<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.180> thanks<00:02:41.450> so
