00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 

I<00:02:49.200> mean<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.070> would<00:02:50.250> try<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.520> steal<00:02:50.820> under<00:02:51.150> normal

I mean I would try to steal under normal

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
I mean I would try to steal under normal
circumstances<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.350> because<00:02:52.710> we<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:53.070> no

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
circumstances but because we have no

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.520 
circumstances but because we have no
runs<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> board<00:02:53.880> misses<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.050> ball<00:02:55.230> one

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
runs on the board misses for ball one

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.650 
runs on the board misses for ball one
and<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.610> late<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> game<00:02:57.360> I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.770 
and it's not that late in the game I
don't<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> risk<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:59.630> action<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780
