00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.550
 Rubik's cube has been very successful at 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:13.750
 throughout all the years it has been 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.200
 sold to 350 million people 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.770
 I am ale and in today's video we are going to 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.200
 do the review of a cube watch the cube 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.980
 clock 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.170
 from rubik 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.880
 and well first of all I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.400
 As you can see, I changed the focus and 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.900
 place and now I think there's more light you 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.940
 can you tell me for the comments 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.650
 that this place offers and I think it is 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.690
 better the truth you will tell me and 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.610
 later but personally I think it's 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.769
 better good 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.000
 here we have the famous rubik's cube 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:48.370
 watch I think almost none or no 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.860
 Spanish has done a review of this cube 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.170
 that is not a cube itself as you will be 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.510
 as you will be seeing it is already a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.960
 alarm clock so to speak but they are not 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.420
 the alarm clock and now now has the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.000
 alarm clock obviously points the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.970
 temperature and also the date 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 As you can see the colors are very vivid I think 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.390
 that this is not the official rubik's cube 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
 but well I'm not really sure the truth 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.800
 I think so but it was a gift and to me 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.450
 They said yes but I 'm not too sure 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.740
 since I've seen other versions that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.130
 do not put the letters just put the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.020
 little clock on the rod is on the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.080
 notepad etcetera but good I think that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.420
 it's a very good one and I'm almost certain 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.430
 sure of the ruby brand as you see 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.670
 the colors as I said are very vivid 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.860
 that wants and is messy is not 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.540
 done the cube because if it's messy 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.660
 it is much more colorful and much better 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.180
 it gives a touch of 80s style that the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.610
 I really think it's very beautiful and good as 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.240
 you see to change the weapon time and everything 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.240
 that is done well 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.100
 as if it were a real cube of rubik 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.230
 this seems very cool to me for example 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.360
 I wake up every day with this 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.700
 cube and if I want to change the alarm I do 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.810
 A) Yes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.550
 if I put 7 to 8 for example at 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.270
 8 51 not but we're going to leave it as 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.330
 I was 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.190
 so I think that in general this cube is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.380
 very beautiful and you can buy it in many 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.300
 in many stores that sell it like this in 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.430
 modern stores of these or also by 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.350
 internet I think that by the rubik page 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.960
 you can find it and good 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.270
 In general, I want to tell you that if you are 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.980
 true fans of rubik's cube 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.380
 this has to be a secured purchase 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.510
 because it is a very nice watch is very 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.950
 well and I think I'm going to put it on all 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 the videos always on the one hand like that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.560
 while I do things with cubes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.350
 I leave that aside and I suppose 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.720
 it is very good not good to also tell you 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.800
 that this video I did mainly 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.270
 because a subscriber asked me to 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.950
 I did a review of this fantastic 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.570
 watch cube and good I see it every day 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.090
 when I wake up and normal I make a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.000
 review I do not know perfectly 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.550
 I even had this before the cubes of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.130

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.960

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.050
 I wanted to tell you for today is a cube 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.940
 incredible very nice 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.580
 and the truth has some colors and a 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 fascinating design in my opinion so 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.330
 well this was all I wanted to say 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.380
