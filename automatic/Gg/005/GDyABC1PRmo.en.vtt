00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 a little trick how to turn on wifi 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 on a laptop without key combination fn + 1 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 from the function keys on laptops 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.150
 differently but you need a laptop 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.100
 the keyboard doesn't work that's why 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.519
 connect just wifi no 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.019
 get drivers on the wi-fi network 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.359
 installed on the network he does not see here itself 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.689
 the network it is on just shows that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.689
 no connection 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.800
 you need to make it big 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.680
 I worked constantly as a stationary 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.809
 computer without any power button 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.430
 shutdown now I will show how it is 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.729
 done i think for most 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.159
 notebooks it will fit this 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:03.070
 a laptop 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:04.809
 all the cogs I have already paid out of it as well 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.979
 you need to unscrew all principle 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.720
 cogs on the perimeter and then neatly 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 hide laptop 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.640
 now you need to remove the entire map 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:32.240
 wireless turn on the antenna 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.240
 unscrew the network card 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.890
 now needed on network card 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.590
 tap up 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 one of contacts number twenty 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.080
 located here on this side if 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.670
 look from the key from the slot then this 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.100
 it turns out 1 contact we miss a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.100
 the second contact must be sealed 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 This is 20 contact write express in a laptop 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 we take adhesive tape with a stock glue it right on 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.680
 group on group contact trudged 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.680
 take fresh juice 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.320
 then glue on the contact group 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.870
 immediately three contact neighboring is captured 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.870
 now gently cut off the excess 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 now you need to remove the extra pieces 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.010
 scotch tape 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.430
 gently trim the tape around 20 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.250
 contact that is the next contact must 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.340
 stay without tape for this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.510
 parallel cuts correctly 20 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.209
 the cut is necessary 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:39.459
 neatly so as not to damage the neighboring 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:44.500
 track adjacent pins and delete pieces 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.500
 Scotch adjacent contacts 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.690
 we 've cut everything here 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.260
 and scotch remained with us only on one 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:05.959
 20 contact here on the next 19 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.230
 need spheres contact scotch no well 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.640
 now we put back the network card 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.300
 We also insert it carefully so that the tracks 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.660
 accurate contacts 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.660
 the connector does not slide do not damage the tape 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.199
 unscrew the board 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.180
 we connect antennas 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.870
 close the lid 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.160
 check remind keyboards on this one 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.320
 a laptop 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:05.290
 netbook 8-m works with it completely 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.010
 disconnected as used external 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.000
 Urbi keyboards and see the message 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:19.330
 MTS detected wired network click but 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.660
 Wi-Fi and see that the list of connections 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.660
 to wi-fi networks we have full 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.330
 now there is no need to install 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.370
 install driver software more precisely 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:42.419
 key utilities 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.419
 Wi-Fi quality 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.100
 thanks to all
