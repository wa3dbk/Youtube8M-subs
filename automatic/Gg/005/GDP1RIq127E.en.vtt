00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.039 

for<00:00:11.670> whatever<00:00:11.820> reason<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.420> camera<00:00:12.690> decided

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
for whatever reason the camera decided

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.919 
for whatever reason the camera decided
not<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> record<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.389> I'm<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
not to record it so I'm going to do it

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.790 
not to record it so I'm going to do it
again<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:18.050> don't<00:00:19.050> often<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.410> things<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.740> are

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
again I don't often do things that are

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.670 
again I don't often do things that are
very<00:00:19.980> crazy<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.850> my<00:00:21.090> motorcycle<00:00:21.560> because<00:00:22.560> I'm

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
very crazy on my motorcycle because I'm

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.099 
very crazy on my motorcycle because I'm
always<00:00:22.830> scared<00:00:23.869> something's<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
always scared something's going to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.620 
always scared something's going to
happen<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.880> scared<00:00:26.970> when<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.330> did<00:00:27.480> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
happen and I was scared when I did this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.320 
happen and I was scared when I did this
too<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.789> decided<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.029> worth<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.300> try

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
too but I decided it was worth a try

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
too but I decided it was worth a try
even<00:00:31.080> though<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.710> 35<00:00:32.640> miles<00:00:33.149> from

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
even though I'm like 35 miles from

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
even though I'm like 35 miles from
civilization<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.380> anything<00:00:34.710> were<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> go

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
civilization and if anything were to go

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060 
civilization and if anything were to go
really<00:00:35.489> badly<00:00:35.760> wrong<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:37.110> might<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.739> kind<00:00:38.010> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
really badly wrong it might be kind of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.650 
really badly wrong it might be kind of
nasty<00:00:38.809> but<00:00:40.850> yeah<00:00:41.850> i<00:00:41.879> decided<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.060 
climb this little bit back here so i did
it<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.969> wasn't<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.270> bad<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:52.070> was

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
it and it wasn't that bad actually was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
it and it wasn't that bad actually was
not<00:00:53.280> nearly<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.670> scary<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.300> expected<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
not nearly as scary as i expected it to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.610 
not nearly as scary as i expected it to
be

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.410

here<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> talked<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.910> for<00:01:18.000> about

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
here and I talked about it for about

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.000 
here and I talked about it for about
five<00:01:18.450> minutes<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> bottom

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
five minutes and then got to the bottom

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.560 
five minutes and then got to the bottom
and<00:01:20.160> realized<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.610> hadn't<00:01:20.790> recorded<00:01:21.030> any<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and realized I hadn't recorded any of it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.670 
and realized I hadn't recorded any of it
