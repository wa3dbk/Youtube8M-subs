00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.160

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 the chicken cutlet 12 france at the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 mediterranean is first the recipe 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.759
 is very simple so that will start 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 by cutting cherry tomatoes in half 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.529
 years we depend on the size and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.940
 really tiny incentives you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.510
 can leave like this and me during this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.900
 time there I will prepare the peppers 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.570
 in small thin slices and I'm going 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 do the same thing with the audio then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.270
 you do the same thing with the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.700
 zucchini you take off both 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 ends and you go detailed then 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.559
 either in two wheels are small slats 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 like that see the 2 mm and actually soft 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 France is a cooperative of breeders of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 poultry ah yes they are very engaged 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.940
 on animal welfare 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 we can even find the name of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.489
 the breeder on the label 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 now you are going to season your 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.449
 chicken fillets then you put them 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 on a small board and leave you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 go both ways I prefer 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 really season all the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 poultry before because it allows 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 to have better distribute the one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 to have a product that will be better 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.460
 after agreeing you preheat your 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.840
 stove or a wok as you have and there one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.840
 will put antifi deducted 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 and we will color on is sure the on the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 chicken fillet there are 2 10 to 2 face to 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.680
 once what's smoother we're going 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.270
 start with colorful the most phase 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.960
 beautiful if this is the face you 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.830
 introduce your guests 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.240
 so what is very important is 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.270
 to have a hot oil 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.860
 good to grab your chicken fillets and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 we will cook them for 3 minutes on each 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.750
 face 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.150
 it's been three minutes on the first 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.920
 phase and gently returns because 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.470
 what's very important is the pretty rape 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.300
 color expects chicken fillet 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.530
 because it gives taste is called 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.229
 with its mesh what is really 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.759
 to do a kirby late this Strasbourg and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.430

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 colorful they are still a tiny 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.570
 little less than hacker ie 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.890
 after we warm them up in the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.090
 ivory vegetables it's very simple what 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.980

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:25.410

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.410
 I add but peppers and my onions 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.650
