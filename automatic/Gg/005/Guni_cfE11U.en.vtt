00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.230
 to place with humility and make today 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 we even a little bit what's funny one 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.030
 little cool tune that everyone knows and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.690
 Although Mario was not complete now 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.949
 otherwise played becomes so extensive and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.699
 yes we just go in I show 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.989
 check out the tabs and 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 There are special features that are there 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.769
 so yes we go in here now so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.629
 we have to play here all the time 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.969
 was in the first position please once 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 we have to go back to the 5, too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.770
 Let's go in and play 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 three times zero 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.720
 I could see well I make time 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.720
 so is better or better 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 he has three times the zero on then 10 3 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 and then once the g string that becomes 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.950
 there's a short break there, too 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.030
 and then we go 1 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.289
 now 21 hours then the two games 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 I with the index finger I go then 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.060
 as barry in there so press with the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 Forefinger both sides down the idea 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.310
 and the g string that you de 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.840
 then play the side then the four 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.780
 sometimes the ring finger 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 middle finger 3 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 on page 2 that is why the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.840
 Forefinger also stand the whole time 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.840
 stay and then the zero 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.290
 there would have to be this rhythm of mario 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.590
 there 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.710
 there's this trio 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 then comes the zero 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.100
 then we have to stop two 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.069
 zero on the side we go to the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:42.630
 page 0 35 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.630
 high 1 3013 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.920
 and the new page 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.170
 there's everyone there because everyone thinks 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 Mario would be totally easy, it is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 not if you really do it now 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.489
 plays as synonymous in the song, yes, too 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.489
 is played 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.190
 accented with this light notes 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.810
 with the little day shift so that 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.260
 If that were to happen then again 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.370
 this part meter 1 that comes then 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.970
 Stop and then we come in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 this part 1 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.769
 so it is true so so 3 2 1 on 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.769
 page 45 o'clock 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.580
 you can play the belly so 321 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.350
 then 4 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.460
 and then here in the day is now 5 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.020
 but you can also zero here 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:48.450
 play as he likes 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.450
 a 21 21 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.820
 a two years 2 1 1 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.330
 then again and then we go 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:09.350
 even on the eight make a little 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:13.720
 vibrato maybe or is suffering like that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:16.820
 a little bit goes well then we have 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.470
 the game once comes along with play 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.470
 that in the end is again now 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:32.330
 but the conclusion fell 31 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.380
 as a game once completely complete 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.380
 front to back through 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:17.369
 this was also played staccato 

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:17.369
 So in short, depended 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.940
 to say that you have to neck 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.770
 be nimble in the fingers 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.449
 Mario is played so there is still 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.220
 versions below or below 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.810
 but you could be nice on top of that 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.940
 teacher's side up in the first position 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.410
 Can you play that well then yes 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.970
 all the time if you have seen that 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.970
 I use a lot of change here 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:53.690
 can you see we see yes and here 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.690
 for example, at the 0 0 2 2 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.530
 I have them from above too 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.550
 again from above 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.160
 I 'm not doing a change now 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.160
 but the economic start that 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.830
 beat away again 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.310
 once put away and malek that was 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.330
 Mario actually quite fast and 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.400
 easy to learn 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.440
 I would like you tunes like that too 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.930
 always my lack because it in the end 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.280
 a hidden finger exercise is still 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.750
 that's fun if any 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.640
 People come players need a game 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.860
 was mario and looks after already 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:46.780
 what is out and you can not do it that easy 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:49.120
 after playing if you can see it with it 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.830
 please say like my videos 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.950
