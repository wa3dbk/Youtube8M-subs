well there's still a while but they're
kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> roaming<00:00:40.110> around<00:00:40.460> where<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.519> can

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
kind of roaming around where you can

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
kind of roaming around where you can
actually<00:00:41.820> walk<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.269> them<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.159> and<00:00:44.159> how<00:00:44.580> I<00:00:44.610> used

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
actually walk to them and and how I used

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.509 
actually walk to them and and how I used
a<00:00:45.510> shallow<00:00:45.900> depth<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.290> field<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.280> rule<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
a shallow depth of field and the rule of

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.329 
a shallow depth of field and the rule of
thirds<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.900> capture<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> amazing<00:00:50.010> image

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
thirds to to capture this amazing image

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.430 
thirds to to capture this amazing image
them<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.720> in<00:00:51.809> love<00:00:51.839> of<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.290> I've

them I'm just in love of that I've
printed<00:00:52.920> large<00:00:53.519> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> canvas<00:00:54.299> for<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.839> couple

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
printed large on the canvas for a couple

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.899 
printed large on the canvas for a couple
of<00:00:55.500> people<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> didn't<00:00:56.339> South<00:00:56.489> Africa<00:00:56.820> that

of people that didn't South Africa that
we<00:00:57.030> stayed<00:00:57.299> with<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.720> I'm<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> put<00:00:59.159> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we stayed with and I'm going to put it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.660 
we stayed with and I'm going to put it
on<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.150> wall<00:01:00.360> up<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.080> a<00:01:01.769> large<00:01:02.100> piece<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on my wall up here as a large piece of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
on my wall up here as a large piece of
life<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.540> going<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.839> through<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
life but I'm going to go through how the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.820 
life but I'm going to go through how the
rule<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> thirds<00:01:05.100> works<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.850> comes<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
rule of thirds works when it comes to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.240 
rule of thirds works when it comes to
making<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:08.070> image<00:01:08.340> more<00:01:09.000> appealing<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> enjoy

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

this<00:01:11.460> tutorial<00:01:12.320> ok<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:13.890> at

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
this tutorial ok let's have a look at

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.880 
this tutorial ok let's have a look at
this<00:01:14.189> beautiful<00:01:15.030> zebra<00:01:15.930> image<00:01:16.230> I<00:01:16.380> took<00:01:16.440> in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this beautiful zebra image I took in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.500 
this beautiful zebra image I took in
marloth<00:01:17.670> park<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.440> I'll<00:01:19.440> go<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.980> to<00:01:20.510> where

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
marloth park and I'll go back to where

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.540 
marloth park and I'll go back to where
we<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.530> image<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:22.950> its<00:01:23.100> own<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
we just look at the image on its own so

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.270 
we just look at the image on its own so
what<00:01:26.550> makes<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.030> image<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.720> great<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.530> for

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
what makes this image so great for for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.430 
what makes this image so great for for
the<00:01:29.490> viewer<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.960> comes<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.260> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
the viewer and it all comes down to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.290 
the viewer and it all comes down to
basically<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.220> rule<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> thirds<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
basically the rule of thirds when it

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.080 
basically the rule of thirds when it
comes<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.630> composition<00:01:34.790> now<00:01:35.790> you'll<00:01:35.940> notice

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
comes to composition now you'll notice

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.750 
comes to composition now you'll notice
the<00:01:36.420> Zebras<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.560> hear<00:01:37.920> that's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.340> focal<00:01:38.730> point

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
the Zebras I hear that's a focal point

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.840 
the Zebras I hear that's a focal point
so<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.870> are<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.080> focal<00:01:40.440> points<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.159> an<00:01:41.640> image

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so what are the focal points in an image

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
so what are the focal points in an image
normally<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.890> areas<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
normally which areas are is the I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.000 
normally which areas are is the I
attract<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.370> normally<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.000> an<00:01:48.540> image<00:01:48.690> well<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
attract to normally in an image well the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.190 
attract to normally in an image well the
points<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.940> interest<00:01:51.300> or<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.510> focal<00:01:51.870> points

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
points of interest or the focal points

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.090 
points of interest or the focal points
in<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.470> image<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:53.130> normally<00:01:53.610> either<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
in an image are normally either the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.289 
in an image are normally either the
areas<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.430> lighter<00:01:56.760> than<00:01:56.909> everything

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.300 
the rest of the image another place
where<00:02:11.400> people<00:02:11.459> look<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.780> an<00:02:13.019> area<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.440> where

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
where people look is is an area of where

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.430 
where people look is is an area of where
the<00:02:14.519> image<00:02:14.790> sharper<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.900> where<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.319> not

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the image sharper so where it's not

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.039 
the image sharper so where it's not
blurred<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.120> image<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.569> want<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.870> view

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
blurred so in this image I want the view

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.690 
blurred so in this image I want the view
to<00:02:19.170> come<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.799> look<00:02:19.859> at<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.249> area<00:02:20.609> of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to come and have a look at this area of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.200 
to come and have a look at this area of
here<00:02:20.939> we

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
here we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.800 
here we
whether<00:02:21.660> zebras<00:02:22.290> Eyres<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.540> what<00:02:24.540> I've<00:02:24.660> done

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
whether zebras Eyres and what I've done

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.940 
whether zebras Eyres and what I've done
is<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> photograph<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.800> zebra<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:27.180> its<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
is a photograph the zebra with its I in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.250 
is a photograph the zebra with its I in
focus<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.270> use<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.570> shallow<00:02:30.840> depth<00:02:31.110> of

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
focus and I use the shallow depth of

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.860 
focus and I use the shallow depth of
field<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.830> basically<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> wide<00:02:32.940> open<00:02:33.270> aperture

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
field so basically a wide open aperture

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.950 
field so basically a wide open aperture
a<00:02:34.440> very<00:02:35.220> wide<00:02:35.490> aperture<00:02:35.730> which<00:02:36.180> gives<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
a very wide aperture which gives me a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.270 
a very wide aperture which gives me a
shallow<00:02:37.230> depth<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.620> field<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:39.090> focused<00:02:39.720> on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
shallow depth of field and I focused on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.890 
shallow depth of field and I focused on
her<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.290> had<00:02:43.290> had<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> run<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.640> her<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.630> side

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
her I and had had a run for her the side

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
her I and had had a run for her the side
of<00:02:45.930> her<00:02:46.110> body<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.710> focus<00:02:47.930> also<00:02:49.670> when<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
of her body out of focus also when I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
of her body out of focus also when I
composed<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.450> image<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.110> actually

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
composed this image when I was actually

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.780 
composed this image when I was actually
photographing<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> sea<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.430> was<00:02:53.580> getting

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
photographing the sea but I was getting

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.740 
photographing the sea but I was getting
really<00:02:53.970> close<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.750> her<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.640> trying<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
really close to her and and trying to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.510 
really close to her and and trying to
make<00:02:58.290> sure<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> i<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.040> eye<00:02:59.070> into

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
make sure that i can get the eye into

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.550 
make sure that i can get the eye into
one<00:02:59.970> third<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.660> image<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.230> I'll<00:03:01.320> show<00:03:01.500> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
one third of the image so I'll show you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.500 
one third of the image so I'll show you
what<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.800> rule<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:01.980> thirds<00:03:02.310> states<00:03:02.820> when<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
what the rule of thirds states when it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.360 
what the rule of thirds states when it
comes<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> composition<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> break<00:03:05.340> up

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
comes to composition so if you break up

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.320 
comes to composition so if you break up
an<00:03:05.760> image<00:03:06.150> into<00:03:06.590> three<00:03:07.590> equal<00:03:07.620> parts

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
an image into three equal parts

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.880 
an image into three equal parts
horizontally<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.590> vertically<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:13.740> will

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
horizontally and vertically you will

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.960 
horizontally and vertically you will
have<00:03:14.210> four<00:03:15.210> intersecting<00:03:15.900> points<00:03:16.440> where<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
have four intersecting points where the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.080 
have four intersecting points where the
where<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.000> lines<00:03:18.480> intersect<00:03:19.410> okay<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.850> I'll

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
where the lines intersect okay and I'll

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.270 
where the lines intersect okay and I'll
go<00:03:21.240> through<00:03:21.450> those<00:03:21.630> over<00:03:21.930> here<00:03:22.230> there's<00:03:22.830> one

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
go through those over here there's one

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.710 
go through those over here there's one
in<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.580> second<00:03:23.820> point<00:03:24.060> there's<00:03:24.420> another

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
in the second point there's another

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.900 
in the second point there's another
there's<00:03:25.080> another<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.160> there's<00:03:26.370> another<00:03:26.610> so

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
there's another and there's another so

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.080 
there's another and there's another so
where<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> lines<00:03:27.530> intersect<00:03:28.530> are<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.280> wood

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
where the lines intersect are the wood

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.060 
where the lines intersect are the wood
this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.080> where<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.410> want<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.710> point<00:03:31.980> of

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
this is where you want the point of

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.970 
this is where you want the point of
interest<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.780> image<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.320> we'll<00:03:34.860> get

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
interest to be in the image so we'll get

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160 
interest to be in the image so we'll get
rid<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.250> those<00:03:35.880> three<00:03:36.300> because<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.840> don't<00:03:37.020> want

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
rid of those three because we don't want

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.230 
rid of those three because we don't want
too<00:03:37.980> many<00:03:38.100> points<00:03:38.460> of<00:03:38.520> interest<00:03:38.820> we<00:03:38.940> only<00:03:39.060> won

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
too many points of interest we only won

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.630 
too many points of interest we only won
one<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.810> image<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.320> that's<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.280> zebras

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
one in this image and that's the zebras

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.550 
one in this image and that's the zebras
I<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:41.850> I've<00:03:43.370> barely<00:03:44.370> crop<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.850> image<00:03:45.000> it's

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
I so I've barely crop this image it's

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.700 
I so I've barely crop this image it's
almost<00:03:46.560> straight<00:03:46.890> off<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.070> camera<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:48.710> may

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
almost straight off the camera I may

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.100 
almost straight off the camera I may
have<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:51.030> chopped<00:03:51.300> off<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> little<00:03:51.780> bit<00:03:51.960> on

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
have just chopped off a little bit on

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.660 
have just chopped off a little bit on
the<00:03:52.230> left<00:03:52.440> or<00:03:52.620> right<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.160> make<00:03:53.370> sure<00:03:53.400> that

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
the left or right just to make sure that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.400 
the left or right just to make sure that
I<00:03:53.700> could<00:03:53.820> get<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.330> intersecting<00:03:54.990> point<00:03:55.230> all

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
I could get the intersecting point all

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.790 
I could get the intersecting point all
right<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.240> in<00:03:57.990> her<00:03:58.260> eye<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.770> a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
right in the in the in in her eye with a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.610 
right in the in the in in her eye with a
focal<00:03:59.250> point<00:03:59.280> where<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> want<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.620> okay

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
focal point where I want it to be okay

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.170 
focal point where I want it to be okay
so<00:04:02.160> get<00:04:02.340> rid<00:04:02.460> of<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.910> then<00:04:03.000> I'll<00:04:03.150> show

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
so get rid of that and then I'll show

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.660 
so get rid of that and then I'll show
you<00:04:03.420> also<00:04:04.260> what<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.440> did<00:04:04.710> in<00:04:04.860> Photoshop<00:04:05.430> was

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
you also what I did in Photoshop was

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.390 
you also what I did in Photoshop was
enlightened<00:04:06.270> her<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.660> little<00:04:07.080> bit<00:04:07.230> i<00:04:07.410> did

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
enlightened her I a little bit i did

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
have Sun streaming into I and that's why

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.500 
have Sun streaming into I and that's why
I<00:04:10.860> chose<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.160> image<00:04:11.610> but<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.850> did<00:04:12.030> lighten<00:04:12.390> it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
I chose this image but I did lighten it

I chose this image but I did lighten it
a<00:04:12.540> little<00:04:12.720> bit<00:04:12.960> so<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.650> can<00:04:13.740> get<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.160> of

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
a little bit so that I can get some of

the warm some of the yellows to come out

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.580 
the warm some of the yellows to come out
of<00:04:17.670> that<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.090> where<00:04:18.960> i<00:04:18.989> used<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.410> rule

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
of that so that's where i used the rule

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.140 
of that so that's where i used the rule
of<00:04:19.620> thirds<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:21.000> create<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:22.100> stunning<00:04:23.100> work<00:04:23.970> of
