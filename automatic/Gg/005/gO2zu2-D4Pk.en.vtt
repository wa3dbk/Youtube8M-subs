00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.900
 Eddie Guerrero is WWE champion 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.700
 Eddie Guerrero goes to Wrestlemania ¡¡ 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.600
 Eddie Guerrero did the unexpected 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.060
 I'm proud to represent WWE fans. 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.640
 And they want to know what I'm really proud of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 That I'm going to enter Wrestlemania ... 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.800
 ... the WWE champion. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 But you know what, Homes. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 I will also leave Wrestlemania as a WWE champion. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.420
 I'm back... 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.160
 You may like it or not, you deserve something better ... 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 ... they need a strong leader. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.940
 That will carry the flag of world champion ... 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.440
 ... with honor. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.323
 What you need ... 

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:17.263
 ... is a straight edge world champion. 

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:19.260
 And if they are not straight edge like me ... 

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.403
 .... that means I'm better than you. 

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:27.083
 Actually, this is what I believe ... 

00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:30.863
 You do not know if you can beat me, Homes. 

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:35.943
 That is the question that burns inside us ... 

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:39.203
 You do not know who is the best fighter ... 

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:40.263
 ... will you be? 

00:01:40.263 --> 00:01:41.383
 ... or will it be me? 

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:45.643
 I do not drink, I do not smoke, I do not use drugs ... 

00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.661
 ... and I have no plans to use them 

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:49.941
 All you have to do is look into my eyes 

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.613
 and realize that I laughed in the face of temptation ... 

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:54.593
 ...and again. 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.340
 I am stronger than any alcohol you can drink 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.620
 I'm harder than any line you inhale through your nose. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 And I'm sure I can harm you ... 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.480
 ... faster than any pill you put in your mouth. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.240
 No Homes! 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.960
 I'm defeating those demons ... 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.240
 ... I'm overcoming those obstacles. 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.480
 A guy like you could never beat me ... 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.940
 ... because I'm straight edge 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.580
 Every obstacle that was presented to me ... 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.940
 .... I have won. 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.220
 I will be the one who leaves on Sunday as WWE champion 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.160
 And there is no one in the world ... 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.500
 ... who can beat me at Wrestlemania! 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.273
 Maybe you're right... 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
 ... maybe I can not beat you ... 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.460
 But ... what if I can! "
