00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
was that's a little bit of fun I guess

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.810 
was that's a little bit of fun I guess
to<00:02:45.420> break<00:02:45.630> those<00:02:45.840> things<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.610> that's<00:02:50.610> about

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
to break those things and that's about

to break those things and that's about
it<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.540> don't<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.050> know<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.560> there's

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it I don't really know if I if there's

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.400 
it I don't really know if I if there's
any<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.490> spots<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.690> man<00:02:54.930> let's<00:02:55.170> see

any other spots on this man let's see
there's<00:02:56.310> one<00:02:56.580> little<00:02:56.700> overlooking<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.930> think

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
there's one little overlooking I think

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.350

this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.190> last<00:02:59.430> building<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.180> that's

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
this is the last building I think that's

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.090 
this is the last building I think that's
it<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it so there it is

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.870 
it so there it is
formats<00:03:02.760> being<00:03:03.120> previewed<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.160> worth<00:03:05.340> 15

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
formats being previewed is it worth 15

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.820 
formats being previewed is it worth 15

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
is also a zombie map I don't know if I'm

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.290 
is also a zombie map I don't know if I'm
gonna<00:03:07.980> try<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.310> out<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.520> might<00:03:08.790> try<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.180> on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
gonna try it out I might try it out on

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.060 
gonna try it out I might try it out on
