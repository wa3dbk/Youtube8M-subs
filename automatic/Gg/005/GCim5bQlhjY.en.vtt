00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
gay McDonald to Coco because what it

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.979 
gay McDonald to Coco because what it
does<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.000> weaves<00:03:44.329> it<00:03:44.510> into<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.810> main

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
does is it weaves it into the main

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.800 
does is it weaves it into the main
storyline<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.910> little<00:03:47.239> bit<00:03:47.480> just

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
storyline and it's a little bit just

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.930 
storyline and it's a little bit just
makes<00:03:48.140> sense<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.590> playing<00:03:49.250> as<00:03:49.430> Catwoman<00:03:49.850> is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
makes sense that playing as Catwoman is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.520 
makes sense that playing as Catwoman is
great<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:50.510> her<00:03:50.660> they've<00:03:50.930> really<00:03:51.230> got<00:03:51.380> the
