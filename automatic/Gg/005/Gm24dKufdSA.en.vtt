software and what I'm gonna do here is I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.100 
software and what I'm gonna do here is I
take<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.930> left<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.620> right<00:03:40.680> picture<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:42.110> select

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
take a left and right picture I select

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.710 
take a left and right picture I select
both<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.349> them<00:03:44.360> drag<00:03:45.360> them<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:48.480> then

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
both of them drag them in here and then

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.289 
both of them drag them in here and then
what<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.900> need<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:50.030> 3d<00:03:51.030> glasses<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:54.120> make

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
what I need is my 3d glasses to make

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.240 
what I need is my 3d glasses to make
adjustments<00:03:54.989> if<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:57.440> okay<00:03:58.440> let's<00:03:58.890> see

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
adjustments if I have to okay let's see

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.890 
adjustments if I have to okay let's see
for<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.329> particular<00:04:01.140> software<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:03.750> only

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
for this particular software you only

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.160 
for this particular software you only
need<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.260> change<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.040> X<00:04:05.599> where<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:06.720> because

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
need to change the X where you because

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.140 
need to change the X where you because
the<00:04:07.319> camera<00:04:07.620> doesn't<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.640> rotate<00:04:08.880> with

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the camera doesn't you can rotate with

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.569 
the camera doesn't you can rotate with
this<00:04:09.480> thing<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.590> all<00:04:10.709> kinds<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.130> stuff<00:04:11.250> you

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
this thing and to all kinds of stuff you

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.839 
this thing and to all kinds of stuff you
only<00:04:12.299> need<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.630> shift<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.620> x<00:04:13.950> value<00:04:14.400> left<00:04:14.610> and

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
only need to shift the x value left and

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.349 
only need to shift the x value left and
right<00:04:15.769> so<00:04:16.769> when<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.400> look<00:04:17.549> into<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.970> picture

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.670 

conceit<00:04:21.359> here<00:04:21.389> little<00:04:21.750> double<00:04:22.049> pictures<00:04:22.410> when

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
conceit here little double pictures when

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:35.400 
conceit here little double pictures when
you<00:04:22.770> click<00:04:23.340> here<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.729> right<00:04:25.639> closes<00:04:26.639> in

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.800 

so<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.440> basically<00:04:37.210> eliminated<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.330> ghosting

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
so I basically eliminated the ghosting

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.030 
so I basically eliminated the ghosting
for<00:04:39.110> those<00:04:39.290> two<00:04:39.620> bars<00:04:39.890> here<00:04:43.030> 2.0<00:04:44.030> 28<00:04:44.480> on<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.690> X

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
for those two bars here 2.0 28 on the X

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.460 
for those two bars here 2.0 28 on the X
now<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.310> look<00:04:46.520> at<00:04:46.730> my<00:04:46.760> with<00:04:47.720> my<00:04:47.870> class<00:04:48.140> system

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
now as I look at my with my class system

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.530 
now as I look at my with my class system
that<00:04:48.620> looks<00:04:48.830> pretty<00:04:48.980> good<00:04:49.250> already<00:04:49.540> so

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
that looks pretty good already so

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.450 
that looks pretty good already so
everybody<00:04:51.110> can<00:04:51.290> change<00:04:51.710> this<00:04:52.010> year<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.340> his

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
everybody can change this year to his

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.440 
everybody can change this year to his
liking<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:55.280> why<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.490> don't<00:04:55.880> need<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.060> change<00:04:56.270> up

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
liking the why I don't need to change up

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.210 
liking the why I don't need to change up
and<00:04:56.600> down<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.020> cameras<00:04:57.440> finish<00:04:57.770> table<00:04:58.100> with

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
and down the cameras finish table with

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.180 
and down the cameras finish table with
this<00:04:58.370> we<00:04:59.180> see<00:04:59.540> now<00:04:59.780> that<00:04:59.810> it<00:05:00.470> doesn't<00:05:00.710> overlap

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
this we see now that it doesn't overlap

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.760 
this we see now that it doesn't overlap
right<00:05:01.550> here<00:05:01.790> it's<00:05:02.540> very<00:05:02.780> easy<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.200> fix<00:05:03.410> we<00:05:03.620> go

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
right here it's very easy to fix we go

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.990 
right here it's very easy to fix we go
to<00:05:03.830> view<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.520> show<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.240> cropped<00:05:05.570> version<00:05:07.000> we

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
to view and show the cropped version we

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.460 
to view and show the cropped version we
can<00:05:08.210> experiment<00:05:08.780> with<00:05:09.350> different<00:05:10.270> glasses

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
can experiment with different glasses

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.730 
can experiment with different glasses
wear<00:05:12.470> blue<00:05:12.770> red<00:05:13.040> green<00:05:14.260> this<00:05:15.260> one<00:05:15.470> for<00:05:15.650> example

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
wear blue red green this one for example

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.340 
wear blue red green this one for example
changes<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> little<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.460> leave<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.850> like<00:05:20.030> this

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
changes a little so I leave it like this

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.020 
changes a little so I leave it like this
and<00:05:21.350> once<00:05:21.710> I'm<00:05:21.920> done<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:22.400> can<00:05:22.640> save<00:05:22.910> my<00:05:23.330> my<00:05:24.110> sure

so<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.560> repeat<00:05:56.860> this<00:05:58.560> let's<00:05:59.560> take<00:05:59.710> another<00:05:59.860> one

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
so to repeat this let's take another one

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.110 
so to repeat this let's take another one
let's<00:06:00.670> take<00:06:00.880> here<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.210> 107<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.850> have<00:06:03.850> to<00:06:03.970> select

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
let's take here the 107 I have to select

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.510 
let's take here the 107 I have to select
both<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:04.810> very<00:06:05.110> important<00:06:05.590> they<00:06:06.190> attract

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
both it is very important they attract

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.580 
both it is very important they attract
both<00:06:06.760> left<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.330> right<00:06:07.570> in<00:06:07.840> there<00:06:10.410> all<00:06:11.410> right

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
both left and right in there all right

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.540 
both left and right in there all right
now<00:06:12.990> we<00:06:13.990> can<00:06:14.140> see<00:06:14.320> without<00:06:14.500> glasses<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:15.400> we

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
now we can see without glasses that we

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.850 
now we can see without glasses that we
have<00:06:15.760> on<00:06:16.510> those<00:06:17.610> posts<00:06:18.610> here<00:06:18.910> a<00:06:19.320> lot<00:06:20.320> of

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.370 

shadows<00:06:24.210> now<00:06:25.210> I<00:06:25.240> can<00:06:25.540> move<00:06:25.690> here<00:06:26.080> left<00:06:26.230> and

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
shadows now I can move here left and
