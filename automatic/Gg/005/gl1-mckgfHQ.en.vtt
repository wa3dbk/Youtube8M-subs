00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.649 
controller charging stand wow there's a
lot<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> huge<00:01:31.259> power<00:01:31.560> brick<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
lot there's a huge power brick is the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
lot there's a huge power brick is the
largest<00:01:34.110> power<00:01:34.409> brick<00:01:34.680> I've<00:01:34.770> ever<00:01:34.950> seen<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
largest power brick I've ever seen for a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.770 
largest power brick I've ever seen for a
Nintendo<00:01:35.490> console<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:36.990> massive<00:01:37.369> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
Nintendo console it's pretty massive and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
Nintendo console it's pretty massive and
then<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.200> guess<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> power<00:01:41.729> supply

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
then I guess this is the power supply

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.620 
then I guess this is the power supply
for<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.930> charging<00:01:43.470> cradle<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.790> let's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
have that option out of the gate that's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
why they included the cable up front

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.780 
why they included the cable up front
here<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.140> Wii<00:02:34.320> consoles<00:02:35.010> front<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.670> got

here is the Wii consoles front you got
the<00:02:35.940> disc<00:02:36.180> slot<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.990> then<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.590> looks<00:02:37.800> like

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the disc slot and then it looks like

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.380 
the disc slot and then it looks like
there's<00:02:39.180> also<00:02:39.360> two<00:02:39.660> USBs<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.620> front<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.390> well

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
