Hey guys!! Today's trick is way known 'couse's very easy, usefull on the field as well,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.540
and can get you out of troubbles.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.280
Well, what we're gonna do to get this trick is very basic.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.120
Just stepping the ball on with the sole of our dominant foot.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.440
Once's that done, roll it backward and then step down in front of ball, on the side. This way:

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.940
...so we're comfortably able to turn around and run on that way.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.160
It'd be something like this, then; roll the ball backward, step down on the side, and once we're just like this,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.840
roll it on this way, using the sole of our non-dominant foot. Then, get the body spin over, .

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.860
and runing out at speed

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.120
This's a very good trick for using in front of the opponent.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.400
Having the trick done, we have to run out on the side.  Whether if you guy're right or left footed,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.520
pick the side fits better on you guys.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.920
If you are able to do this trick well both of your feet with,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.220
you can chose the side you wanna run out on, depending on the game situation.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.200
A faster example to clear this down, here. In front of the opponent:

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.460
roll the ball backward, step down, and dragging it out with the sole of the non-dominant foot.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.120
You probably miss this trick out at the beggining, 'couse you may want to do it quickly,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.380
and can't  get good coordination. So, as I always say in every trick: you sould do it slowly first,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.280
and as coordination and technique are getting well done, move on faster.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.800
Okie, guys, I hope you liked this tutorial. It's really very basics, very -on-the-field style.
