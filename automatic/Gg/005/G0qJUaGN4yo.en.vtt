00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
where the harmful UVA rays that you get

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
where the harmful UVA rays that you get
an<00:00:42.840> object<00:00:42.960> vices<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:44.489> instead<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
an object vices and when instead it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.260 
an object vices and when instead it
actually<00:00:45.420> takes<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> healthy<00:00:46.739> rays<00:00:46.950> and

actually takes the healthy rays and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
actually takes the healthy rays and
stimulates<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> collagen<00:00:49.050> growth<00:00:49.079> what

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
stimulates the collagen growth what

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
stimulates the collagen growth what
you're<00:00:50.070> scared<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.640> penetrate<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> deeper

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690

layers and as a result the overall skin
tone<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.780> theory<00:00:55.110> improves<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.449> wrinkles<00:00:57.449> are

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

when<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> three<00:01:50.790> minutes<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> simply

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
when the three minutes is up you simply

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
when the three minutes is up you simply
move<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> device<00:01:52.950> along<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.850> use<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
move the device along and you use it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.139 
move the device along and you use it
somewhere<00:01:54.600> else<00:01:54.979> might<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.969> at

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
somewhere else might want to think at

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.370 
somewhere else might want to think at
first<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.810> feel<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
first would that feel a little bit of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
first would that feel a little bit of
pain<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.460> I've<00:01:59.759> tried<00:02:00.060> other

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
pain and I know I've tried other

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
pain and I know I've tried other
machines<00:02:00.840> before<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> muscle<00:02:02.040> stimulation

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
machines before for a muscle stimulation

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.300 
machines before for a muscle stimulation
but<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.409> concentrate<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
but you have to really concentrate with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.459 
but you have to really concentrate with
those<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.240> one<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.990> don't<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> be

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
those with this one you don't have to be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.320 
those with this one you don't have to be
that<00:02:07.619> specific<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> end<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> day

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that specific so at the end of the day

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.479 
that specific so at the end of the day
sitting<00:02:09.780> down<00:02:09.959> watching<00:02:10.110> TV<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:11.190> actually

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
sitting down watching TV it's actually

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.890 
sitting down watching TV it's actually
quite<00:02:11.670> relaxing<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> think

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
quite relaxing you don't have to think

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
quite relaxing you don't have to think
that

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.100 
that
-<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.850> I've<00:02:14.970> noticed<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.930> put

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
- and what I've noticed is if you put

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.550 
- and what I've noticed is if you put
your<00:02:16.200> hand<00:02:16.440> against<00:02:16.800> PM<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.150> light<00:02:18.560> there's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
your hand against PM the light there's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.230 
your hand against PM the light there's
no<00:02:19.710> warmth<00:02:20.100> coming<00:02:20.370> from<00:02:20.460> there<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.000> it's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
no warmth coming from there at all it's

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
no warmth coming from there at all it's
just<00:02:21.300> cold<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.960> touch

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
just cold to the touch

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.920 
just cold to the touch
however<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.880> put<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> against<00:02:24.510> your<00:02:24.570> skin

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
however you put it against your skin

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
however you put it against your skin
towards<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> end<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> three<00:02:26.430> minutes<00:02:26.760> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
towards the end of the three minutes I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.210 
towards the end of the three minutes I
can<00:02:27.420> feel<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> walls<00:02:27.990> being<00:02:28.290> generated<00:02:28.770> which

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
can feel the walls being generated which

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
can feel the walls being generated which
I<00:02:29.310> think<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.910> why<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.090> actually<00:02:30.390> find<00:02:30.690> quite

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I think that's why I actually find quite

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.320 
I think that's why I actually find quite
relaxing<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.430> feel<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.700> walls<00:02:33.090> being

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
relaxing you can feel that walls being

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
relaxing you can feel that walls being
generated<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:34.350> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> impression

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
generated do kind of get the impression

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.490 
generated do kind of get the impression
is<00:02:35.610> doing<00:02:35.940> something<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:37.110> quite<00:02:37.290> know

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
is doing something I don't quite know

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830 
is doing something I don't quite know
what<00:02:37.710> I'm<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.250> at<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.460> beginning<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> using

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
what I'm just at the beginning of using

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.170 
what I'm just at the beginning of using
this<00:02:39.960> particular<00:02:40.140> device<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.610> see<00:02:41.790> any

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
this particular device and to see any

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.240 
this particular device and to see any
sort<00:02:42.420> concrete<00:02:42.900> results<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.740> really<00:02:43.860> need<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
sort concrete results you really need to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.950 
sort concrete results you really need to
be<00:02:44.370> using<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:45.000> eight<00:02:45.300> weeks<00:02:45.330> almost

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
be using it for about eight weeks almost

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.260 
be using it for about eight weeks almost
on<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> daily<00:02:46.320> basis<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
on a daily basis so this is the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.570 
on a daily basis so this is the
beginning<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> trial<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.350> try<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> keep

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
beginning of the trial and I try to keep

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.880 
beginning of the trial and I try to keep
you<00:02:50.640> updated<00:02:51.090> four<00:02:51.480> weeks<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.200> then<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.530> big

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you updated four weeks in and then a big

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.740 
you updated four weeks in and then a big
scene<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.210> hasn't<00:02:54.390> made<00:02:54.570> any

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
scene it really hasn't made any

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.280 
scene it really hasn't made any
difference

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
difference

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
difference
I'm<00:02:55.410> hoping<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.070> does<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.820> silent

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
I'm hoping it does because the silent

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.820 
I'm hoping it does because the silent
treatment<00:02:57.210> can<00:02:57.660> be<00:02:57.810> quite<00:02:58.020> expensive<00:02:58.260> but

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
treatment can be quite expensive but

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.070 
treatment can be quite expensive but
normally<00:02:59.220> anywhere<00:02:59.760> between<00:03:00.000> 40<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.630> 60

pounds a session whereas to buy this it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.860 
pounds a session whereas to buy this it
is<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.320> an<00:03:04.440> investment<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.520> 200<00:03:06.120> 250

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
is it is an investment it's 200 250

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.730

however<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:08.940> only<00:03:09.150> four<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.630> five

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
however that's only four or five

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.650 
however that's only four or five
sessions<00:03:10.140> never<00:03:11.040> sell<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.760> if<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.450> does

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
sessions never sell on so if it does

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.810 
sessions never sell on so if it does
work<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.410> can<00:03:13.740> actually<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.310> quite<00:03:14.550> an
