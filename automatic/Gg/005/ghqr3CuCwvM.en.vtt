series<00:00:53.210> I've<00:00:53.420> been<00:00:53.660> doing<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.050> for<00:00:54.290> like<00:00:54.550> 12

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550

weeks<00:00:56.059> straight<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:57.860> just<00:00:58.070> felt<00:00:58.520> like

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
weeks straight and I just felt like

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.030 
weeks straight and I just felt like
taking<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:59.090> break<00:00:59.300> from<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.960> might<00:01:00.260> come<00:01:00.980> back

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
taking a break from it I might come back

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.410 
taking a break from it I might come back
with<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:01.670> at<00:01:01.790> some<00:01:02.030> point<00:01:02.770> most<00:01:03.770> likely<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.189> will

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
with it at some point most likely I will

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.219 
with it at some point most likely I will
but<00:01:05.420> it'll<00:01:05.659> probably<00:01:05.990> be<00:01:06.380> once<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.930> as

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
but it'll probably be once the and as

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.469 
but it'll probably be once the and as
you<00:01:09.409> can<00:01:09.530> see<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.890> beautiful<00:01:10.330> counter<00:01:11.330> knee

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479

they're<00:01:12.220> beautiful<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:13.700> anyway<00:01:14.000> I'll

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
they're beautiful but anyway I'll

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.050

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
