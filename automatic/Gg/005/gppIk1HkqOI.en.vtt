who picked Alexander hagberg in with a

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.670 
who picked Alexander hagberg in with a
shot<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.540> making<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.019> podium<00:02:32.349> here<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
shot of making the podium here at the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.500 
shot of making the podium here at the
lrp<00:02:32.889> masters<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.639> mean<00:02:33.999> it's<00:02:34.120> pretty<00:02:34.239> close

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
lrp masters I mean it's pretty close

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.119 
lrp masters I mean it's pretty close
we're<00:02:34.780> all<00:02:34.900> within<00:02:35.230> two<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.560> three<00:02:35.650> seconds

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
we're all within two or three seconds

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.280 
we're all within two or three seconds
every<00:02:36.370> run<00:02:36.549> so<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.090> think<00:02:37.480> three<00:02:37.870> or<00:02:37.900> four<00:02:38.109> guys

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
every run so I think three or four guys

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.559 
every run so I think three or four guys
can<00:02:38.530> win<00:02:38.950> probably<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:39.819> for<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.450> looks

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
can win probably as for now it looks

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.030 
can win probably as for now it looks
like<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.049> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.379> between<00:02:41.680> Ronald

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
like it's going to be between Ronald

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.550 
like it's going to be between Ronald
mark<00:02:42.430> me<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:42.879> maybe<00:02:43.540> Freddie<00:02:43.870> suit<00:02:44.109> up<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.439> an

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
