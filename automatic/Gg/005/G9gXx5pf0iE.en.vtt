00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
exploiting your way and one of the ways

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.680 
exploiting your way and one of the ways
were<00:00:52.160> dueling<00:00:53.160> mhm<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.210> running<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.350 
why blizzard did not release this
underground<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.000> old<00:02:38.630> iron<00:02:38.870> forge<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
underground the old iron forge in the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.780 
underground the old iron forge in the
original<00:02:41.360> patch<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.080> mean<00:02:42.230> patch<00:02:42.470> 4.3<00:02:43.190> point

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
original patch I mean patch 4.3 point

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.030 
original patch I mean patch 4.3 point
this<00:02:44.920> 4.0<00:02:45.920> point<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:48.410> pretty<00:02:48.799> weird

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
this 4.0 point a and that's pretty weird

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.190 
this 4.0 point a and that's pretty weird
but<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.420> last<00:02:51.200> they<00:02:51.470> are<00:02:51.850> finally<00:02:52.870> making<00:02:53.870> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
but and last they are finally making it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440 
but and last they are finally making it
public<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.739> I<00:02:55.160> believe<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.579> has<00:02:55.610> something<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
public and I believe it has something to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.630 
public and I believe it has something to
do<00:02:56.630> with<00:02:56.840> Ragnar<00:02:57.230> recipe<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:57.980> fire<00:02:58.310> lines

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
do with Ragnar recipe and fire lines

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.800 
do with Ragnar recipe and fire lines
being<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.090> next<00:02:59.390> patch<00:02:59.860> him<00:03:01.060> my<00:03:02.060> guess<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.540> he

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
being the next patch him my guess is he

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.080 
being the next patch him my guess is he
is<00:03:02.959> going<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.500> attack<00:03:03.829> us<00:03:04.100> on<00:03:04.280> Damien<00:03:04.640> sort<00:03:04.940> of

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
is going to attack us on Damien sort of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.840 
is going to attack us on Damien sort of
through<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.630> old<00:03:05.959> iron<00:03:06.170> forge<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.340> who<00:03:07.489> knows
