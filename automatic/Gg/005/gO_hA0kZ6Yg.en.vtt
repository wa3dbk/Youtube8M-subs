00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820
 Hello dear friends in touch 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.890
 Alexey Kuzmichev 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.180
 and in this little video I want to show 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.349
 you the possibility of a new set of actions 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.480
 which allows you to create very 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.330
 beautiful and interesting vintage effects 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.649
 for your photos 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.720
 before we start let's 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.480
 let's refresh a little bit in our memory 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.020
 called action action if someone forgot 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.880
 action this is in advance prepared by us 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.190
 Photoshop action sequence 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.340
 there is an example you have processed some 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.620
 photo recorded all their actions 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.980
 Photoshop as remembered in the future 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.150
 can already without your participation 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.700
 handle photos by this 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.240
 the algorithm is very convenient allows 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.250
 save 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.840
 very large amount of time and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.780
 many professional photographers 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.329
 use this tool in their 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.590
 work well and now let's 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:12.320
 let's see how to work with this set 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.869
 go to the action panel and i'm 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.619
 I have an installed set here 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.889
 and choose the example here any action 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.869
 let's take vintage 13 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:25.700
 we start it as you see I absolutely 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.969
 doing nothing just sitting and watching 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.580
 photoshop automatically processes in 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.840
 my photo 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.840
 let's wait a little 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.950
 Well, as you can see the photos are processed 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240
 I have created here automatically 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.400
 adjustment layers 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.120
 who added a beautiful vintage 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.180
 the effect on my photo is all here 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.650
 fully customizable that is if you 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.660
 some kind of adjustment layer is not 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.360
 satisfied you can either remove it 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.090
 either adjust the transparency for it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.590
 to reduce or strengthen this or that 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.290
 Effect 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.270
 for example, you can try to change 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.000
 transparency top conditions as you can see 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.320
 my shadows get colder if you 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.060
 like more so you can leave 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.390
 transparency at 80 percent if not 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.850
 like lower to the desired effect 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.030
 in such a way also possible 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.580
 adjust fully the whole effect to 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.130
 this we need to combine all here 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.290
 these layers into a group 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.020
 select the top layer hold down the key 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.530
 shift and select the bottom layer click 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.600
 combination kontrol g on the keyboard and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.640
 so we grouped all the layers 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.790
 which we have created an action in a separate 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.660
 folder how to see his house photo and now 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.630
 processed 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.060
 if we need a little loosen 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.730
 For example, the effect we lower the transparency 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.510
 this group also up to the one we need 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.700
 result example to 80 percent effect 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.280
 a little bit weaker as you see 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.200
 and we spent all about everything 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.540
 just one minute 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.120
 in the same way you can choose 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.810
 absolutely any action from this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.819
 collections 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.569
 as you can see here we have them 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.760
 quite a lot again 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.280
 I repeat that all the action here is completely 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.830
 customizable with them is very very easy 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410
 work so that you do not get confused I 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.450
 recorded a few for you 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 video lessons which showed how 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 set action and how with them 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.099
 work 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.250
 they are all waiting for you in the archive along with 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.440

 where you can also see an example 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
 action processing is also a bit 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.160
