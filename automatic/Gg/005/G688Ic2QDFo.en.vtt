your feet what would you do there you go
right<00:07:03.760> okay<00:07:04.090> that's<00:07:04.270> frequency<00:07:04.810> that's<00:07:04.930> how

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
right okay that's frequency that's how

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.660 
right okay that's frequency that's how
fast<00:07:05.410> your<00:07:05.710> feet<00:07:05.920> go<00:07:06.100> up<00:07:06.220> and<00:07:06.340> down<00:07:06.460> on<00:07:06.520> the

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
fast your feet go up and down on the

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.360 
fast your feet go up and down on the
ground<00:07:06.850> and<00:07:07.150> what<00:07:07.720> stride<00:07:08.020> length<00:07:08.290> how<00:07:09.100> far

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
ground and what stride length how far

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.450 
ground and what stride length how far
you<00:07:09.550> are<00:07:09.640> away<00:07:10.000> yard<00:07:10.780> oh<00:07:11.320> yes<00:07:11.860> guy<00:07:12.100> that's

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
you are away yard oh yes guy that's

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.430 
you are away yard oh yes guy that's
right<00:07:12.640> that's<00:07:12.910> right<00:07:12.970> so<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.450> combination<00:07:14.050> of

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
right that's right so the combination of

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.740 
right that's right so the combination of
speed<00:07:14.800> is<00:07:15.460> stride<00:07:15.970> length<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:16.540> stride

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
speed is stride length and stride

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.940 
speed is stride length and stride
frequency<00:07:16.930> if<00:07:17.260> you<00:07:17.350> can<00:07:17.500> lengthen<00:07:17.680> your

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
frequency if you can lengthen your

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.190 
frequency if you can lengthen your
stride<00:07:18.280> and<00:07:18.580> increase<00:07:19.390> the<00:07:19.600> cadence<00:07:19.990> or

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.200 
stride and increase the cadence or

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.380 
stride and increase the cadence or
increase<00:07:20.590> the<00:07:20.710> frequency<00:07:20.890> you<00:07:21.730> go<00:07:21.850> faster

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390 
increase the frequency you go faster

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.460 
increase the frequency you go faster
okay<00:07:24.030> lean<00:07:25.030> over<00:07:25.300> those<00:07:25.480> legs<00:07:25.780> there<00:07:26.200> you<00:07:26.320> go
