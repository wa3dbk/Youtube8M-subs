00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.099
 so hi to all and write 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 that takes 1.3 so today we get 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.000
 found for a new video on 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 khalti black of the so I hope that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.330
 you are all very well 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 me it was great so so today 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.359
 I'm alone I'll show you 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 so a little elite what's going on 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.160
 in on the local transit I'm going to put 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 face they can that's it's that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 to be original it's gone I launch the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.860
 part so then it's a say so who 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.260
 consists of one that serves so to see the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.260
 laser gun a so black ops 2 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 on the wall by against this rich so do not 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 not walk every time we will say 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.660
 that he walks one time out of three so good 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.260
 after it is a richie serves a lot 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.519
 so not for people who appreciate the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 laser gun one so so I say the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.570
 laser gun bread because on iah he 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 there are two laser guns so it's up to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 say so our tracks and r1 so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 that of black ops 1 and the bust and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.290
 kira laser new air gun 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.130
 so that was added during the year 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.320
 during an update that so 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.719
 beguiled as the laser gun or who 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.670
 get the green right we'll say but 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.770
 who shoots in three balls by three 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.009
 banner that I find is much better 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:45.579
 than what lasers 1 that after I 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.679
 afraid I never liked it already 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.689
 indie laser gun so we see 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.069
 perfect I already have to wait until 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:57.840
 this case the sleeve 3 the lava appear 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:00.429
 once the lady has finally appeared 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.229
 I had to wait for round 4 and a 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.909
 times the sleeve four finishes the heart 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.189
 I advise you not to take 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.610
 ammunition from Olympia directly 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:13.810
 but rather to wait 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.819
 let's kill some zombies that are 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.510
 on fire or why on fire I know 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.420
 no and it's better to kill zombies 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.130
 on fire you go why pay no more 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.540
 walk but there is no longer you have 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.459
 have more luck that works 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.200
 so I know what and so basket a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.190
 once you will have come fire 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.150
 nine because as I said everything to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.069
 time is a slide so I'm 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.620
 one in three looks there the fire is going 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.480
 appear when you retrieve your 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.100
 olympia ammunition the laser gun 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.739
 go out before the wall but you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.739
 will have the laser gun instead of 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.989
 the olympia so here it is true that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.510
 it's a lot and then he 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:04.720
 lava that will soon appear so 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.960
 so I kill them until the sleeve 3 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.080
 finally until the end of the round 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.670
 and so I who will show his flop so 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.990
 so here I am going to tell you something 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.510
 which I saw here is the chain ten 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.680
 as I say so every time in 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.960
 my videos I know I'm repeating myself 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 it's not huge 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.730
 we are already at 132.5 view 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.470
 I believe nine good subscribers then like 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.430
 jose who every time I know it's 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.140
 not a lot but that's it for a chain 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.880
 which is not that you're saying that I 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.260
 repeat I know but jean ping who is 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.820
 not known frankly I'm really 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:51.820
 angry especially that now I have the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.210
 green gelatine media so that's it 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.160
 is calvet sleeve killed some zombies 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.830
 on fire and so normally I'll have my 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.210
 little surprise so as I said to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.580
 the time is not sure and certain then 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.560
 I hope the sound quality does not 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:15.000
 to break life because in front of him 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.620
 matt is lived because there I remedy 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.230
 do not register so are I do not know 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.040
 not why 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.250
 yet I have already managed to do 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.810
 record her I do not know too much I know 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.900
 not sure why he will record the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
 so are good after it does not matter 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.780
 I hope the sound quality is not 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.350
 for us so here I killed 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:43.590
 in fact so in normally I am 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.860
 still what grain bil'in I'm going 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.979
 atlantic reaction 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.500
 I'm going to finish the round 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.979
 can sometimes have to wait 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.229
 a little 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.729
 so presto I advise you to kill 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:07.780
 when i house bis who are on fire 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:07.780
 it increases the songs nait his 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:17.220
 game I move away a little bit so we 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.870
 will try who take on that one 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.790
 here and I hope I will have 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.170
 here is my heart as we can see 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.500
 so I have my laser gun 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:37.500
 so here it is very useful so for 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.940
 zombie so here I did that 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.800
 works well then after I'm going to buy 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.990
 ammunition to show you that 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.880
 really you have no ammunition 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.600
 Unlimited I show you until that 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.570
 cost the ammunition so that's 500 so 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.010
 that's it's insane nothing look like 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:06:02.790
 she earns 50 parizon bitu and I have more 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:06.270
 of 870 beats so I think I have the 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:10.290
 time to get me to these points for for 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.800
 to have 500 so that's it then I hope that 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.810
 this video that you will have liked then I 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.820
 just show you right now that's 1,260 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.930
 here it works really good because as 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.640
 I read just now after this time 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:30.810
 on two good shots do not hesitate to 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:35.090
 insist on killing zombies so who who 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.350
 are your big fires so that's it 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.010
 I hope it's a little tutorial where you 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.300
 will have lower at least I tell you to the 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.300
 next world
