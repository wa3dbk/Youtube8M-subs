00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.890
 99 and welcome to this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 I would like to tutor you today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 Show how you like these gadgets on the edge 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 you can install you can setup 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 for example, like others 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.369
 graphics card just instructor 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.130
 busy and first time stands for it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.600
 I use for the video card gpu 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 meter and for a processor as 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.260
 kilometers they load down no long ago 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 description 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:54.250
 so you only have to do it once 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:55.930
 short double-click as well as and 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.610
 already installed are the chamber 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.159
 Clear 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.720
 which in itself already placed here 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.000
 if that is not the case it must be about it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.619
 right click on the desktop and make 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 then you go here on mini applications 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:13.710
 there you see all the gadgets doubt 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.680
 and of course there are many 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.770
 many more 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.179
 For example , he shows speedfan meter 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.229
 like me with my pc components 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.600
 wolf the plus not set 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.520
 For example, cpu usage is the default 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.759
 there are always windows 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.170
 you do not have to download extra and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.360
 then you can go back to this one 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 Maintain option and that bit 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 if you tell me for example 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 also the functional not 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.420
 here it was at the ten 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 miles you can now or the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.689
 temperature can be displayed 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.399
 but you also need it yourself 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.290
 program code shirt or pc meter and the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.860
 would have to run in the background that is 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.750
 So practically yes you can indeed the new ones 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.050
 processor see which clock rate the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 right now i'm running from the work spokesman 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.110
 just needed and how the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.019
 single cores are busy speaking 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.950
 that's what you rough, for example 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.090
 here could have seen and that but 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.209
 a little bit smaller 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.810
 up here for the graphics card gpu clock 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:48.580
 piece not now temperature from vices 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 fan speed yes i hope so 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.920
 could help you with that and until the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920
 next time
