00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.880
 in half an hour will be recorded lópez uma 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 but he's not winning chicago fuck in 20 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.460
 football minutes first arrival of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 chicago and the one that enables is activating 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.230
 we will have to see the repetition but 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.619
 relevant enables and activates a large 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.440
 service the control is excellent and the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.360
 definition of core is 1 to 0 not that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 be fair in football there is no 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 justice you have to make the goal as soon as 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.600
 in what way for yourself 10 girls 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:57.490
 in america 11 at 25 it is said that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.160
 goals is usually a combination 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.790
 of success and error seems to go here 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.280
 in the sangüesa service the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.310
 defense including the goalkeeper's turn and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.400
 they fail and that is very well take advantage very 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 all right 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.560
 the defense after the goalkeeper can not 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.560
 do absolutely nothing the first 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.680
 because it's a play where segares 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 wrong and not enough 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.800
 to rectify does not reach to take off 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 doing with him and with back 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.570
 and let's see the repetition is color 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.100
 well clear but the referee is not the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.590
 what marks the assistant marks the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.330
 referee was covered is very clear the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.630
 criminal and very well the system now 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.630
 find something else that is not shown 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.080
 currently so we can say that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 come here 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.820
 between the cole de alarcón 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.990
 tiger woods and logan el cabos america 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.850
 the 63 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.910
 not with much force 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.830
 with placement I think he touches it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.760
 I'll know that if I reach it to touch 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.770
 With a lot of cold blood the Bermúdez Hobbit 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.350
 the mouth the archer the cat that the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.790
 archer not enough to deflect it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.610
 to get it out to corner shot there 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 we are watching the repetition and overtaking 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.480
 the defender and on the second play he 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360
 ends by taking a waist 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.720
 clear penalty tony lopez the same the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 center forward 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 for your team 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.170
 well as I take it 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.930
 I know it 's better with your head than with 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.750
 the feet but at this time do not say 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.790
 nothing 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.140
 to see late and that was very close before 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.520
 from this prison to the hobbit bermúdez 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.520
 if you manage the arc 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.800
 all right 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.140
 America 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.920
 to finish we said that we wanted more 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.260
 goals 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.990
 there is changes his direction 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.840
 goalkeeper is thrown for his side 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.660
 left and tony lópez runs to the post 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.420
 and in 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.000
 very well the back the defender there is no 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.150
 coverage because it came out there pimentel him 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.920
 they end up winning the back easily 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.050
 the player from america and then before the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.260
 departure from lopez very well mcdonald for 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.260
