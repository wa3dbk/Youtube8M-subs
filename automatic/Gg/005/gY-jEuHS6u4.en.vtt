00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
for I don't know about a week I think

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.020 
for I don't know about a week I think
it's<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> die<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.700> plants

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it's going to die that was the plants

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
it's going to die that was the plants
not<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.840> fully<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
not really fully good right now is it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.950 
not really fully good right now is it
still<00:00:41.610> under<00:00:41.850> stress<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> transfer

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
still under stress from the transfer

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
still under stress from the transfer
from<00:00:43.140> soil<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.649> water<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.129> guess

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
from soil or water this is my I guess

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
from soil or water this is my I guess
you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.640> call<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.120> system<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you can call it some system when it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340 
you can call it some system when it
rains<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> water<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.239> goes<00:00:51.239> through<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
rains the water just goes through this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
rains the water just goes through this
tube<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> overflows<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> hole<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
tube and overflows out of the hole I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.110 
tube and overflows out of the hole I
drilled<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:56.160> helps<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> water

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
drilled on it helps I can see the water

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660 
drilled on it helps I can see the water
level<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.079> keeps<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> where<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
level and it keeps it where I want it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
level and it keeps it where I want it
here's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> closer<00:01:00.750> view<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:03.799> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
here's a closer view right here I just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.109 
here's a closer view right here I just
marked<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> line<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.790> drilled<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> hole

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
marked the line and then drilled a hole

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.420 
marked the line and then drilled a hole
I<00:01:06.540> mean<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.770> far<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.100> worked<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.369> pretty

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
I mean so far it's worked out pretty

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
I mean so far it's worked out pretty
good<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.570> future<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.470> um<00:01:10.770> an

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
good in the future I want to get um an

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
good in the future I want to get um an
opaque<00:01:12.060> -<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.170> had<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:13.979> get

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
opaque - I just have had time to go get

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:14.539 
opaque - I just have had time to go get
one

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
one

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.950 
one
so<00:01:15.000> algae<00:01:15.360> doesn't<00:01:15.630> grow<00:01:15.780> inside<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> tube

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so algae doesn't grow inside the tube

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.539 
so algae doesn't grow inside the tube

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.630 

and<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.900> my<00:02:26.049> air<00:02:26.319> hose<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> pump

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
and this is my air hose I have a pump

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880 
and this is my air hose I have a pump
running<00:02:27.880> from<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:28.209> garage<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:29.590> straight<00:02:29.769> out

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
running from my garage just straight out

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
running from my garage just straight out
of<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.040> garage<00:02:30.209> it's<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> commercial

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
of my garage it's just the commercial

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.670 
of my garage it's just the commercial
air<00:02:32.049> pump<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.180> puts<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.810> about<00:02:34.959> 70

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
air pump I think it puts out about 70

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
air pump I think it puts out about 70
litres<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> minute<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> pretty<00:02:37.150> big<00:02:37.329> one

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
litres a minute so it's a pretty big one

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.170 
litres a minute so it's a pretty big one
I<00:02:37.540> could<00:02:37.780> probably<00:02:37.930> run<00:02:38.140> about<00:02:38.549> 10<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.790> 15

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I could probably run about 10 to 15

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.550 
I could probably run about 10 to 15
