00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 I'm happy because I'm driving the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.250
 medina gómez and also with the owls and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 all these divine designs of owls in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 the expo was really spectacular 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.089
 you saw all the things you can do 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 everything everything everything that can be done to 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.539
 people fascinated him apart is the last 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.089
 fashion the issue of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 everyone has owls whatever 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.489
 be 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.189
 that's why we wanted to make a program 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.480
 complete so all this good 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.010
 can really make some idea 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 get me out with all the materials with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 all the more they have worked with all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 the materials somehow if we go 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.899
 to talk and talk but I also love 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.269
 because for the kitchen it carries ladles or 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.059
 whatever you really want to do 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.239
 You can decorate pieces in wood very 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.519
 easy with sheets with guards and also 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 We can give you formits so we're going to 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.339
 start working and good and in addition 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.339
 congratulate you 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:25.010
 with your English currency and let's start 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.410
 with another good 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.120
 the effect is passed to the piece 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.740
 self-adhesive to stick the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.890
 blades and obviously that we are going to use 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.350
 the plates that have owls and that back 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.510
 has a grid yes so that is this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.400
 because I want to show other things 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.930
 pass the glue and I already said dry to 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.080
 point of dying I touch is dry 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.510
 see that I will directly support the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.310
 lamina stretch there we go for the second 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.130
 side sheet here 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.390
 to every time I do not do what I do not place 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.060
 If then today guards the guards 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.890
 let's put then are some guards 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.220
 self-adhesive then 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.520
 and we are going to cut the surplus 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.880
 that is the idea of ​​combining clear 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.130
 so easy, exactly, a role that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.770
 we have it stamped that we have it with 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.810
 the drawings then what we do we are going to 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.360
 put a paper out there not so 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.020
 worked if this grid is with a 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 gang but not as worked as the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.110
 that we have in the front if you already 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.800
 I'm slowly taking out all the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.520
 surplus there then equal if we 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.959
 there is a surplus left if it is paper 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.330
 ends with the sandpaper 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.300
 we would have to remove with the sandpaper this 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.700
 part if it 's here I would be there if I wanted to 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.100
 could give as finished we have some 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.950
 guards that are self-adhesive that good 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.780
 the guards come straight like that but I 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.709
 I want to make them more fun and the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.510
 Cut with a very good whistle scissors 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.610
 with pique scissors is good with the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.860
 piquitos scissors with punching machines 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.959
 you have to start innovating with the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.670
 guards with sheets with papers 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.670
 because we will use the paper to 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.610
 A lot of things 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.400
 and here to make it funnier 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.700
 a guard dividing it with the scissors 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.590
 of piquitos if we are going to use the part 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.700
 this obviously has to be fine 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.700
 cortadito well 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.409
 mos above as adhesive 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.810
 sticks perfectly on the sheet there 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.040
 you see that we continue to enrich the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.420
 work there short the surplus this what 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.280
 I keep it because for something it's going to serve 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.599
 exactly the little part above 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.719
 finite part that I did to 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.530
 purpose one wider and one finite 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.180
 so I can paste it up and I'm going to paste 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.810
 this little bit here because I love you 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.239
 show other things I brought some ideas 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.870
 so that the girls begin to play 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:17.269
 a little more with the plates 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:22.290
 there is that I give it a termination if 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.120
 short short of the other side good here 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.340
 obviously I will continue with the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.229
 little part of here up with the other 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.479
 lateral but one thing that I wanted 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.750
 show you herme that sometimes girls 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.970
 they say to me and I already painted it what I do 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.790
 paste paper if you can paste paper 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.330
 I brought another piece here that would be like that 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.400
 finished but on the acrylic too 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.000
 we can pay to paste the sticker and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 re-renew it by seeing what we paste 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.460
 the mission happens that we have at home if 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.139
 You are in wood, you paint 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.169
 you want to renew the one you want 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.360
 recycle you see that I passed the effect 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.180
 the self - adhesive effect of glue what 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.270
 let dry he pointed love listener 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.270
 or 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.360
 directly the sheet above if I go back 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.580
 to cut everything here in the same way as 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 We did earlier and in addition it is used a lot 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.050
 all the theme of little flowers that you see there 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.970
 a lot of techniques that come a bit 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.010
 of scrapbooking is that I was seeing if 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.440
 the scrapbooking theme of putting you 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.360
 guard and is puntillita paper of all 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.460
 the bits you saw that I was telling you 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.320
 we are not going to throw we grab any 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.840
 die -cutter these are from little flowers and 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.450
 look how nice this is to paste 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.520
 also combine here what I did was 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.530
 take out the little flowers that we are now 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.170
 decorating like this but here I am left 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.110
 template that could also of corias 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.520
 hit and see exactly then at 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.470
 sheets when I cut and cut the 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.480
 little flower with a bolillo I give myself a 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.220
 little movement nothing else there if not 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.650
 I had a roll with the little part of 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.770
 behind some redondito brush look 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.030
 how easy it is on a cloth there already 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:14.070
 I give him a move 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:18.270
 What I did was paste a combine with 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:22.530
 a color with a vinyl glue I put 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:26.460
 a little bit there in the middle support one that 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:29.010
 make contrast I put another bit of 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.820
 some vinyl glue and I can 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.220
 put glitter 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.860
 and there with visitation and obviously that this 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.010
 you will use it to decorate where you like 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.620
 with this for example this spoon 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.210
 on the sheet what we did is 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.340
 put a product a varnish 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.070
 dimensional so you have another touch 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.580
 more is always embellish and add 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.080
 add you let's go a little bit all 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.570
 the chicharreros look at the amount of 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.090
 spoon of the boxes everything for the kitchen 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:04.020
 It's great that the theme of the 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.690
 color was a round program yes I think 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.940
 that there are all the different secrets 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.800
 for all the secrets for all and with 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.569
 the theme of the games that really 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:19.069
 passionate so a program 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:22.999
 thank you very much for the support that we 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.999
 we have a little kiss
