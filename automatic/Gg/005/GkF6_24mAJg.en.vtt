00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:06.039
 all efforts and exertions in advance have paid off the move to 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:10.169
 the de Marina, the construction during the week and the volunteer help of the SVG 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.049
 members 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.329
 With united forces one has the best wrestler in Germany 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.669
 Environment brings that merit 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.749
 and even before the fight began, the fans were safe 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.130
 for the role he's talking about his job 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 It is likely to achieve the law 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.800
 a lot of value throughout the season 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.669
 the rich 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.669
 their own 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 and they should be right 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 but before the things entered the mat, the finale became a worthy setting 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.909
 weigh with official 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.150
 Dance inserts and the national anthem created 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.830
 shortly before the start of the fight then Wagemann coach Frank Heinzelbecker indeed 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.440
 Optimistic when they want the rematch to be lightly 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.270
 to take 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.040
 It is quite another way, even the German master to be already 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 the Austrian a role 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.050
 After all, he wants the city Weingarten truck role 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.180
 From the beginning, everything went according to plan for the project championship 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.830
 Although Lukas Höglmeier lost the first fight of the evening with the 3 2 points 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 Victory in the extension of Johannes Kessel 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.180
 Bolze the SVG Express 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.850
 because the mood in the wm-arena for the first time brought to a boil 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 important partial success was achieved 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.540
 In the ensuing fight for Muslims, they become the local hero and are on the way 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.960
 Top performer Marcel Ewald for the 2-defeat 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.759
 he still lost in the Aschaffenburg frankenstolz arena with 2 to 3 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.850
 he dominated his fight from the beginning he sees in the end sovereign with 3 1 2 0 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.810
 yes i did last week so far it says excellent 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.030
 that all went optimally referee was loud at was 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.290
 difficult situation and I just wanted to win 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.760
 for the November team from the preliminary round as well 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.620
 for the shot come 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.330
 Braun that went well I have his call running 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.920
 then be running 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.620
 also for the next two fight let for the SVG athletes 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.660
 in the weight class up to 96 kilograms the reigning Fietze won the world championship 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.000
 Meloni now mobile routinely with 3 to 1 and already prematurely that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.559
 dancing feet 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.159
 as well as Cioni Pommery clearly without difficulty the victory 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.030
 technical superiority import 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.770
 Mason the body language of the athletes already foresee that it is full to only 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
 would give a winner 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.879
 With Steiner 13 to six lead, it was then in the half-time break 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.070
 also Heribert Rech Minister of the Interior of Baden-württemberg 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.919
 sporting highlight not to be missed 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.319
 and showed himself in the half and runs expertly 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.459
 so it was sporty to park the car with three segments of the world 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.139
 fair 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.889
 I've seen a great team effort so far from SV Germania 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.359
 as in old times, 20 25 years remained at standards in the Bundesliga race 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.319
 just was her home Greiss was this time on the scales sometimes 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.279
 German champion as it looks quite as if percent of Paul's party 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.729
 just turned 25 years later a German champion 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.199
 in the second half then a similarly dominant played the man 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.520
 Dercon repeatedly copied his success from the fight 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.039
 and won again with 3 to 1 points against Bembel Salpeter Weißenburger 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.669
 in the next fight the early decision for the SVG could be made 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.289
 Sahin Prince René never really got into the fight 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.899
 So had to accept the Ringer maximum penalty in the fourth round 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.779
 Victory by shoulders was the end result for Saber volatil from the RWG 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.399
 Decision initially adjourned the German Films and that is 4g storage 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.689
 Frank Heinzelbecker 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.739
 After the next fight, I finally had the certainty that it would be enough 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.639
 Although it took until the fifth round before Dennis Zimmermann finally sack 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.449
 were closing 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.849
 but then the Germans were no longer entitled to the championship 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.369
 take 17 to 11 led them in the standings and with the 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.579
 five-point cushion from the fight they were thus no longer catch up 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.919
 the project mastery in the dm-arena two succeeds 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.379
 and the fans were excited 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.669
 the two following battles were only formal in nature 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.930
 Veteran Adam Juretzko played out his superiority 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.720
 and Sarah headed by the overall win a 14 o'clock takes place through 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.440
 technical superiority 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.220
 that the last fight of the evening will be lost then no one interested 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.030
 because finally all dams broke and the joy was given free rein 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.999
 calmly 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.989
 Champagne shower exuberant mood cheers in the complete wm-arena us one 

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:43.360
 consistently satisfied that Germanic camp 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.180
 Assure result 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.180
 22 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 in the end, these were supposed to be the best team 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.840
 For a long time, however, Westerwald was one year old 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.360
 across Europe, it was set by the British 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.710
 and he was happy 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.759
 we have gone ten years 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.119
 he did not make any mistake on an exhibition everybody got their performance 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:10.240
 All have been given their best, he lives from 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.120
 At the beginning of the first half, everything goes according to plan and even better 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:19.279
 but little slip-up at the site was but such a car events 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.610
 the perfect with the kids of my boys it was all hell going on during the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.470
 Award ceremony was the joy barely in check 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.210
 as last year against Ahlen in the final still the failing 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.810
 the SV Germania Weingarten was now on the river and arrived with 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.250
 Scott armed with all her trophy 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.210
 Did the wrestlers know whom to thank? 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.850
 and so the object of desire also made its rounds in the summer camp 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.480
 until it arrived again with the sporty winners of the evening the 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.990
 then celebrated well into the morning with fans friends and 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.920
 Family in the Klever Italians their championship
