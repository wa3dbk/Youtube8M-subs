00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
let you know at the end ok now why would

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
let you know at the end ok now why would
you<00:00:43.200> need<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> replace<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.129> wood<00:00:44.340> trim<00:00:44.520> as

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you need to replace this wood trim as

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
you need to replace this wood trim as
you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.899> located<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you can see it's located right in the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.569 
you can see it's located right in the
center<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> dash<00:00:48.980> with<00:00:49.980> high<00:00:50.129> visibility

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
center of the dash with high visibility

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.380 
center of the dash with high visibility
so<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.190> cracked<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:54.890> peeling<00:00:56.390> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so if you're just cracked or peeling it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
so if you're just cracked or peeling it
definitely<00:00:57.809> gives<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.170> interior<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:59.010> bad

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
definitely gives your interior a bad

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.900 
definitely gives your interior a bad
look<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.039> reason<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.640> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
look so that's one reason there it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.109 
look so that's one reason there it's
just<00:01:03.180> visual<00:01:03.830> ok<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.189> this<00:01:08.189> example<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
just visual ok so in this example we

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.190 
just visual ok so in this example we
gone<00:01:09.240> ahead<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> remove<00:01:09.810> pretty<00:01:10.049> much
