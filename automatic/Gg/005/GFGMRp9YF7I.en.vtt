I'm taking my CD and placing a white

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.170 
I'm taking my CD and placing a white
circle<00:03:23.829> on<00:03:23.919> top<00:03:24.159> before<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.549> put<00:03:24.760> on<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:24.970> yellow

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
circle on top before I put on the yellow

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.059 
circle on top before I put on the yellow
felt<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.959> reason<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:26.379> doing<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.739> here<00:03:26.979> is

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
felt the reason I'm doing this here is

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.800 
felt the reason I'm doing this here is
because<00:03:27.250> my<00:03:27.430> yellow<00:03:27.819> felt<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.239> thin<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.720> I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
because my yellow felt is thin and I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.469 
because my yellow felt is thin and I
don't<00:03:28.870> want<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.229> CD<00:03:29.439> to<00:03:29.650> show<00:03:29.829> through<00:03:30.479> for

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
don't want the CD to show through for

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.089 
don't want the CD to show through for
the<00:03:31.599> face<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:32.019> all<00:03:32.199> of<00:03:32.319> these<00:03:32.470> images<00:03:32.739> what<00:03:33.069> I

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
the face for all of these images what I

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.679 
the face for all of these images what I
recommend<00:03:33.609> doing<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:34.030> before<00:03:34.419> you<00:03:34.510> glue

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
recommend doing is before you glue

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.539 
recommend doing is before you glue
everything<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.260> position<00:03:36.040> them<00:03:36.189> onto<00:03:36.400> your

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
everything on position them onto your

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.039
