00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 us in the match of the specific of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.929
 tomorrow we will try to go on the pitch 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 anyway as we have always done with 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.780
 drawing on resources on which maybe 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 we may have worked with 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.050
 maybe different features e 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
 trying to go and create thoughts e 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 to our opponents 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 we are aware of having to work 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.460
 so much because it is clear that we still have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 in front of us growth margins e 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 at the same time as said before there 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.100
 we have yet to complete but so are we 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 we have changed we have changed because if 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 let's check with respect to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 last year there are no nine anymore 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
 players so the reality is this e 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 so we put nine new ones in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 last year's rose group 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 so it is clear that gods have arrived 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.719
 guys that very young still someone 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 other will have to arrive as we already have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.950
 said in advance so let's wait 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 to see no bowls when it will be 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.990
 all this phase of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 market 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 how many we will be who we will be and then we will be able 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.300
 to evaluate 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.430
 this too costs our wish 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.490
 that of being able to redo a championship 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.480
 just nice fun where we can 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.560
 put on display and enhance the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.510
 our players park 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.800
 let's go ahead what will be from 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.900
 Doing society in the current knows this 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.690
 therefore it is moving in this direction 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.480
 so we remain focused on 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.920
 field to the championship and we try to do 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.450
 our best in these first 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 days to check in short 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.670
 what our journey will be 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.710
 It is clear that the will of society is 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.900
 obviously consequently greater 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.270
 reason on my part as a technique 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.640
 was to have already in the moment in 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.970
 which one came out already to have at least 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.860
 what was already here ready for a 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.130
 available but it was not possible 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 do it so let's look at the next ones 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.600
 days and above all let's focus on the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.060
 tomorrow's match because we expect a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.590
 very difficult opponent with very good 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.780
 quality a team that plays together from 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.450
 more years with the same gasperini technician 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.170
 is good we know it then it will take 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.209
 a game 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.980
 in short, thickness in this respect 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.489
 we will surely have a lot to do 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.530
 careful organized and go 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.239
 to try to propose also what is 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.820
 our game and do it the way 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.620
 better with conviction than with all 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.770
 those characteristics that we are 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.770
 constructed
