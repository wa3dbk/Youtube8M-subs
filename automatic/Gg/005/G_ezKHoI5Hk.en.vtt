00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:13.820
 The legal pyre is more in the person nor am I 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.820
 dani lighter skin closed the rout 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.010
 bruno koech is nothing more than a video for you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.080
 This is it. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 I found this crowded village 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 I went to attack but I was alone with archs. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 barbarians and servants result miserable 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 That's why I was very sad. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 I got to take all that kick. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.739
 wonderful 600,000 drive 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.559
 I got enough and let's say 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.739
 so, but look, there 's what despair 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.239
 What a neurosis bitch who did not get 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 do what I wanted to do 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 In that middle of that village I did not take 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 spells had no heroes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.219
 This is the farm life of every day at 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.590
 Sometimes it happens that you get very pissed 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.079
 but beauty sold 1 bonfÃ¡ mizinho ali 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.270
 to me it's compared to me 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.229
 I spent and that's what this is the day to day 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 clashes that are looking for something and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.049
 in the daily farm but that's it I did not have 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.920
 luck this time I walked in I still 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.600
 because he had not taken a giant the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 heroes inspired by general heroes 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 come back and I ended up speeding 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.470
 production of the archers of the barbarians 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 the servos to be able to train more 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 so I earn in quantity but at 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950
 times appear in the villages so 600 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 elixir batteries 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 and then it happens to be very sad 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 Why can not you not? 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.530
 No way and get in that middle 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 of that village then I 'm sure 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 I would have gone by air if I had 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.369
 It took a giant out for example to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.000
 open the way with the breaking walls with 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.329
 sure you would have sought those is to exist is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.540
 that these 400,000 elixir that were 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.159
 there in the middle is was very frustrating because 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.079
 I still can not try to get that 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.020
 that he was there to see if 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.840
 I could increase the theft of give 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.590
 but it was not great either 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.870
 thing 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.480
 the frustration really was not having 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.299
 edu take not having taken troops will power 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.739
 get in that middle of the village but that's it 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.209
 there it is right 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.260
 Then we'll get our lives here. 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.299
 with 300 of each going back in an old 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.569
 or the barbarians from one end to the other 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.489
 sliding there and the wallets behind 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.920
 the same way he 's coming back 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.019
 gradually there the servants in villages 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 abandoned so it's very good guy leaves 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.450
 taking the whole resource from the outside 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.170
 what a beauty 300 thousand without much effort 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540
 without using heroes without spending 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.989
 energy no worries 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.950
 very good, right? 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.569
 thought 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.489
 so sometimes you have that 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.409
 clumsy not to have troops 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.450
 enough or good troops to be able to 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.549
 invade a village and take all that 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.530
 which had previously been the 600 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.420
 thousand but in the sequence you see a scene 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.510
 Here's what makes you. 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.829
 continue to epharma this way tofa 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.010
 arming that not a crazy who is a 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.180
 there is delayed and the following is 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.099
 helping too much 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.410
 I already put my son here as a slave. 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.870
 So that's it. 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.000
 now it's going to be a good evolution that's it 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.769
 just to show you some of what 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.169
 can happen if you do not bring troops 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.540
 Then you can happen to get a life. 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.579
 of the crowded and can not enter more 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.889
 on the other hand you can make and 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.230
 same amount you lost a farm 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.190
 daily making beauty faster one 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.190
 hug, I went
