rectangular face that a 5600 has the

rectangular face that a 5600 has the
digits<00:02:29.060> also<00:02:29.390> look<00:02:29.570> better<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:30.680> better

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
digits also look better not better

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.530 
digits also look better not better
bigger<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.550> they<00:02:34.550> call<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.910> as<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.390> see

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
bigger this is they call this as you see

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
bigger this is they call this as you see
up<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.230> solar<00:02:36.470> watch<00:02:36.800> but<00:02:37.100> it's<00:02:37.220> a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
up here it's a solar watch but it's a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.160 
up here it's a solar watch but it's a
see<00:02:37.550> how<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.730> says<00:02:37.940> wave<00:02:38.150> scepter

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
see how it says wave scepter

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.960 
see how it says wave scepter
this<00:02:39.590> watch<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.130> production<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.790> don't

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
this watch is out of production I don't

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.120 
this watch is out of production I don't
know<00:02:41.090> when<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.450> watch<00:02:41.690> stopped<00:02:42.440> being<00:02:42.980> in

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
know when this watch stopped being in

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.350 
know when this watch stopped being in
production<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.000> been<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> couple

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
production I think it's been a couple

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
production I think it's been a couple
years<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:45.020> think<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.350> watch<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:45.740> only<00:02:45.920> out

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
years I think this watch was only out

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.449 
years I think this watch was only out
for<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.280> couple<00:02:46.550> years<00:02:46.580> but<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.370> a

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
for a couple years but this is this is a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.520 
for a couple years but this is this is a
multiband<00:02:50.000> -<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:53.030> syncs<00:02:53.690> up<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.080> tower<00:02:54.350> in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
multiband - so it syncs up to a tower in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.900 
multiband - so it syncs up to a tower in
the<00:02:54.590> United<00:02:54.860> States<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.370> then<00:02:55.489> one<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.760> Japan

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the United States and then one in Japan

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.979 
the United States and then one in Japan
so<00:02:57.430> yeah<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.850> would<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.180> pointless<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.660> people

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
so yeah it would be pointless for people

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.530 
so yeah it would be pointless for people
in<00:03:00.050> Europe<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.440> stuff<00:03:00.770> but<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.239> United

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
in Europe and stuff but in the United

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.790 
in Europe and stuff but in the United
States<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.620> pretty<00:03:03.860> much<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.160> same<00:03:05.800> it

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
States so it's pretty much the same it

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.350 
States so it's pretty much the same it
doesn't<00:03:07.070> matter<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.370> me<00:03:07.400> if<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.820> multiband

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
doesn't matter to me if it's a multiband

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.870 
doesn't matter to me if it's a multiband
five<00:03:08.630> or<00:03:08.840> six<00:03:09.080> all<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.800> need<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.340> calibrate

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
five or six all I need is the calibrate

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.540 
five or six all I need is the calibrate
time<00:03:11.060> calibration<00:03:11.630> in<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> United<00:03:12.050> States<00:03:12.550> so

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
time calibration in the United States so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.800 
time calibration in the United States so
if<00:03:13.730> we<00:03:13.850> take<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.270> look<00:03:14.390> at<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.570> watch

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
if we take a little look at this watch

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.660 
if we take a little look at this watch
we<00:03:15.140> got<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> lot<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.620> functions<00:03:16.160> on<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.459> watch

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
we got a lot of functions on this watch

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.000 
we got a lot of functions on this watch
similar<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.760> gwm<00:03:19.780> 5600<00:03:20.780> or<00:03:20.930> gwm<00:03:21.470> 56

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
similar to like the gwm 5600 or gwm 56

has an auto light feature of course it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.420 
has an auto light feature of course it
never<00:03:52.519> doesn't<00:03:52.940> want<00:03:53.060> to

wrist but um if you tilt this towards

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.280 
wrist but um if you tilt this towards
your<00:04:04.970> face<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.390> does<00:04:05.599> have<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.780> auto<00:04:06.019> light

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
feature which is really nice if we go

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.539 
feature which is really nice if we go
through<00:04:09.739> our<00:04:09.799> modes<00:04:10.099> right<00:04:10.340> here<00:04:11.769> we<00:04:12.769> have<00:04:13.040> our

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
through our modes right here we have our

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.280 
through our modes right here we have our
other<00:04:13.670> time<00:04:14.000> zone<00:04:14.390> I've<00:04:14.690> got<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.930> set<00:04:15.140> to

there's this like crisscross Ridge you
can<00:04:56.930> see<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.260> along<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.620> bottom<00:04:57.800> too<00:04:58.930> there

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
can see it along the bottom too there

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.490 
can see it along the bottom too there
you<00:05:00.080> go<00:05:00.699> kind<00:05:01.699> of<00:05:01.789> see<00:05:01.940> it<00:05:02.030> there<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:03.260> then<00:05:03.410> you

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
you go kind of see it there and then you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.620 
you go kind of see it there and then you
can<00:05:03.590> see<00:05:03.770> on<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:03.979> inside<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.729> this<00:05:05.060> part<00:05:05.389> there

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
can see on the inside of this part there

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.100 
can see on the inside of this part there
we<00:05:05.750> go

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
we go

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.589 
we go
this<00:05:07.099> just<00:05:07.340> makes<00:05:07.520> this<00:05:07.669> watch<00:05:07.880> extremely

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
this just makes this watch extremely

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.779 
this just makes this watch extremely
comfortable<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.050> wear<00:05:09.260> thus<00:05:10.099> making<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.610> like

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
comfortable to wear thus making it like

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.850 
comfortable to wear thus making it like
why<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.150> said<00:05:11.510> beginning<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.199> video<00:05:12.320> really

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
why I said beginning of the video really

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.650 
why I said beginning of the video really
good<00:05:13.070> daily<00:05:13.430> wear<00:05:15.849> yeah<00:05:16.849> it<00:05:17.150> might<00:05:17.300> not<00:05:17.449> be<00:05:17.539> the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
good daily wear yeah it might not be the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.050 
good daily wear yeah it might not be the
most<00:05:17.690> appealing<00:05:18.199> watch<00:05:18.530> but<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.310> don't<00:05:19.880> know<00:05:19.940> on

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
most appealing watch but I don't know on

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.180 
most appealing watch but I don't know on
the<00:05:20.180> wrist<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.599> also<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:21.380> looks<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.680> lot<00:05:21.830> smaller

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
the wrist it also it looks a lot smaller

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.560 
the wrist it also it looks a lot smaller
than<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.550> does<00:05:22.789> when<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.030> actually<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.419> it

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
than it does when you actually have it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.879 
than it does when you actually have it
on<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.750> wrist<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.289> when<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.500> have<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.710> on<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
on the wrist so when you have it on the

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:33.180 
on the wrist so when you have it on the
wrist

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.500 

it<00:05:34.190> definitely<00:05:34.370> looks<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.760> same<00:05:34.940> size<00:05:35.210> I

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
it definitely looks the same size I

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.149 
it definitely looks the same size I
think<00:05:35.570> I<00:05:35.900> looked<00:05:36.199> up<00:05:36.349> the<00:05:36.530> measurements<00:05:36.860> on

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
think I looked up the measurements on

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.550 
think I looked up the measurements on
this<00:05:37.310> I'm<00:05:37.490> pretty<00:05:37.669> sure<00:05:37.970> this<00:05:38.780> is<00:05:38.930> exactly<00:05:39.080> the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
this I'm pretty sure this is exactly the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.000 
this I'm pretty sure this is exactly the
same<00:05:39.770> size<00:05:40.099> as<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.080> standard<00:05:42.080> 56<00:05:42.620> hundreds

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
same size as the standard 56 hundreds

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.300 
same size as the standard 56 hundreds
but<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.610> think<00:05:43.820> there's<00:05:44.000> just<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.270> couple

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
but I think there's just a couple

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.800 
but I think there's just a couple
differences<00:05:46.310> in<00:05:46.580> how<00:05:46.699> the<00:05:46.729> screen<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.419> to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
differences in how the screen is to

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.850 
differences in how the screen is to
where<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.169> makes<00:05:48.409> it<00:05:48.530> look<00:05:48.680> a<00:05:48.740> little

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
where it makes it look a little

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.960 
where it makes it look a little
different<00:05:51.159> yeah<00:05:52.159> this<00:05:52.340> is<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:52.639> is<00:05:52.699> a<00:05:52.820> nice

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
different yeah this is this is a nice

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.990 
different yeah this is this is a nice
watch<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.510> wear<00:05:53.680> as<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.770> daily<00:05:55.220> wear<00:05:55.430> if<00:05:55.880> you

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000

watch to wear as a daily wear if you
don't<00:05:56.150> care<00:05:56.389> about<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.900> getting<00:05:57.110> dinged<00:05:57.349> up<00:05:57.500> or

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
don't care about it getting dinged up or
