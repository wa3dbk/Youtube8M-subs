00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
millimeter allen key and go ahead and
just<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.299> what<00:01:15.299> you're<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.600> doing<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
just that what you're actually doing is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
just that what you're actually doing is
adjusting<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.950> tension<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> spring<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
adjusting the tension of the spring so

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
adjusting the tension of the spring so
by<00:01:18.840> turning<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:20.010> bringing<00:01:20.400> more

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
by turning it right you're bringing more

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
by turning it right you're bringing more
pressure<00:01:20.970> into<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> group<00:01:21.720> head<00:01:21.930> right

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
pressure into the group head right

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.080 
pressure into the group head right
so<00:01:23.670> once<00:01:24.630> you've<00:01:24.810> adjusted<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:26.090> from

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so once you've adjusted that from

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
so once you've adjusted that from
factory<00:01:27.479> setting<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:28.020> thirteen<00:01:28.440> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
factory setting it's about thirteen to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
factory setting it's about thirteen to
fourteen<00:01:28.710> bars<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> bring<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> down

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
fourteen bars you want to bring it down

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
fourteen bars you want to bring it down
to<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.450> nine<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> ten<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.890> that's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to about nine to ten and that's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.250 
to about nine to ten and that's
generally<00:01:32.630> one<00:01:33.630> full<00:01:34.049> turn

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
generally one full turn

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.900 
generally one full turn
left<00:01:36.600> ok<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.380> once<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.650> have<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.830> go<00:01:39.730> ahead

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
normally and just go ahead and brew your

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.040 
normally and just go ahead and brew your
shot<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> wait<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.570> build<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.930> to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
shot and wait for it to build up to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.720 
shot and wait for it to build up to
enough<00:02:17.320> pressure<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.250> what<00:02:18.490> you'll<00:02:18.640> notice

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
enough pressure and what you'll notice

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.340 
enough pressure and what you'll notice
is<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.270> you've<00:02:19.480> actually<00:02:19.630> reduced<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
is that you've actually reduced the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.660 
is that you've actually reduced the
pressure<00:02:21.150> from<00:02:22.150> where<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.390> started<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.670> from

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
pressure from where you started and from

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
pressure from where you started and from
that<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.000> kind<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.330> gauge<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.900> readjust

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that you can kind of gauge and readjust

that you can kind of gauge and readjust
accordingly
