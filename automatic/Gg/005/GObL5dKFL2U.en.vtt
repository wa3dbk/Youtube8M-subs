00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.580
 that appears from a few times 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.340
 we just came through here 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.459
 pvda for a specific date 15 years 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.589
 to go 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.439
 i say 7 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:13.979
 7 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.490
 the incident would be violated the substantive agreements led by year 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 heijmans one 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.689
 stands for 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.489
 stay in the seaside town 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.510
 camara 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.830
 what is and what is allowed 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.579
 this is two days 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 but behind 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.080
 every year it means that the second quarter 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.810
 how much money goes out on fire 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.120
 any karin brewers 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 the previous owners 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.320
 please explain 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.490
 that was a shock 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.440
 the direction 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 continues to last the casting value 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 35 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.070
 hence 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.980
 because true 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.990
 director 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 only louder which in turn nobody dr 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 this was rewarded with effect from 2 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 nokia 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 it would be useful but few would live 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.250
 run annually 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 I maintain that none of the two remain 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.250
 but takes place every month 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.350
 that's necessary 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.060
 That has 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.829
 why not a few days away
