like<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.480> see<00:03:23.690> here<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.230> use<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:25.070> rubber<00:03:25.400> band

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
like you see here and use a rubber band

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.790 
like you see here and use a rubber band
to<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.120> make<00:03:26.330> sure<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.780> preseason<00:03:27.290> tax

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
to just make sure that the preseason tax

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.100 
to just make sure that the preseason tax
because<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.400> may<00:03:28.670> unravel<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.930> would

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
because it may unravel and it would

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.070 
because it may unravel and it would
really<00:03:30.320> suck<00:03:30.440> if<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.120> grabbing

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
really suck if you do this with grabbing

this<00:05:17.020> great<00:05:17.500> I'm<00:05:17.860> gonna

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
this great I'm gonna

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.550 
this great I'm gonna
lift

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.959 

keep<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.100> there

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
keep that there

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:45.430 
keep that there
if<00:05:27.059> that

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:54.850 

laughs<00:05:46.070> it<00:05:46.250> around

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.890 

and<00:05:54.979> just<00:05:55.699> for<00:05:55.849> security<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.509> can<00:05:56.659> throw<00:05:56.870> a

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
and just for security you can throw a

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.839 
and just for security you can throw a
couple<00:05:57.229> more<00:05:57.439> pins<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:57.889> there<00:05:58.069> I<00:05:58.280> think<00:05:58.580> a

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
couple more pins in there I think a

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:09.159 
couple more pins in there I think a
maximum<00:05:59.599> i<00:05:59.719> use<00:05:59.930> about<00:06:00.789> five<00:06:01.789> things

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.869 

and<00:06:09.259> when<00:06:09.949> you<00:06:10.039> do<00:06:10.219> them<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.580> should<00:06:10.610> probably

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:10.879 
and when you do them you should probably

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.740 
and when you do them you should probably
use<00:06:11.270> some<00:06:11.599> black<00:06:12.439> pins
