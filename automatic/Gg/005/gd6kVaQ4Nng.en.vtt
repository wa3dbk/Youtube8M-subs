this is gonna be the next blind eye the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.410 
this is gonna be the next blind eye the
third<00:00:57.370> one<00:00:57.610> in<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:57.880> area<00:00:58.240> right<00:00:58.360> here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
third one in this area right here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.590 
third one in this area right here
probably<00:00:59.550> not<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.730> last<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:01.210> it'll<00:01:01.420> be<00:01:01.480> the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
probably not the last one it'll be the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.590 
probably not the last one it'll be the
last<00:01:01.720> one<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.110> year<00:01:02.290> but<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.500> think<00:01:03.540> when<00:01:04.540> I

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
last one this year but I think when I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.080 
last one this year but I think when I
come<00:01:04.839> back<00:01:04.989> out<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.640> get<00:01:06.759> active

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
come back out and really get active

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.649 
come back out and really get active

put some up on that that Ridge up there
over<00:01:13.720> there<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.900> probably<00:01:17.260> right<00:01:17.410> up<00:01:17.530> in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680

over there and probably right up in
there<00:01:17.830> somewhere<00:01:18.040> because<00:01:19.830> those<00:01:20.830> offer<00:01:21.100> a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
there somewhere because those offer a

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.280 
there somewhere because those offer a
pretty<00:01:21.430> good<00:01:21.610> vantage<00:01:21.790> point

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
proof that we can do it this one's got a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.800 
proof that we can do it this one's got a
little<00:02:28.530> bit<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.950> natural<00:02:29.100> cover<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.630> whole

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
here that are gonna but I think I'm

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680 
here that are gonna but I think I'm
hoping<00:02:37.319> if<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.890> kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.420> got<00:02:39.569> my

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
hoping if I just kind of if I got my

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.090 
hoping if I just kind of if I got my
camel<00:02:40.110> right<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.799> I'm<00:02:40.980> hanging<00:02:41.420> back<00:02:42.420> here

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
direction should be pretty well covered

up I got a couple of fall back sort of

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.509 
up I got a couple of fall back sort of
positions<00:03:49.139> when<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.319> finally<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.889> get<00:03:50.159> it<00:03:50.310> get

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
positions when I finally do get it get

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.209 
positions when I finally do get it get
out<00:03:50.549> here<00:03:50.879> but<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:51.900> thinking<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.500> because<00:03:52.950> I'll

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
out here but my thinking is because I'll

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.720 
out here but my thinking is because I'll
be<00:03:53.340> camping<00:03:53.549> out<00:03:53.849> here<00:03:53.879> and<00:03:54.859> I'll<00:03:55.859> be<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.219> we

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
be camping out here and I'll be up we

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300 
be camping out here and I'll be up we
before<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> Sun's<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.689> I'll<00:03:58.409> be<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.829> I'll<00:03:59.159> get

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
before the Sun's up I'll be and I'll get

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.160 
before the Sun's up I'll be and I'll get
my<00:03:59.430> pick<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.790> whichever<00:04:00.060> blind<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.599> want<00:04:00.840> so

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
my pick of whichever blind I want so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.740 
my pick of whichever blind I want so
given<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.909> know<00:04:02.939> depending<00:04:03.359> on<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.510> wind

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
given the you know depending on the wind

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.050 
given the you know depending on the wind
direction<00:04:04.040> based<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> prevailing<00:04:05.849> winds

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
direction based on the prevailing winds

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.300 
direction based on the prevailing winds
I<00:04:06.359> think<00:04:07.109> we<00:04:07.230> should<00:04:07.409> be<00:04:07.530> all<00:04:07.650> right<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.220> know

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
I think we should be all right you know

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.949 
I think we should be all right you know
the<00:04:08.459> winds<00:04:08.700> are<00:04:08.790> squirrely<00:04:09.239> or<00:04:09.419> if<00:04:09.810> they're

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the winds are squirrely or if they're

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.259 
the winds are squirrely or if they're
shifting<00:04:10.579> we'll<00:04:11.579> come<00:04:11.760> up<00:04:11.790> with<00:04:11.939> a<00:04:12.060> different

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
shifting we'll come up with a different

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.080 
shifting we'll come up with a different
plan<00:04:12.450> but<00:04:13.340> right<00:04:14.340> now<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.519> think<00:04:14.639> we<00:04:14.849> got<00:04:14.969> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
plan but right now I think we got the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.319 
plan but right now I think we got the
basics<00:04:15.389> covered<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.349> we<00:04:16.500> got<00:04:16.650> three<00:04:17.329> debris

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
basics covered and we got three debris

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.129 
basics covered and we got three debris
blinds<00:04:18.599> up<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:21.209> more<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.449> think<00:04:21.570> about<00:04:21.840> it

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
blinds up and the more I think about it

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.290 
blinds up and the more I think about it
the<00:04:22.199> more<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.410> think<00:04:22.500> about<00:04:22.830> adding<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.300> that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the more I think about adding that that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.980 
the more I think about adding that that
cloth<00:04:25.160> blind<00:04:26.160> sort<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.729> panel<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.780> pretty

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
cloth blind sort of a panel it's pretty

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.930 
cloth blind sort of a panel it's pretty
long<00:04:28.199> I<00:04:28.380> think<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.680> six<00:04:28.949> seven<00:04:29.340> feet<00:04:29.460> long<00:04:29.520> so

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
long I think it's six seven feet long so

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.700 
long I think it's six seven feet long so
it'll<00:04:30.150> go<00:04:30.210> around<00:04:30.360> probably<00:04:31.050> three<00:04:31.289> sides<00:04:31.530> on

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
it'll go around probably three sides on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.070 
it'll go around probably three sides on
one<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.860> those<00:04:32.330> three<00:04:33.330> sides<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.990> those

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
one of those three sides of one of those

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.560 
one of those three sides of one of those
the<00:04:34.409> blinds<00:04:34.740> that'll<00:04:35.310> cover<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.610> lower<00:04:36.090> part

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the blinds that'll cover the lower part

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.070 
the blinds that'll cover the lower part
of<00:04:36.599> me<00:04:36.750> from<00:04:36.930> say<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.830> waist<00:04:38.039> down<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.960> got<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
of me from say the waist down I got the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.080 
of me from say the waist down I got the
sticks<00:04:40.349> to<00:04:40.470> break<00:04:40.650> up<00:04:40.800> my<00:04:40.919> outline<00:04:41.280> I'm<00:04:41.909> gonna

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
sticks to break up my outline I'm gonna

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.020

places that I position those I think I

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.879 
places that I position those I think I
think<00:04:48.630> my<00:04:48.750> odds<00:04:48.900> are<00:04:49.080> pretty<00:04:49.199> good<00:04:49.470> then<00:04:49.800> I'll
