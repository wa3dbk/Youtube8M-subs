I<00:00:14.310> not<00:00:15.310> even<00:00:15.550> learned<00:00:15.850> the<00:00:16.090> seven<00:00:16.630> modes

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
I not even learned the seven modes

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.290 
I not even learned the seven modes
within<00:00:17.800> that<00:00:17.980> C<00:00:18.220> major<00:00:18.400> scale<00:00:18.640> I<00:00:18.790> want<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.119> talk

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
within that C major scale I want to talk

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.350 
within that C major scale I want to talk
to<00:00:19.450> you<00:00:19.570> about<00:00:20.050> what<00:00:20.440> makes<00:00:20.650> them<00:00:21.040> a<00:00:21.369> minor<00:00:22.029> or

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
to you about what makes them a minor or

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.140 
to you about what makes them a minor or
a<00:00:22.390> major<00:00:22.540> mode<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.320> how<00:00:24.070> they<00:00:24.430> get<00:00:24.610> some<00:00:25.029> of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
a major mode and how they get some of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.800 
a major mode and how they get some of
the<00:00:25.240> distinctive<00:00:25.810> sounds<00:00:26.520> now<00:00:27.520> what's<00:00:28.420> really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
the distinctive sounds now what's really

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.430 
the distinctive sounds now what's really
important<00:00:29.410> is<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.890> 1<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:31.360> 3<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:31.990> 5<00:00:32.199> of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
important is the 1 the 3 and the 5 of

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.890 
important is the 1 the 3 and the 5 of
each<00:00:32.559> mode<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.520> gives<00:00:33.760> it<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.030> notes<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.720> the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
each mode it gives it the notes of the

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.160 
each mode it gives it the notes of the
tone<00:00:35.170> centers<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.550> if<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.449> was<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.870> first

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
tone centers and if I was in the first

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.660 
tone centers and if I was in the first
mode<00:00:38.379> C<00:00:38.680> major<00:00:43.830> one<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:44.979> three<00:00:45.159> and<00:00:45.309> five<00:00:45.460> at

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
mode C major one and three and five at

00:00:45.670 --> 00:01:02.250 
mode C major one and three and five at
the<00:00:45.699> first<00:00:46.000> note<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.559> third<00:00:47.589> note

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.710 

all<00:01:02.410> right<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.829> that's<00:01:02.980> why<00:01:03.129> C<00:01:03.489> Ionian<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.689> a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
all right and that's why C Ionian is a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.010 
all right and that's why C Ionian is a
major<00:01:05.080> mode<00:01:05.409> if<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.400> went<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.820> D

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.590 

that's<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.890> D<00:01:15.130> Dorian<00:01:15.490> mode<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.240> minor

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
that's a D Dorian mode this is a minor

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.480 
that's a D Dorian mode this is a minor
mode<00:01:16.899> and<00:01:17.259> it's<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.560> minor<00:01:17.799> mode<00:01:18.040> because<00:01:18.369> if

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
mode and it's a minor mode because if

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.980 
mode and it's a minor mode because if
you<00:01:18.579> go<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:18.970> three<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.360> five<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.810> that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
you go to one three and five of that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:35.700 
you go to one three and five of that
scale

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.310 

so<00:01:36.400> that's<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.670> D<00:01:36.910> Dorian<00:01:37.570> mode<00:01:37.960> which<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.290> a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
so that's a D Dorian mode which is a

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800 
so that's a D Dorian mode which is a
minor<00:01:38.740> mode<00:01:39.070> that's<00:01:39.310> why<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.580> gets<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:40.030> distinct

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
minor mode that's why it gets a distinct

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.850 
minor mode that's why it gets a distinct
sound<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:42.310> as<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.760> minor<00:01:43.090> mode<00:01:43.720> let's<00:01:44.530> go<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.710> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
sound of as a minor mode let's go to the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.670 
sound of as a minor mode let's go to the
third<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.340> which<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.520> e<00:01:45.910> Phrygian<00:01:46.620> now<00:01:47.620> the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
third one which is e Phrygian now the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.260 
third one which is e Phrygian now the
first<00:01:47.950> third<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.250> fifth<00:01:48.400> notes<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.090> one

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
first third and fifth notes of that one

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:59.469 
first third and fifth notes of that one
are<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.740> third<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.520> mean

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.660 

that's<00:02:00.200> also<00:02:00.469> a<00:02:00.619> minor<00:02:00.920> mode<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.310> Phrygian

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
that's also a minor mode the Phrygian

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.249 
that's also a minor mode the Phrygian
mode<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.909> minor<00:02:02.119> mode<00:02:02.299> because<00:02:02.539> your<00:02:02.659> route

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
mode the minor mode because your route

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.880 
mode the minor mode because your route
minor<00:02:04.219> third<00:02:08.410> next<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.769> eighth

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
minor third next we have the eighth

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:23.820 
minor third next we have the eighth
Lydian<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:11.239> it's<00:02:11.800> here<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.580> then<00:02:14.300> one<00:02:17.739> that's

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.540 

we<00:02:52.830> go<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.600> Aeolian

lastly we have the the B Locrian mode

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:20.730 
lastly we have the the B Locrian mode
starts<00:03:12.610> at<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.760> B<00:03:15.690> third<00:03:16.690> no<00:03:18.060> no<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:20.440> one<00:03:20.620> we

starts at the B third no no this one we

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.580 
starts at the B third no no this one we
have<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> room<00:03:21.480> Maya<00:03:22.480> third

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
so those are the the arpeggios that go

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.990 
so those are the the arpeggios that go
with<00:03:37.510> every<00:03:38.080> one<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.560> modes<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.310> let<00:03:39.940> me

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.789 
with every one of the modes and let me
play<00:03:40.120> them<00:03:40.390> it's<00:03:40.659> a<00:03:40.750> good<00:03:40.900> exercise<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.590> so
