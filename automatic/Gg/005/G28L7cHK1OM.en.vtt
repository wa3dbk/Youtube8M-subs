multiplayer gameplay this is footage of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279 
multiplayer gameplay this is footage of
the<00:00:17.369> hunter<00:00:17.820> game<00:00:18.060> mode<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> you're<00:00:19.199> probably

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the hunter game mode and you're probably

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
the hunter game mode and you're probably
wondering<00:00:19.710> why<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:20.010> featuring<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
wondering why I'm featuring this and the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
wondering why I'm featuring this and the
reason<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.640> infection

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
reason is that is this is a infection

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580 
reason is that is this is a infection
style<00:00:23.939> mode<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.480> thought<00:00:24.689> it'd<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.840> fun<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
style mode and I thought it'd be fun to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
style mode and I thought it'd be fun to
feature<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.189> type<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> modes<00:00:26.820> across

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
feature these type of modes across

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.519 
feature these type of modes across
different<00:00:27.570> games<00:00:27.720> every<00:00:28.019> once<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> while

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
different games every once in a while

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
different games every once in a while
when<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.830> stumble<00:00:29.310> upon<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.510> you're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
when I stumble upon them and if you're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240 
when I stumble upon them and if you're
probably<00:00:30.929> wondering<00:00:31.380> why<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> consider<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
probably wondering why I consider this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
probably wondering why I consider this
an<00:00:32.399> infection<00:00:32.880> style<00:00:33.149> mode<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
an infection style mode I'm going to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
an infection style mode I'm going to
kind<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> explain<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:35.969> with

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
kind of explain that you start off with

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.670 
kind of explain that you start off with
two<00:00:36.270> teams<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.840> team<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> smaller<00:00:37.410> than<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
two teams one team is smaller than the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
two teams one team is smaller than the
other<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.190> there's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.850> symmetric<00:00:39.300> abilities

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
other and there's a symmetric abilities

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.450 
other and there's a symmetric abilities
so<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.200> team<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.500> loaded<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.100> tons<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so one team is loaded out with tons of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
so one team is loaded out with tons of
weapons<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.940> ammo<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.600> gear<00:00:42.840> well

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
weapons and ammo and all this gear well

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
weapons and ammo and all this gear well
the<00:00:43.350> other<00:00:43.440> team<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.710> gets<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.219> simple

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the other team just gets these simple

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
the other team just gets these simple
bows<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> smaller<00:00:46.620> team<00:00:46.860> kills

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
bows and as the smaller team kills

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
bows and as the smaller team kills
members<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> larger<00:00:47.969> team<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.480> convert

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
members of the larger team they convert

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
members of the larger team they convert
sides<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.590> eventually<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.309> happens<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
sides and eventually what happens is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
sides and eventually what happens is
that<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> smaller<00:00:51.360> team<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:51.840> becomes<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that the smaller team actually becomes a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
that the smaller team actually becomes a
larger<00:00:52.620> team<00:00:52.649> flipping<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> tables<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
larger team flipping the tables so for

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
larger team flipping the tables so for
that<00:00:54.719> reason<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.170> consider<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> infection<00:00:56.520> style

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that reason I consider a infection style

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
that reason I consider a infection style
mode<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.539> again<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.140> big

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mode but again there's a pretty big

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
mode but again there's a pretty big
twist<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.340> infected<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
twist on this the infected or in this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
twist on this the infected or in this
case<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> hunters<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.010> ones<00:01:02.219> carrying

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
case the hunters are the ones carrying

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
case the hunters are the ones carrying
bows<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.300> invisible<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.110> super

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
bows and are invisible they have super

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
bows and are invisible they have super
strength<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.010> hop<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> go<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.270> over

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
strength that can hop up and go all over

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
strength that can hop up and go all over
the<00:01:06.540> place<00:01:06.780> they're<00:01:06.960> essentially<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.439> little

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the place they're essentially all little

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.390 
the place they're essentially all little
mini<00:01:08.369> predator<00:01:08.880> guys<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.189> up

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
mini predator guys and then the it's up

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
mini predator guys and then the it's up
to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> cell<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> paramilitary<00:01:12.900> guys<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to the cell the paramilitary guys the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
to the cell the paramilitary guys the
guys<00:01:13.439> who<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.710> loaded<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.250> standard

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
guys who are loaded out with standard

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.770 
guys who are loaded out with standard
bdu's<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> big<00:01:15.720> guns<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.860> play<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> bit

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
bdu's and big guns to play a bit

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.820 
bdu's and big guns to play a bit
essentially<00:01:18.780> he<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.740> how

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
essentially he I don't really know how

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.969 
essentially he I don't really know how
to<00:01:19.920> word<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.360> hide<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.570> seek

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
to word this a big game of hide and seek

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.289 
to word this a big game of hide and seek
and<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.340> essentially<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.000> boils

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and that's essentially what it boils

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
and that's essentially what it boils
down<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> hide<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> seek<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.470> guns

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
down to is a hide and seek with guns

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
down to is a hide and seek with guns
with<00:01:26.580> kind<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.150> infection<00:01:27.689> component<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
with kind of an infection component to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.770 
with kind of an infection component to
it<00:01:28.439> where<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.890> team<00:01:29.280> attrition<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it where there's a team attrition and I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.149 
it where there's a team attrition and I
really<00:01:31.290> enjoy<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> guys<00:01:31.950> are

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
seeing right now is some of the hunter

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
seeing right now is some of the hunter
gameplay<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.250> too<00:01:35.490> great<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> bomb

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
gameplay I'm not too great with the bomb

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
gameplay I'm not too great with the bomb
still<00:01:36.299> getting<00:01:36.509> used<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.049> didn't<00:01:37.590> even

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
still getting used to it I didn't even

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.929 
still getting used to it I didn't even
realize<00:01:37.890> till<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.340> match<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.820> had

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
realize till this match that had

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
the map you can survive if you're just

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.080 
the map you can survive if you're just
smart<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.690> try<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.079> avoid<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.680> enemies

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
smart and you try to avoid the enemies

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.789 
smart and you try to avoid the enemies
this<00:03:22.090> one's<00:03:22.299> not<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.840> much<00:03:23.019> about<00:03:23.170> killing<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
this one's not so much about killing the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.890 
this one's not so much about killing the
hunters<00:03:24.190> as<00:03:24.340> maybe<00:03:24.609> other<00:03:24.910> infection<00:03:25.630> style

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
hunters as maybe other infection style

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
hunters as maybe other infection style
modes<00:03:26.170> are<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:27.100> it's<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:27.670> about<00:03:27.760> just

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
modes are it's it's more about just

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.750 
modes are it's it's more about just
survival<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.630> hiding<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.170> avoiding<00:03:29.410> them<00:03:29.980> and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
survival on hiding and avoiding them and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.949 
survival on hiding and avoiding them and
this<00:03:30.880> mode<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:31.450> scary<00:03:31.690> gets<00:03:31.870> your

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
this mode is really scary gets your

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.960 
this mode is really scary gets your
adrenaline<00:03:32.019> running<00:03:32.380> really<00:03:32.769> fast<00:03:32.920> um<00:03:33.519> I

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
adrenaline running really fast um I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.940 
adrenaline running really fast um I
think<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.840> part<00:03:35.019> its<00:03:35.200> most<00:03:35.440> scary<00:03:35.709> about<00:03:35.859> it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
think the part its most scary about it

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.729 
think the part its most scary about it
is<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.220> all<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.600> humans<00:03:37.989> get<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> motion

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
is that all the humans get a motion

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.620 
is that all the humans get a motion
sensor<00:03:38.920> now<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.850> way<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> motion<00:03:40.359> sensor

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
sensor now the way the motion sensor

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.990 
sensor now the way the motion sensor
works<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.079> when<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.400> when<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.609> of<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.760> hunters

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
works is when a when one of the hunters

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.340 
works is when a when one of the hunters
is<00:03:43.269> near<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.630> he<00:03:43.810> doesn't<00:03:43.959> show<00:03:44.139> up<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.290> your
