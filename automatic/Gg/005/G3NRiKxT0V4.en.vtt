00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
parts about the shoe I wore the tongue

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
parts about the shoe I wore the tongue
like<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.830> jeans<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.430> right

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
like that and my jeans would go right

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.990 
like that and my jeans would go right
here<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.260> problem<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.710> had<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.220> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
here but the problem I had was this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
here but the problem I had was this
thing<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.080> wear<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.560> like

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
thing a lot of people wear it down like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
thing a lot of people wear it down like
this<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.460> looks<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:12.090> gross<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
this I think that looks just gross and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
this I think that looks just gross and
it<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.950> flapping<00:01:14.189> around<00:01:14.400> too

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it but it was just flapping around too

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.810 
it but it was just flapping around too
much<00:01:15.500> if<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> wasn't<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> place<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> only

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
much if it wasn't in place but the only

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
much if it wasn't in place but the only
way<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> keep<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.450> place<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.840> thought<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
way to keep it in place I thought was to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.890 
way to keep it in place I thought was to
tied<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.909> found<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
tied all the way up but I found a way to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.399 
tied all the way up but I found a way to
keep<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.299> secure<00:01:24.299> while<00:01:24.720> also<00:01:24.930> keeping<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
keep this secure while also keeping the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
keep this secure while also keeping the
tongue<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> here's<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.479> as

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
tongue out and here's how I did it so as
