00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
they're really have the advantage to me

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.160 
they're really have the advantage to me
overall<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.379> quickly<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.980> air<00:00:51.170> they're

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
overall they quickly get air they're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.490 
overall they quickly get air they're
their<00:00:52.860> best<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.399> me<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.820> around<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
their best to me all around I just like

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
their best to me all around I just like
playing<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.890> flight<00:00:56.129> types<00:00:56.460> no<00:00:57.030> grind<00:00:57.360> types

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
playing with flight types no grind types

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
playing with flight types no grind types
really<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> sucky<00:00:59.309> grind<00:00:59.850> type

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
really have it sucky grind type

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
really have it sucky grind type
characters<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.980> aren't<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
characters just aren't as good in the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
characters just aren't as good in the
power<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:04.199> type<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> power

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
power I think the my type is the power

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.940 
power I think the my type is the power
and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.570> flight<00:01:06.570> type<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.439> they

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and the flight type they have it they

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710 
and the flight type they have it they
have<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> complete<00:01:08.580> advantage<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.360> me<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
have the complete advantage to me for

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.800 
have the complete advantage to me for
some<00:01:09.840> reason<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.439> feel<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.520> those<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.540> can

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
some reason I feel as if those two can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
some reason I feel as if those two can
just<00:01:12.840> dominate<00:01:13.500> everything<00:01:14.130> power<00:01:14.970> because

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
just dominate everything power because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.499 
just dominate everything power because
it's<00:01:15.570> easy<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.439> um<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:18.000> crew<00:01:18.210> feel

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's easy to just um just a crew feel

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's easy to just um just a crew feel
and<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.560> need<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.890> flight<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> really

me going to do this you don't have to do

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.979 
me going to do this you don't have to do
that<00:02:52.340> cuz<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.820> got<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.090> fly<00:02:53.300> over<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.750> huge

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
that cuz you got to fly over that huge

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.800 
that cuz you got to fly over that huge
gap<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.610> you'll<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.090> glitch<00:02:56.360> yourself

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
gap and like you'll just glitch yourself

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.449 
gap and like you'll just glitch yourself
to<00:02:56.870> death<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.590> were<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.920> would<00:02:58.250> never

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
to death so if I were you I would never

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.910 
to death so if I were you I would never
just<00:02:58.790> risk<00:02:59.180> risk<00:02:59.600> everything<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.200> by<00:03:00.620> going

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
just risk risk everything just by going

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.949 
just risk risk everything just by going
and<00:03:01.340> flying<00:03:01.640> through<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.209> mean<00:03:02.630> unless<00:03:02.720> you

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and flying through it I mean unless you

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.320 
and flying through it I mean unless you
have<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.140> meteor<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.280> mean<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.120> never

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
have the meteor to do it I mean I never

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.270 
have the meteor to do it I mean I never
really<00:03:05.690> had<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.840> mirrors<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.380> fly<00:03:06.680> over<00:03:06.709> huge

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
really had the mirrors to fly over huge

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.630 
really had the mirrors to fly over huge
gaps<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.900> fact<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
gaps I really like the fact that the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.180 
gaps I really like the fact that the
scenery<00:03:10.640> goes<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.810> zero<00:03:12.170> gravity<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:13.040> then

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
scenery goes in zero gravity and then

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.650 
scenery goes in zero gravity and then
everything<00:03:13.459> just<00:03:13.580> shatters<00:03:14.180> when<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.510> go

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
everything just shatters when you go

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.660 
everything just shatters when you go
forward<00:03:15.260> that's<00:03:15.799> really<00:03:16.010> cool<00:03:16.220> i<00:03:16.280> really<00:03:16.310> wish

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
forward that's really cool i really wish

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.430 
forward that's really cool i really wish
the<00:03:16.910> background<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.690> know<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> little

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
things everyone the enemies are getting

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.229 
things everyone the enemies are getting
hit<00:03:19.820> by<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.170> um<00:03:21.500> hit<00:03:22.190> hit<00:03:22.640> me<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.120> know

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
like you know you're destroying the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.830 
like you know you're destroying the
gravity<00:03:24.769> i<00:03:24.799> really<00:03:25.100> wish<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.450> objects

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
gravity i really wish that the objects

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.150 
gravity i really wish that the objects
you<00:03:26.900> break<00:03:27.260> will<00:03:27.440> go<00:03:27.530> back<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.860> hit<00:03:27.980> the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
you break will go back and hit the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.759 
you break will go back and hit the
enemies<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.810> why<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.870> earlier<00:03:30.320> guys<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.530> was

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
enemies and why the earlier guys I was

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.930 
enemies and why the earlier guys I was
levitating<00:03:31.070> in<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.579> air<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.970> get<00:03:32.120> more<00:03:32.390> air

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
levitating in the air to get more air

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.430 
levitating in the air to get more air
know<00:03:34.940> if<00:03:35.060> i<00:03:35.209> type<00:03:35.510> character<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.260> that's

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
know if i type character to do that's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.420 
know if i type character to do that's
what<00:03:36.500> i<00:03:36.560> got<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.799> advantage<00:03:36.920> they<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.400> just

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
what i got the advantage they could just

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.890 
what i got the advantage they could just
regained<00:03:37.820> air<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.329> by<00:03:38.480> keeping<00:03:38.720> ourselves

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
regained air just by keeping ourselves

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.560 
regained air just by keeping ourselves
from<00:03:39.410> landing<00:03:40.100> which<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.880> don't<00:03:41.239> know<00:03:41.420> why<00:03:41.540> I

from landing which is I don't know why I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.520 
from landing which is I don't know why I
said<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.840> didn't<00:03:42.019> actually<00:03:42.110> think<00:03:42.320> about

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
about that but whatever take that high
