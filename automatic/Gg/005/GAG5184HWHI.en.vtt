00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 James committed suicide what james is dead 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.059
 yes, I understood my answer but who told you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.469
 said that where you heard it at the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.660
 television they just came from 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.410
 to speak you're sure it's James and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 not someone else 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:27.300
 they said that the victim was called 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 james walter to thema football that's what 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.129
 you did not want I wanted to do it 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 suffer 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.710
 no, but not to the point that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.710
 suicide 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.949
 I did not want them to do that but he 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.470
 made you suffer more than 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.470
 anyone maybe but 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.960
 I feel so guilty what is it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.399
 that you told him when you told him 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.970
 the whole truth just now I I'm 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.970
 am a little carried away 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.610
 I told him that he deserved to be black 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 that's what he did lola it's not 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.940
 your fault 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.230
 it's entirely his own perhaps 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.580
 that he preferred to end his life 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.110
 because he had too many things to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.910
 blame too many things they 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.660
 would not have to assume this type has 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.180
 preferred to run away and flee his life 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.180
 it's his choice and in no way your fault 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180
 thank you 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 I have one more thing to do 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.910
 before you forget all this story 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 want to go home how do you know 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.590
 saying that I think I know you 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.450
 pretty well now but how are you 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.790

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.790

 kept this letter and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.840
 could be very useful for our 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.450
 investigation we will do some research on 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.469

 that he will let us in they must 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.609

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.209
