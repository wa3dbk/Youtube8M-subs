of<00:03:08.430> us<00:03:08.639> so<00:03:08.819> I'm<00:03:08.879> going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.269> say<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.689> now

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
of us so I'm going to say right now

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.750 
of us so I'm going to say right now
either<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.879> think<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:13.349> our<00:03:13.560> next<00:03:14.189> two<00:03:14.430> dlc

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
either way I think that our next two dlc

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.050 
either way I think that our next two dlc
characters<00:03:15.389> are<00:03:15.659> going<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.980> static<00:03:17.760> shock

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
characters are going to be static shock

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.020 
characters are going to be static shock
and<00:03:18.299> red<00:03:18.480> hood<00:03:18.689> now<00:03:18.870> you're<00:03:19.109> going<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> go<00:03:19.500> hey

and red hood now you're going to go hey

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
and red hood now you're going to go hey
what<00:03:21.030> about<00:03:21.060> Zatanna<00:03:21.870> moving<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.349> hero

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
what about Zatanna moving to the hero

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.759 
what about Zatanna moving to the hero
side<00:03:22.919> well<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.620> at<00:03:25.739> this

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
side well I actually think that at this

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.729 
side well I actually think that at this
point<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.189> might<00:03:26.549> not<00:03:26.730> happen<00:03:27.030> because

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
point that might not happen because

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.520 
point that might not happen because
during<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.750> history<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.989> tana<00:03:31.229> video

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
during the history of the tana video

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.280 
during the history of the tana video
they<00:03:32.370> kind<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.699> portrayed<00:03:33.239> her<00:03:33.510> as<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.810> villain

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
they kind of portrayed her as a villain

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.110 
they kind of portrayed her as a villain
because<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.250> whole<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.639> it<00:03:35.909> was<00:03:36.000> like

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
because of the whole I think it was like

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.909 
because of the whole I think it was like
there<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.019> storyline<00:03:37.379> about<00:03:37.650> her

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
there was like a storyline about her

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.189 
there was like a storyline about her
mind<00:03:38.699> controlling<00:03:39.180> Batman<00:03:39.659> and<00:03:39.930> somebody

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
mind controlling Batman and somebody

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.119 
mind controlling Batman and somebody
else<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.650> even<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.609> clash<00:03:41.879> quotes<00:03:42.239> they

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
else and even in the clash quotes they

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.979 
else and even in the clash quotes they
she<00:03:44.129> is<00:03:44.669> at<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:45.060> Nevada<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.569> she's<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
she is at a Nevada and she's like you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.420 
she is at a Nevada and she's like you
think<00:03:46.199> he'll<00:03:46.290> ever<00:03:46.379> forgive<00:03:46.680> me<00:03:46.979> or<00:03:47.099> something

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
think he'll ever forgive me or something

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.490 
think he'll ever forgive me or something
in<00:03:47.549> Batman's<00:03:47.879> like<00:03:48.060> don't<00:03:48.810> count<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.199> it<00:03:49.260> i

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
in Batman's like don't count on it i

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.009 
in Batman's like don't count on it i
don't<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.799> but<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.639> most<00:03:50.760> part<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
don't know but for the most part to the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.009 
don't know but for the most part to the
justice<00:03:52.439> league<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.949> injustice<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.629> she

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
justice league in injustice I think she

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.860 
justice league in injustice I think she
is<00:03:55.049> portrayed<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:56.299> someone<00:03:57.299> they<00:03:57.389> don't<00:03:57.569> trust

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
is portrayed as someone they don't trust

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.899 
is portrayed as someone they don't trust
so<00:03:58.439> I<00:03:58.470> don't<00:03:58.829> think<00:03:59.099> she<00:03:59.310> will<00:03:59.430> move<00:03:59.639> from<00:03:59.759> the

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
so I don't think she will move from the

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.270 
so I don't think she will move from the
villain<00:04:00.150> side<00:04:00.299> leaving<00:04:01.049> one<00:04:01.769> spot<00:04:02.099> on<00:04:02.129> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
villain side leaving one spot on the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.670 
villain side leaving one spot on the
heroes<00:04:02.549> side<00:04:02.579> which<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.239> hopefully<00:04:04.139> go<00:04:04.620> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
heroes side which will hopefully go to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.979 
heroes side which will hopefully go to
static<00:04:05.069> shock<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.579> then<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.359> final<00:04:06.659> spot<00:04:06.959> on

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
static shock and then one final spot on

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.780 
static shock and then one final spot on
the<00:04:07.139> villain<00:04:07.379> side<00:04:07.530> which<00:04:08.220> will<00:04:08.430> once<00:04:08.669> again

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the villain side which will once again

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.539 
the villain side which will once again
hopefully<00:04:09.209> go<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.689> Red<00:04:09.989> Hood<00:04:10.310> tell<00:04:11.310> me<00:04:11.400> what

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
hopefully go to Red Hood tell me what

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.399 
hopefully go to Red Hood tell me what
