00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:05.690
 in this thoreau I'll show some functions but that silly for free 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.169
 To start, we'll come here. 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.979
 in option 2003 p 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.189
 shift and white we explain 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.740
 this option is where we can find 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.519
 from toll configuration 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.689
 to quintiles we have this kind of function of functions that we can 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.880
 to choose 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.119
 function outside medical ball with its alcoholic influence 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.090
 week we have a serious options 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 we also have that option 3d 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.240
 I'll leave a choice was the impressive lean function with the 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.530
 Function 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.880
 and I'm leaving this member 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.600
 here we can 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.790
 to go directly to the function of what he just did not fight 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.790
 and here we have the action to be of less 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.710
 I can say that at the time it was a baby phenomenon that to add 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.070
 and here it is independent variable 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.130
 have varied from the attendant then 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.120
 I'm going to go in here with her. 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.660
 xix 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 squared 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 or press enter 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 now that I can bring this function 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 for this bad option 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.200
 and then I can choose how much I want to propose for my 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.350
 Function 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.670
 and in this option of the Algarve I can have him calculate a year 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.800
 automatically then he'll punch me 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.090
 and make the chart cute the more you do not want 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 on the tv screen or low I know 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 dear watermill and here he will draw work 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 The advantage of bringing in this uim is that it will be the entire network leaps to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.710
 what else if you do not want 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.290
 It's just you finish typing 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.390
 and explain soon to draw 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.920
 and here we have a number of options 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.969
 in this option and without enem 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.319
 but we can find in the intercession 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.509
 area 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.309
 applies on flops 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.849
 I have 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.849
 the case the roots of this equation 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 as I said earlier single here 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:31.799
 if you do not want to adjust the graph you police that as soon as you finish 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.309
 enter this function 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.309
 click to next year to draw 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.439
 here is why we are in serious condition in my choice 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.430
 but if you do not do it it will do work also without any problem 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.719
 so for now and only thanks
