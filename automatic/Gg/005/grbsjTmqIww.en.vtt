install<00:00:48.059> everything<00:00:48.270> maximum<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> set<00:00:49.440> from

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
install everything maximum is set from

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
install everything maximum is set from
the<00:00:49.739> turbo<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.090> reason<00:00:51.449> why<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> didn't

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the turbo the reason why I didn't

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
the turbo the reason why I didn't
install<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> turbo<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> find<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
install the turbo is because I find that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
install the turbo is because I find that
it<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.600> made<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.750> car<00:00:55.020> spin<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> too<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it just made the car spin I too much it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.650 
it just made the car spin I too much it
was<00:00:56.430> too<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.910> spin<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
was too much will spin and it was just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.150 
was too much will spin and it was just
wiping<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> back<00:00:58.350> end<00:00:58.590> completely<00:00:58.920> out

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
wiping the back end completely out

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
wiping the back end completely out
