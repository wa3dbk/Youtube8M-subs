00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 beautiful welcome to the channel the day of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.089
 Today I bring you this look that is the look 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.900
 simplest that I have done in all the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.120
 History of the channel is super super 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 easy to recreate especially for those who 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 we do not have much experience with the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.670
 makeup and we want to see 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 arranged for any occasion 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 special this holiday season 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 please do not forget to subscribe to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 channel and accompany me in the networks 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 social'll start applying in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 prebase of shadows but instead 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 can occupy a clearer corrector of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.559
 your skin and seal it with translucent powder 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.090
 and it will serve us perfectly as 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.340
 prebase of shadows 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.680
 then I will take a blush the most 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.050
 they like it does not matter if it has glitter 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.660
 or does not have this in particular is a rose 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.059
 with brightness is not matte but can 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.860
 use an orange hue and what 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.870
 let's blur in the upper eyelid 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.309
 then I'm going to take this pencil 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.449
 my psuv brand eyeliner which is 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.540
 against water and I had them 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.220
 recommended I finally found it and what 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.140
 we will use to delineate the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.970
 upper lashes creating a very wing 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.600
 simple as you can see there is not much 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.190
 difficulty and with a brush or even 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.369
 with their little fingers they can start 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.649
 blur this color towards the edges 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.300
 creating a very disguised wing after 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.149
 I'm going to take a shade of brown 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.430
 mate and I will delineate the lashes 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.710
 inferior nothing very dramatic 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 I just want to define the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.790
 lower part of the eye after I'm 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
 taking these glitters but can take 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.369
 any brand shine 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.780
 including a shadow that has shines 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.880
 intense and we 're going to put it below 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.970
 of tear this will open us much more 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.680
 the dimension of the eye and well apart from 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.440
 that will add a look 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.780
 very attractive this is the finished look 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.330
 without tabs as you can see you see up 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.400
 that well presentable for which we are 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 it only makes curling the eyelashes 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.780
 whenever we several layers and ready 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.880
 for which we are encouraged by some 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.400
 false eyelashes I'm using some 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.850
 Very economical that are the 747 cream 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.070
 with the hard glue and as always the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.770
 applied by pasting only in the part 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.050
 central and then the edges I'm 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.360
 also applying mascara on 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.640
 the bottom to balance the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.530
 weight with the upper lashes and this 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 it's the end as you can see it's something 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.010
 super super simple that anyone 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.080
 can recreate in our house with what 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.140
 let's just have the blush 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.000
 eyeliner and glitter with the same 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.430
 blush that we occupy up we will do 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 the match with our cheeks and what 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.610
 let's apply in taps on 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.680
 our bone line after them 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.239
 I want to present these cosmetics that I 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.500
 just arrived that they are from the brand or 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.710
 Yes Yes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.110
 make up that are objects with positives 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.570
 matrix that are a brand of cosmetics 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.010
 of very high quality they sent me all 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:01.590
 these lipsticks are very high lip 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.570
 coverage that are long-lasting are 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.480
 vegan and not tested not on 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.090
 animals etcetera and here I am 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.590
 showing this the one that is neutral is a 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.040
 neutral pink and how can you see the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.140
 coverage is very high and it is very easy to 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.720
 handle brings your brush also to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.000
 manipulate the product is saved 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.770
 very much to have it in this little pot 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.200
 of this bottle with a droplet you 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.239
 can see everything that he achieved for all 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.730
 your mouth and well you can see some lips 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.290
 very neutral very presentable that is the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.290
 most people we 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.850
 like to see us in that neutral way and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.820
 Well, you know, I like it better 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.690
 dramatic and I used the hue in half 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.940
 which is a very intense coffee and that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.250
 It is also very easy to manipulate 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.000
 It's a tonality that I like a lot 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.910
 is 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.890
 more dramatic but nevertheless it looks very 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.050
 presentable also wanted them 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.770
 present as one of the options for 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.240
 this look and really the choice of 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.130
 color then you up to inclusive 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.740
 they can put an orange color or 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.959
 simply shine and then I went to 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.620
 final with this pencil eyeliner that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:19.519
 call not safe for work that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.970
 it's a neutral tone but it's a combat 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.940
 that can delineate the lips is super 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.250
 creamy the eyeliner is long 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.180
 duration and as you can see in the sun it 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.850
 see reddish with a medium tone 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.130
 rose I just loved it with the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.260
 pencil eyeliner and well this is the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.360
 final result of the look I hope you 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.030
 have liked for all that we are going 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.979
 starting in this makeup or that 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.800

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.110
