it a lot this is just a piece of plastic
tubing<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:26.330> has<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> hole<00:01:26.930> drilled<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.440> on

the side with an air line going down
into<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.000> then<00:01:32.000> just<00:01:32.360> stuck<00:01:32.990> down<00:01:33.200> in

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
into it and then just stuck down in

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.920

there to about here and then this small

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.880 
there to about here and then this small
area<00:01:36.110> down<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.649> just<00:01:38.530> filter<00:01:39.530> padding

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
area down here is just filter padding

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.580 
area down here is just filter padding
material<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.869> basically<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.410> is<00:01:42.500> all

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
material and basically and this is all

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.639 
material and basically and this is all
held<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.280> know<00:01:43.399> with<00:01:43.550> this<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.500> just

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
held in you know with this this is just

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.529 
held in you know with this this is just
a<00:01:45.890> heater<00:01:47.830> holder<00:01:48.830> but<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:49.880> mean<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.149> could<00:01:50.300> use

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
a heater holder but I mean you could use

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.730 
a heater holder but I mean you could use
just<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.440> basic<00:01:52.070> airline<00:01:52.630> tubing<00:01:53.740> suction

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
just like a basic airline tubing suction

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.169 
just like a basic airline tubing suction
cup<00:01:54.920> would<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.160> worked<00:01:55.280> also<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:55.910> what

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
cup would have worked also is just what

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.219 
cup would have worked also is just what
I<00:01:56.210> had<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.860> basically<00:01:58.190> how<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.429> works<00:01:58.490> is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
I had and basically how it works is

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.249 
I had and basically how it works is
water<00:02:00.229> comes<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.159> down<00:02:01.369> there<00:02:01.990> at<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.050> bottom

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
water comes in down there at the bottom

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.160 
water comes in down there at the bottom
of<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:05.210> gets<00:02:05.360> sucked<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.780> through

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
of this and it gets sucked up through

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.020 
of this and it gets sucked up through
and<00:02:06.530> gets<00:02:06.710> caught<00:02:06.920> into<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> particles<00:02:07.940> get

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and gets caught into the particles get

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
and gets caught into the particles get
caught<00:02:08.300> in<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:09.110> wadding<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:09.739> there

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
caught in in that wadding right there

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.479 
caught in in that wadding right there
and<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:11.000> reason<00:02:11.239> why<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.450> does<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.959> because

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
and the reason why it does it is because

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.180 
and the reason why it does it is because
these<00:02:13.489> bubbles<00:02:13.880> right<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:14.269> going<00:02:14.630> up

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
these bubbles right here going up

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.979 
these bubbles right here going up
provide<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.269> like<00:02:17.269> kind<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.690> suction

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
provide a like kind of like a suction

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.620 
provide a like kind of like a suction
that<00:02:18.350> draws<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.310> water<00:02:19.489> up<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.480> it's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
that draws the water up with it so it's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
that draws the water up with it so it's
actually<00:02:20.840> pulling<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.440> water<00:02:21.709> up<00:02:21.950> through<00:02:21.980> it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
actually pulling the water up through it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.310 
actually pulling the water up through it
and<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.360> look<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:23.959> kind<00:02:24.200> of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
and if you look at it and we kind of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.080 
and if you look at it and we kind of
tell<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.709> getting<00:02:24.980> it's<00:02:25.700> only<00:02:25.820> been<00:02:25.970> in

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
tell it's getting it's only been in

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.630 
tell it's getting it's only been in
there<00:02:26.209> for<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.799> day<00:02:27.799> or<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.400> already

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
there for a day or so and it's already

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.430 
there for a day or so and it's already
getting<00:02:28.730> kind<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.510> dirty<00:02:29.750> at<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.930> bottom<00:02:30.260> so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
getting kind of dirty at the bottom so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.680 
getting kind of dirty at the bottom so
it<00:02:30.560> looks<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.950> working<00:02:31.190> pretty<00:02:31.310> good

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.699 
it looks like it's working pretty good
these<00:02:32.690> shrimp<00:02:32.840> don't<00:02:33.140> really<00:02:33.320> have<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> huge

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
these shrimp don't really have a huge

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.509 
these shrimp don't really have a huge
bio<00:02:34.459> load<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.570> it's<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.320> huge<00:02:36.980> deal<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.280> have

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
bio load so it's not a huge deal to have

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.569 
bio load so it's not a huge deal to have
a<00:02:37.549> ton<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.910> bio<00:02:38.209> filtration<00:02:39.310> cuz<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:40.400> sure

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
a ton of bio filtration cuz I'm sure

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.100 
a ton of bio filtration cuz I'm sure
people<00:02:40.940> are<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.120> oh<00:02:41.269> my<00:02:41.420> god<00:02:41.600> what<00:02:41.959> are<00:02:41.989> you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
putting different rocks in it I am kind

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.280 
putting different rocks in it I am kind
of<00:03:04.370> set<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.760> these<00:03:04.910> at<00:03:05.180> least<00:03:05.329> for<00:03:05.540> now<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.989> may

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
of set on these at least for now I may

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.810 
of set on these at least for now I may
change<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.709> up<00:03:06.859> at<00:03:07.130> some<00:03:07.340> point<00:03:07.579> but<00:03:07.700> I'm

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.750 
probably not going to import any rocks
or<00:03:10.280> use<00:03:10.459> any<00:03:10.900> any<00:03:11.900> uh
