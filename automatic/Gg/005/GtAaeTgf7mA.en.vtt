 from christoph franz let's give it 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.630
 pretty chichilla let's make a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 campaign attack of goblins and how 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 be well in the background as a spoiler of a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.529
 video of what I'm going to do here 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.550
 little bit I can not help it now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.009
 you are seeing that I have a village 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.259
 quite peculiar guys let's see what 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.090
 such unfold in crystal 3 and 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.890
 It depends on how you go as you upload a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 video about her or not guys inside 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 then we're going to also tell us that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.309
 we already have a few moments and myths we are going to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.190
 make the attack with two goals a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 little witch an archer three freckle the truth 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.449
 that are quite the electric has been 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 It breaks walls and also ten sleeves 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.899
 It's worth an attack similar to the one I did in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.069
 war recently and let's do chan 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 chan no more or less than the parcel 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.199
 toy shop of the pk and with the two heroes 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 that is to say we have the we have the hero of the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 barbarian king and we have the queen archer 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 let's go pick up the clan castle 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.789
 that I think we have enough let's 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 see how kids climb the first thing that goes up 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.990
 8 has been quite quite up 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.729
 really build the air defenses 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.260
 they do in a while I said that what 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.700
 would go up and I also want to improve you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.870
 good problem I have enough things or 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.660
 is these days sale interest me 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.230
 quite and very small apart this we go 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.780
 to 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.820
 we have the cauldron of boys that had 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 done then they are full perfect 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.570
 we have two days of rage we have a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 healing of one of jump then we go 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.370
 to go to the pk toyshop guys and 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.710
 toy store of the pk that is already the last of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.790
 all with the penultimate forgiveness and for 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 where are we going to attack guys are we going to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 attack on the bottom because 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.280
 appeared because I see it easier by 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 up we have the mortars more 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.730
 defended and it's harder on the thing 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 well here I think you can attack by the 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.550
 sides but well let's try to attack 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.280
 over here we are going to sanction one here 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.720
 we have to give another one here we are going to throw 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.030
 a queen over here let's throw the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.680
 freckles and we're going to throw this away from wall breaks 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.910
 there's a way around here and see what 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.800
 such are we given attack guys are we going to 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.570
 try to make this go quickie it does not 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.730
 roll up to be very entertaining 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 sorry and see you see see see we are going to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.310
 throw another pk around here I'll go to the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 two together to see what happens I never have 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.820
 tried this could go well could not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.290
 go wrong but well I'm going to throw here a 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.300
 spell of rage I will throw the walls 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.340
 around here because I know that you alchemist of 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.130
 early you can throw this over here I'm going to 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.320
 throw a queen over here there is the gift 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 sorry and green then we have here the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.060
 pk that is holding we have here 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.170
 the queen's skills still for 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.150
 throw we also have the bone-breaker 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.769
 to throw or at the moment should not 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.209
 have no problem the moment is not 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.220
 going completely wrong, I hope that 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 no giant bomb and make us mess 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 we are doing so that the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.220
 witch we can read it pretty good 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.049
 has forgotten the king's because it is that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 sooner or later I would have to throw it away 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.140
 see if we already have tea is the the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 it seems that the gift is about to 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.590
 pull and more than guys this can be 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.540
 one hundred percent let's get the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.250
 first 100% the first guys since 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.379
 this village had only tried it 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.780
 once and is the second be second goes 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.090
 the defeated one and I think we should not 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.790
 have no problem a priori guys 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 ok we have only one a tower 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.480
 wizards that we may regret in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 nothing good, how little is it worth 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.379
 already going all the trumpets as you are 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.389
 watching it seems that the queen archers 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.459
 a pretty sausage with this one murillo 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.750
 it seems that he wants to burst it yes or yes and 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.859
 Well, all of a sudden it's gone for all 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.569
 because we're going to get skill from the 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.970
 queen and let's go directly 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.859
 guys to burst to burst what is 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.150
 the warehouse this we have already here 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.129
 we have it guys around the corner 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.109

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.269

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.530

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.680
