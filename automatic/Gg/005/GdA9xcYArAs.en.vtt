00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello near the heart comes to one 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 another three dead of tems max 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 put this dinosaur 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.300
 he is not exactly halfway now 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.580
 take advantage of a certain 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.690
 movie is made oh come on 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 about dinosaurs can always talk like that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.939
 not clarified 65 million years back 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.699
 meteor bum has to go dead all or 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 not exactly what is honest 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 still no one with the theory 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.679
 meteors just one of the most common 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 Considerations go to google what 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 happened to the dinosaurs 1 the first 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.530
 search result gives a lot there 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.239
 somehow extend creative response 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.379
 the next choices search results 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.149
 deal with the question why 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.950
 the first search result just one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.020
 propaganda for a creationist side 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
 is oh the creation is the faith 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.410
 that the universe is life too 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 the need and we humans through the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 the intervention of God 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 Accordingly, the earth can still be so as 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.440
 the scientists are claiming 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.910
 and in that I can be his 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 Lubricate evolutionary theory in the hair 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 oh yes and the go and people 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.399
 would have already merged and yes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 I had the desire in their place from the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.450
 ark which with respect to their extinction in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 song makes no sense but okay but 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.049
 is still fun that's also 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 a good example of that google 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.150
 even as smart as the people is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.369
 we use 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 in any case , videos died 65 million 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 but they lived there already 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.979
 160 million years that yes times ne crass 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 period of time and actually died from 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.159
 60 million years before the last - the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 first types completely out and it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.610
 it could be new again 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.290
 a 5 million year lasting 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 crisis time have given in the - 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.500
 gradually extinct completely because 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.610
 the continents shifted and that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 child is also the plant world 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 changed the consolidation itself 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.240
 to adjust 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.860
 adapt to 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 ok so the nut a movie club one more 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.790
 but seriously an animal out now 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.900
 several animals in the test tube 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.050
 mix the wine with it completely new 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.710
 is he coming out that's nonsense 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.330
 in fact, there are already a few 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.159
 strange and somehow too 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 disturbing genetic burials 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.280
 cats that glow in the dark 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.229
 for example, now turns the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.509
 ask why does power 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.009
 Well, stray cats are prone to 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 a related to the HIV virus 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.030
 pathogen 2011 researchers therefore 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.740
 cats with a go that they are against 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.479
 makes this disease resistant and then 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.459
 with a green fluorescent protein 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.660
 the propagation through resistance gene 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.310
 and the cats for the researchers easier 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.690
 makes comprehensible with the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.280
 side effect that the cat is now in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.720
 light dark way, are the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.310
 only animals we only research 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
 to be brought to shine round 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.150
 various fish sheep hare and pigs 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.640
 already lights are cracked and where 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.610
 the researchers had the genes out themselves 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.070
 the tora victoria ill type the flores 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.780
 shine but it works too 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.400
 a goat goat with donations 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.870
 example yes I know that sounds totally 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.340
 beknackt and no neither can the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.840
 cigarettes crawling still looks like 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.090
 swing spiderman from house to house 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.220
 but she also produces pretty much in addition 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.780
 the middle still spider silk spider silk 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.459
 if she neatly interweaves it 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.920
 the standards resilient and tear-resistant 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.120
 material problem is just on the edge too 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 you would have to come a heap 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690
 donate milk and who wants that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.459
 beautiful 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.079
 because he just asked the gene nazi 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.299
 achieve out seidl want to filter out 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.980
 however you do that, do not ask 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.060
 me what we do not follow in 2 of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.370
 first clarified 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.780
 apropos name dinosaur that is 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.700
 Greek and stands for thunderous 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.350
 excel that our frequent for the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.269
 descendants of the dinosaurs are then 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.769
 Long had known thesis, however, 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.510
 researcher that most of the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.060
 ground living dinosaur city 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.160
 conclusive outer skin as well as birds wanted 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.570
 I stay with it and must be the same 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.900
 terrible extra I correct myself 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.190
 but not my own 6 now 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.239
 So I'm a dinosaur 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.280
 not quite from Greek 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.720
 terrible exe and also not thunder 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.610
 Merkel often translated 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.010
 By the way, the word only dinosaurs became first 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.510
 in the year 1842 by a certain richard 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.790
 without debt and made up together 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.320
 the words of his un august latter 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.390
 means as much as exotic long reptile 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.060
 but researchers are unanimous 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.620
 are not the go but that means quite 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.319
 absolutely terrible in use as 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.420
 superlative 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.189
 about as much as tremendously big and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 it was almost big or terrifying 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.209
 big but not necessarily stuck and 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.950
 beyond that, we only make you angry 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.139
 just ten percent of the species of the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.180
 Mesozoic eras of the Middle Ages on it 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.430
 already knows trias jurassic chalk time 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.109
 terrorist lowy the sea serpent 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
 giant lizards political approach 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.409
 creatures of primeval times actually no - 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.000
 even if only part of the 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.259
 Creatures were at that time, too 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.759
 this was not the real thing 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.829
 but still they are and were exactly 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.259
 the terrible peter the everything and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.449
 have eaten or understood anyone before 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.550
 In general, the green welfare animals 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.889
 Such dinosaurs have been around for a long time 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.750
 the spring together so just before 450 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.039
 required 30 million years enough time 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.509
 for flash it is equipped with stock 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.190
 however, the early should be 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.479
 hardly disturbed the huge books 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.190
 The environment there was probably already 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.570
 dangerous enough though oxygen 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.919
 work and even then tastes of 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.780
 have been almost identical today 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.979
 many have to face each other - in the dense 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.720
 jungle or marshes ahead 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.430
 in fact , there were already many at the time 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.740
 different climates also difficult 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.520
 For example, not everyone offers dino 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.050
 was a giant 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.180
 in fact , their body size of 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.710
 deaf big that just gigantic and the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.150
 most of them could be left gradient 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.500
 air cavities in the bones so big 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.210
 but they will also have those 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.699
 mammals of dinos fed to 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.380
 positive drive in oman dollars from the 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.090
 size of a badger had baby - im 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.220
 market if he was a nest robber or 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.570
 You simply do not know thomas haas out of white 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.190
 exactly but certainly is that there is also a 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.560
 hated that gave to the mammals 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.090
 so that's it with this issue of 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.169
 nexans up a thumb and then 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.880
 but I would be happy 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.070
 you should still have her together 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.370
 or we will clarify the next week women 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.370
 becomes
