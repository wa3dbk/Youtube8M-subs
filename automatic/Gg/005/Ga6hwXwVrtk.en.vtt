and<00:03:59.130> job<00:03:59.400> that<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.959> flood<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.350> wiped

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and job that this is a flood that wiped

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.729 
and job that this is a flood that wiped
out<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.550> humanity<00:04:03.140> wiped<00:04:04.140> out<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.500> whole

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
out all of humanity wiped out the whole

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.280 
out all of humanity wiped out the whole
world<00:04:05.100> of<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.550> ungodly<00:04:05.700> all<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.019> places

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
world of the ungodly all the places

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.640 
world of the ungodly all the places
where<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.680> ungodly<00:04:08.100> dwelt<00:04:08.610> but<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:10.530> is

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
where the ungodly dwelt but I think is

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.530 
where the ungodly dwelt but I think is
quite<00:04:10.799> clear<00:04:11.190> there<00:04:11.640> probably<00:04:12.120> were<00:04:12.330> not

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
quite clear there probably were not

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.810 
quite clear there probably were not
ungodly<00:04:13.140> people<00:04:13.350> inhabiting<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.310> South<00:04:14.519> Pole

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
ungodly people inhabiting the South Pole

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.330 
ungodly people inhabiting the South Pole
so<00:04:15.690> no<00:04:15.930> need<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:16.410> God<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.769> flood<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.130> South

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
so no need for God to flood the South

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.610 
so no need for God to flood the South
Pole<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.239> central<00:04:18.630> islands<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.169> Greenland
