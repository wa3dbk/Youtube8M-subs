00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.410 
let's see your machine tell me about
your<00:01:07.910> machine<00:01:08.179> did<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.690> make<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:08.990> machine

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:33.080 

how<00:01:14.420> did<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.690> make<00:01:14.869> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:02:29.750 

okay<00:02:25.920> how<00:02:26.920> long<00:02:27.100> take<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.630> wheel

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
okay how long take you to do one wheel

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.300 
okay how long take you to do one wheel
depends<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.940> how<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:32.200> pen<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.800> will<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
depends on how the pen is will have the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630 
depends on how the pen is will have the
damage<00:02:33.700> depends<00:02:34.269> or<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> slight<00:02:35.709> offense<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:36.550> it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
damage depends or a slight offense so it

nice to have a knowledge of having this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.140 
nice to have a knowledge of having this
machine<00:04:23.860> because<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:24.889> through<00:04:25.430> unlock<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
machine because we through unlock it and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
machine because we through unlock it and
clockwise<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.680> when<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.949> make<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.400> and
