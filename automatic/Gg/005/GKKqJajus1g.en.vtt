basically what we have is block breakers

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.630 
basically what we have is block breakers
straight<00:00:30.599> along<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.380> line<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.160> our<00:00:32.340> long

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
straight along and one line for our long

in a minute you should see some more
coming<00:01:44.040> straight<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.460> yep<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:45.960> you

coming straight up here yep so as you
can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.680> efficient<00:01:47.250> em<00:01:47.689> doesn't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can see it's very efficient em doesn't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
can see it's very efficient em doesn't
really<00:01:48.840> use<00:01:49.049> much<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:50.939> how

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
really use much and if you can time how

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.260 
really use much and if you can time how
long<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:52.380> growing<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.090> then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
long they're growing for you can then

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
long they're growing for you can then
set<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.540> timer<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> say<00:01:55.290> okay<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:56.369> how

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
set your timer and say okay I know how

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
set your timer and say okay I know how
long<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
long it's going to take for these to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.440 
long it's going to take for these to
grow<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.649> let's<00:02:01.649> say

grow I'm going to want you on let's say

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
grow I'm going to want you on let's say
every<00:02:04.369> 180<00:02:05.750> seconds<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:07.530> should<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.829> equal

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
every 180 seconds we're should be equal

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.229 
every 180 seconds we're should be equal
to<00:02:08.129> 2<00:02:08.160> minutes<00:02:08.550> every<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:08.819> minutes<00:02:09.119> it's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
going to put blocks across the back of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.890 
going to put blocks across the back of
here<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.240> put<00:03:02.420> block<00:03:02.600> breakers

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
here just so we can put block breakers

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900 
here just so we can put block breakers
their<00:03:03.100> block<00:03:04.100> breakers<00:03:04.430> go<00:03:04.550> straight<00:03:04.820> across

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
their block breakers go straight across

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.850 
their block breakers go straight across
straight<00:03:05.870> across<00:03:06.080> sorry<00:03:06.410> not<00:03:06.680> straight

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
straight across sorry not straight

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.830 
straight across sorry not straight
across<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.540> then<00:03:08.540> we're<00:03:09.050> going<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.260> do<00:03:10.840> it

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
across and then we're going to do it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.510 
across and then we're going to do it
looks<00:03:12.110> like<00:03:12.260> one<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> systems<00:03:13.010> use<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
looks like one of the systems use it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.600 
looks like one of the systems use it
over<00:03:13.700> filling<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.290> then<00:03:15.290> from<00:03:16.040> here<00:03:16.070> we're

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
over filling and then from here we're

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.040 
over filling and then from here we're
going<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.060> our<00:03:17.330> block<00:03:17.720> breakers

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
going to have our block breakers

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.110 
going to have our block breakers
straight<00:03:18.320> across<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.830> yep<00:03:19.700> like<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:22.120> then

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
straight across here yep like so then

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.580 
straight across here yep like so then
we're<00:03:23.450> going<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.630> uncover<00:03:24.050> this<00:03:25.570> then<00:03:26.570> if<00:03:27.320> I

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
wanted to make this better you could use

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.920 
wanted to make this better you could use
normal<00:05:41.039> pipes<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:42.360> know<00:05:42.389> cobblestone

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
normal pipes you know cobblestone

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.420 
normal pipes you know cobblestone
transport<00:05:43.379> pipes<00:05:43.589> and<00:05:43.919> then<00:05:44.069> you<00:05:44.190> could<00:05:44.339> have

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430
