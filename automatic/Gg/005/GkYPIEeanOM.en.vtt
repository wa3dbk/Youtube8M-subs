and to be honest you just don't notice
is<00:01:15.909> there<00:01:16.120> but<00:01:16.750> when<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:16.990> look<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.260> mirror

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.539 
you can see is it sticking out which is
very<00:01:19.450> useful<00:01:19.659> because<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.350> can<00:01:20.619> tell<00:01:20.890> that

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549
