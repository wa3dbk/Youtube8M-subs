00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.129
 I feel that the gold from 90 to 95 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.680
 percent of the fall since 1922 to the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.029
 ounce that he played in the year 2011 is very 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.130
 close to placing a floor very 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.900
 meaningful let's give a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.809
 conference where we are going to demonstrate 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.849
 as technically combining some 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:30.790
 fibonacci windows tools 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.619
 that I use would be giving me that year 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.250
 2014 is going to be the year of recovery 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.469
 of gold the floor or base of gold 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.320
 I estimate that it can be between 1150 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.760
 dollars an ounce in 1050 ounces and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.089
 I think gold is going to recover very 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.670
 strongly estimated that by 2015 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.309
 2016 the gold will be back in a thousand 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.570
 800 thousand 900 dollars an ounce and I think 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.249
 that will go above those levels 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.249
 above 2000 dollars an ounce 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.890
 because many forget that gold 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.200
 is an asset that shelters against the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 inflation gives me the feeling that all 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.909
 the efforts that are making the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.830
 federal reserve for will end 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.780
 generating inflation and that inflation is going to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.750
 generate that people again come back 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.369
 to gold as an alternative not for a fall 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.180
 of wall street but because it's going to go up 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.250
 this usa the american bag but let's go 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.440
 to start economic growth and 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.050
 let's start to see inflation in 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.369
 us and people are going to see gold in a 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.369
 coverage for that inflation 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.409
 I would expect to bet on gold in the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.450
 1200 dollar zone between 1150 and 1050 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.850
 of the ounce yet I do not believe that all 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.000
 he lacks a gold drop of 62 but the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.259
 90% the street we already saw it, so if 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.409
 you are a recommendation 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.979
 I could sell wood now let's say 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.840
 of 1100 in 150 say sell putter the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.000
 sense that they give me pay me a bonus 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.909
 and the gold I think that there you will find 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.470
 a very strong support between 1150 and 1050 and 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.210
 time runs in my favor 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.190
 then when I tap that level I would buy 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.220
 physical because there really is if I find 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.660
 a physical contract in future gold spot 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.209
 because I think I guess a great 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.100
 recovery as I tell you the ratios of 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.850
 and santi against gold are very depressed 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.260
 to levels from 0 70 to 0 80 I am 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.510
 buyers it seems to me there 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.239
 would change the next year of camps and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.150
 now the isap was going to keep going up but 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.810
 gold will rise more and peru a lot 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 more because it was the big bag punished 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.799
 and fixed boat in Latin America is the worst 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.299
 bag that has been in this year because 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.299
 they have the theme of gold
