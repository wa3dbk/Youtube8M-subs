00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
basic four balls the first thing you got

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.130 
basic four balls the first thing you got
to<00:00:17.910> learn<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> want<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.720> four<00:00:18.960> ball

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to practice doing two balls in one hand

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.660 
to practice doing two balls in one hand
in<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.969> fountain<00:00:33.210> style<00:00:33.630> pattern<00:00:34.489> then<00:00:35.489> once

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
in a fountain style pattern then once

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250 
in a fountain style pattern then once
you<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.120> practice<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
you get that down practice with the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.130 
you get that down practice with the
other<00:00:37.410> hand<00:00:37.680> giving<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> opposite<00:00:39.000> way

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
other hand giving it the opposite way

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
other hand giving it the opposite way
fountain<00:00:40.140> style<00:00:40.379> pattern<00:00:41.030> once<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.239> both

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fountain style pattern once you get both

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
fountain style pattern once you get both
those<00:00:42.660> down<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
those down you just all you really do is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
those down you just all you really do is
you<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.140> together<00:00:46.430> now<00:00:47.430> watch<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.910> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you put them together now watch I have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
you put them together now watch I have
the<00:00:48.480> purple<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> blue<00:00:49.320> ball<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.399> my

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the purple and the blue ball in in my

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
the purple and the blue ball in in my
right<00:00:50.879> hand<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> green<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> red

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
right hand I have the green in the red

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
right hand I have the green in the red
in<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.250> left<00:00:53.430> hand<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.809> never

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
in my left hand now they will never

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
in my left hand now they will never
switch<00:00:55.379> throughout<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> pattern<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
switch throughout the pattern so you

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
switch throughout the pattern so you
just<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:59.690> one<00:01:00.690> hand<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> two

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
just put the two in one hand and the two

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
just put the two in one hand and the two
in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:02.010> hand<00:01:02.250> put<00:01:03.030> those<00:01:03.180> patterns

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
in the other hand put those patterns

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.050 
in the other hand put those patterns
together<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.670> four<00:01:05.880> ball

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
together and you got your four ball

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.770 
together and you got your four ball
juggling<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> balls<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> never<00:01:08.250> cross

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
juggling now the balls will never cross

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
juggling now the balls will never cross
from<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.810> hand<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> another<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.610> two

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
from one hand to another it's just two

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.910 
from one hand to another it's just two
in<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.090> hand<00:01:12.170> using<00:01:13.170> both<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.530> hands<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
in one hand using both your hands at the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.470 
in one hand using both your hands at the
same<00:01:13.950> time

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.580 

you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.499 

okay<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.189> once<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.520> get<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.729> four<00:01:27.939> ball<00:01:28.119> basic

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
okay so once you get the four ball basic

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.179 
okay so once you get the four ball basic
pattern<00:01:28.869> down<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.530> next<00:01:29.799> thing<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:29.950> you're

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
pattern down the next thing that you're

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.080 
pattern down the next thing that you're
going<00:01:30.219> to<00:01:30.399> want<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.609> do<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:30.850> you're<00:01:30.909> going<00:01:31.030> to

want to practice some tricks right in
these<00:01:33.189> tricks<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.909> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.240> be<00:01:34.360> throwing

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
these tricks we are going to be throwing

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.039 
these tricks we are going to be throwing
a<00:01:34.929> ball<00:01:35.920> from<00:01:36.310> one<00:01:36.460> hand<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.850> other<00:01:36.969> but<00:01:37.960> in

to well as in each hand you're going to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.039 
to well as in each hand you're going to
have<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.009> throw<00:01:42.250> from<00:01:43.179> this<00:01:43.420> hand<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.899> this

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
have to throw from this hand to this

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.230 
have to throw from this hand to this
hand<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.399> what<00:01:45.549> you're<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.819> do<00:01:45.969> is

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
hand so what you're going to do is

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.910 
hand so what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:46.569> going<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.810> you're<00:01:47.500> going<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.679> start

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
you're going to you're going to start

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.069 
you're going to you're going to start
out<00:01:48.039> your<00:01:48.219> pattern<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.149> you're<00:01:49.929> going<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
out your pattern and you're going to

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.850 
out your pattern and you're going to
throw<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.350> reverse<00:01:50.619> throw<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.959> hand<00:01:53.229> so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
throw a reverse throw to that hand so

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.919 
throw a reverse throw to that hand so
I'm<00:01:53.920> going<00:01:54.069> to<00:01:54.100> throw<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> reverse<00:01:54.429> throw<00:01:55.030> to

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
I'm going to throw a reverse throw to

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.889 
I'm going to throw a reverse throw to
this<00:01:56.079> end<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.429> at<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.640> same<00:01:57.819> time<00:01:57.880> I'm<00:01:58.810> going

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
this end and at the same time I'm going

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.539 
this end and at the same time I'm going
to<00:01:59.049> throw<00:01:59.229> one<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.560> these<00:01:59.649> balls<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.069> this<00:02:00.310> hand

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
to throw one of these balls to this hand

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.889 
to throw one of these balls to this hand
because<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.759> still<00:02:00.970> going<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.149> have<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.450> any<00:02:01.659> ten

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
because I still going to have to any ten

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.229 
because I still going to have to any ten
so<00:02:02.709> watch<00:02:02.860> closely<00:02:05.399> after<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.429> verse<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.149> a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
so watch closely after a verse and a

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.740 
so watch closely after a verse and a
bring<00:02:07.450> one<00:02:07.599> under

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:27.940 

you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.640 

after<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.050> you're<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.500> can

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
after that you're going to you can

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.100 
after that you're going to you can
actually<00:02:30.860> add<00:02:31.280> them<00:02:31.520> together<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.300> throw

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually add them together you can throw

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.890 
actually add them together you can throw
these<00:02:34.069> two<00:02:34.310> balls<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.940> hand<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.510> throw

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
these two balls to this hand and throw

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.390 
these two balls to this hand and throw
these<00:02:36.050> two<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.590> hence<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.069> switch

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
these two to this hence you can switch

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.949 
these two to this hence you can switch
them<00:02:37.580> by<00:02:38.269> doing<00:02:38.330> two<00:02:38.780> throws<00:02:39.489> okay<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.750> watch

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
them by doing two throws okay so watch

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.350 
them by doing two throws okay so watch
I'm<00:02:42.769> going<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.430> same<00:02:43.670> thing<00:02:43.940> but<00:02:44.180> I'm

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
I'm going to do the same thing but I'm

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.270 
I'm going to do the same thing but I'm
going<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.569> throw<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.290> now<00:02:45.920> i'm<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.160> to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
going to throw to and now i'm going to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.180 
going to throw to and now i'm going to
throw<00:02:46.310> two<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.819> these<00:02:47.110> underneath<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.950> switch

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
throw two of these underneath to switch

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:59.580 
throw two of these underneath to switch
them<00:02:49.400> from<00:02:49.849> one<00:02:50.000> hand<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.269> another

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.490 

hey<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.790> here's<00:03:02.030> one<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.540> pretty<00:03:03.050> much<00:03:03.170> taught

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
hey so here's one I pretty much taught

hey so here's one I pretty much taught
myself<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.160> don't<00:03:04.400> know<00:03:04.490> if<00:03:04.550> this<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.700> an

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
myself I don't know if this is an

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.870 
myself I don't know if this is an
official<00:03:05.210> trick<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.440> can't<00:03:06.620> ride<00:03:06.880> it's

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
official trick but you can't ride it's

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.960 
official trick but you can't ride it's
basically<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.330> starting<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.990> Mills<00:03:09.260> mess<00:03:09.970> but

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
basically the starting to Mills mess but

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.870 
basically the starting to Mills mess but
you<00:03:11.270> don't<00:03:11.450> go<00:03:12.260> completely<00:03:12.620> into<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.160> watch

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you don't go completely into it watch

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.610 
you don't go completely into it watch
i'm<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.300> going<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.540> cross<00:03:14.870> my<00:03:15.080> arms<00:03:15.110> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
i'm just going to cross my arms and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.430 
i'm just going to cross my arms and
switch<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.920> /<00:03:16.580> from<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.840> side<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.320> other

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
switch to / from one side to the other

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.290 
switch to / from one side to the other
at<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.860> same<00:03:19.070> time

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.960 

you

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.020 

okay<00:03:37.960> another<00:03:38.230> basic<00:03:38.680> trick<00:03:38.920> not<00:03:39.700> really<00:03:40.000> a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
okay another basic trick not really a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.820 
okay another basic trick not really a
trick<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.930> basically<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.410> juggling

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
trick it's basically just juggling

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.410 
trick it's basically just juggling
you're<00:03:42.490> going<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.850> synchronized

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
you're going to do a synchronized

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.780 
you're going to do a synchronized
fountain<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.800> instead<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.160> doing<00:03:45.400> your<00:03:45.430> basic

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
fountain so instead of doing your basic

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.390 
fountain so instead of doing your basic
pattern<00:03:46.150> one<00:03:46.360> after<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.780> other<00:03:47.400> instead

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
pattern one after the other instead

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.880 
pattern one after the other instead
you're<00:03:48.550> going<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> throw<00:03:48.820> up<00:03:49.120> at<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.540> time<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
you're going to throw up at one time and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.380 
you're going to throw up at one time and
throw<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.220> other<00:03:51.340> ones<00:03:51.610> in<00:03:51.730> between<00:03:51.790> it's<00:03:52.300> a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
throw the other ones in between it's a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.990 
throw the other ones in between it's a
simultaneous<00:03:53.040> fountain<00:03:55.680> okay<00:03:56.730> there's<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.820> lot

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
simultaneous fountain okay there's a lot

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.210 
simultaneous fountain okay there's a lot
of<00:03:58.030> tricks<00:03:58.390> but<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.260> last<00:03:59.440> thing<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.950> want<00:04:00.190> to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
of tricks but the last thing I want to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.680 
of tricks but the last thing I want to
show<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.490> is<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:03.100> my<00:04:03.250> favorite<00:04:03.670> way<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.090> get

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
show you is it's my favorite way to get

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.390 
show you is it's my favorite way to get
into<00:04:04.840> four<00:04:05.170> balls<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:06.210> do<00:04:07.210> it<00:04:07.540> using<00:04:08.140> all<00:04:08.530> four

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.550 
balls in one hand I toss all four over
to<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:12.490> hand<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.570> first<00:04:13.840> 2i<00:04:14.050> catch<00:04:14.350> I'm

to this hand and the first 2i catch I'm

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.699 
to this hand and the first 2i catch I'm
going<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.770> toss<00:04:14.950> back<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.640> end<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.709> I'm
