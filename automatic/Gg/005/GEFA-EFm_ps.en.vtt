00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:08.020
 so I will try to film how 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.570
 disassemble the facade this part for 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.030
 give you a car radio that is not 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.440
 not cassette 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.160
 although it is nice enough retro 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:25.180
 but hey it's a little more galÃ¨re what 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:27.660
 so we'll start by removing everything 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 without shine 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.390
 but here below screw outside 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.980
 high schools you see them left and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 right 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 his two sons noah must remove there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:55.769
 will also have behind this button a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 mistake this is a here here I want 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.710
 disassemble that and after day show there 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 above 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.479
 there I just removed this part so 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.690
 once we have the shutter the three lives 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.080
 what I showed you must be drawn 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.090
 firmly on the whole thing left 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.729
 but right a poor have pulled well 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.799
 without damaging anything and there in 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.630
 below you see who's the notch 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.649
 that's where they go in this hole is 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.670
 so one on both sides for 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.020
 the moment I think we do not need 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.060
 to disassemble more than that rally is this 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.490
 thing and I think that's all I 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.750
 continues by the party baas is ok I 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.810
 dismantled and life they had under 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.210
 the behind the ashtray alas after you 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 have you found yourself with a screw of 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.729
 each side is here that supports the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 car radio support each 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.000
 side 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.439
 once you have disassemble these two 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:13.000
 vices you shoot the whole thing 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:18.540
 then it comes alone 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.739
 the car radio k7 the connectivity and then 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.030
 the insured side you have screw that 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.380
 support car radio on each side and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.209
 2 who support the what-what and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.959
 instead of the one you go 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.180
 able to put another another another post 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.900
 or else you replace this one but 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.560
 after that will have to buy the facade 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.470
 not all and all its buttons in front of what 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.340
 here I think it's you for the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.830
 reassembly does that inversely and then 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.280
 here we go with it's all 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.280
 that you want 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.840
 to remove this empty pockets from one the most 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.150
 simple is to dismantle the entire facade 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:10.540
 to remove all the movies we take away 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:14.620
 everything but after you are going to have some 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.079
 little guts there and that stuff they go they 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.569
 hold the empty pockets in place so 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.519
 in fact you spread a little bit is his 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.750
 two metal legs or spread it and 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.569
 and then you can go out 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.069
 trick tonight is broken and after your 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.560
 car radio or insert it in a way that 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.299
 be careful to put it in the right 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.940
 meaning be very serious 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.370
 and then you can still keep 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.879
 this phase is what but if not he 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.569
 is a facade without the buttons of 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.569
 the car radio k7 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.030
 and that's when you'll have everything 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:56.049
 reinstall you will have your new 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:58.900
 post like that it's clean that's it 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.430
 it's not at all tinkerer what not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.290
 it's perfect and just that which is in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.579
 too much but good if you want 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.659
 save buying the right piece 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.760
 it's always a good solution 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.319
 waiting here thank you for watching 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.319
 good then we climbed
