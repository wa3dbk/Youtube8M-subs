00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.830
 std welcome to yet another video 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 today we do freeze vision 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.139
 course I'm curious okay note if you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.160
 feel and tone that kind of 'slash throat well 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.960
 it should be fine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 from where the pressure plate first lesson 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.750
 ok we'll go in this is not ice 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 shit i fall maybe it was he is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 hello that is not the intention 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.720
 I died once and I have to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 flying up again 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.300
 a pity slash ingame out here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
 so because we are going to do is therefore a course 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 folder with god where 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.420
 ice blocks yes this will be a warm one 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.430
 day i think i'm more into the game too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 keep our mission at free pi r i take 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 at the then check is chaos philips 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.719
 i 've been shit around this is glass it 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.219
 he seemed I do n't have to worry about anything 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.640
 but now we count briefs not otherwise 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.910
 nice 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.710
 well it is difficult ok i am never like that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 so so skeptical about a directory to it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 start the folder now because I can't 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 slip more and I ca n't do well either 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.450
 rinsing who he was done with for years 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.549
 dress on my 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.320
 yes this is my expertise let me down 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.700
 I want to say that I was very good at this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 was a lie but well the reason i 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 so a game ever shit people 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.040
 God just for the sake of clarity and is 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
 not so that I can get less slips 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 no is just because of that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 I jumped in the wrong place and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.229
 leather jumps and harder on ice 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 guys you would n't expect it though 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is true 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 ok now we can trust this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 probably not you in me 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.840
 look good to be one again 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.579
 don't you dare dropdown in this too 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 dangerous how i made it 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 whoever participates we are not so good at that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.130
 is the lie you know that yourself 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.119
 you are incredibly lucky 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.009
 had until now 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.899
 run to a spray i hope the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.390
 anjum checkpoints we are good at it 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.040
 nice easy peasy know a little chill 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 your laid back does not return much 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.009
 effort and no ass sister and such and such 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.479
 apparently we are very sorry 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.040
 well and yes I didn't know it myself either 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.799
 I thought yes we are going to nice region again 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 it's like some time but no no I 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.649
 want a checkpoint 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.149
 ok now it gets tricky then I mean we 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.899
 Really just don't have to slip themselves 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.360
 count 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.830
 we want to play very honestly alone 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.960
 he knows how i am too lazy to do that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.790
 I get counting on the six lips 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.170
 by now from this is really in 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.020
 more exciting than you think 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.310
 last we have a corn and now 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.410
 well that wasn't that hard while 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.700
 terms how do I want to make it count 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.390
 not because I first wanted to go back to 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
 the middle 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.920
 guys that sweat for oh i already know 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.030
 know how we are going to do this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.890
 yes they had him there for a while 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.240
 I know how to address this need watching 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.980
 See you just said I knew how 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.090
 had to do this after people succeeded 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.620
 just for clarity it has 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.910
 nothing to do with skills I would 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 probably going to say yes 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.459
 later I don't believe it was pure 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.230
 luck 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.430
 ok bonnie help see you worked afterwards 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.260
 then jumps mine 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.430
 it's so hard to see those blocks 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.810
 And then you probably think so 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.130
 you should not wear glasses such a thing is just glass 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.170
 it is difficult because it is all there too 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.820
 white and blue below ok you do n't see it 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.370
 coordinate when you grow 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.360
 of the block offspring but it worked 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.220
 not 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.330
 we know that it's just another 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.370
 try once I like it 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.800
 trail map so despite the fact that 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.230
 he does not make what we are not working perfectly 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.239
 not looking forward to tree side 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.680
 Just start I jumped I was to 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.700
 percent sure it should just be 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.690
 keep trying 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.360

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.110

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.700

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.900
 not nice and not nice either 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.190
 oh but no your story too junk again 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.780

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.750
 Also you how many times we had this morning 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.110
 thank you how expensive life is 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.090
 ok this is bother no pure public can do this 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.959

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.150
 flashback please oh well yes it is now 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.750
 it became clear according to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.060
 me 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.170

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.610
 back to the beginning 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.780
 we have to stop the jump here 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.860
 it is just that clear 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.330
 gotta think i have 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.030

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.070
 more are coming soon as I understand 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.000

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.970

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.789
 just stand where we were and me again 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.000

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.860
 exit no it is part of there 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.020

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.690
 it does not work 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.300
 the rest is just as difficult the lesson is just 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.270
 so difficult 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.500
 oh and I managed to know what to do 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.810
 just don't do it either 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.370
 especially jump next to a block that helps 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.500
 look together so hard it's not shit 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.419
 there is more but this is doable 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.400
 this is really an apple egg I see 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.190

 watching much is enough with that I have 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.220
 think i'll go over it at once 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.940
 but no no oh space bar oh 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.690
