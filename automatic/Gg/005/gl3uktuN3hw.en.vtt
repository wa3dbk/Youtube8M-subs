00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.519
 climbing on meter high walls secured 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 with a rope over long route this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.300
 Everyone knows sport 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.150
 the discipline without be with short routes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.190
 but is still relatively unknown that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 So-called bouldering is a special one 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.330
 Type of sports director short routes with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 few handles are in here 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 foreground 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.490
 the difference to conventional tapping 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
 is that one climbed the departure and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 on a ground matte lands a lot 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.009
 more than climbing shoes are needed for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.100
 you do not have to be a citizen 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.480
 bring along fun in the movement 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.520
 surely you should know that way 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.550
 motion coordination only bring 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.789
 Power reserves are not wrong 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.860
 However, one can say by 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.530
 smart climbing on power right 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:01:02.550
 make up for it but first and foremost 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:04.320
 is fun and pleasurable because bouldering the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 requires mastering a variety 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 from peter techniques and school the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.000
 variety of movement at different 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.310
 when structures 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.690
 There is something for every age group 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 we have our youngest ones 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.100
 start climbing at the age of 34 and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 The oldest climbers we boulder boulder 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 There are certainly already 75 here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.870
 years when maybe not bouldering 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:36.510
 quite the old maybe just once in the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.460
 Months like to come sporty 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.920
 we want to press but we have just 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.140
 here in the region trier very very good 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.510
 Pictures also in the worldcup top 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.940
 with bouldering then it is of course one 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.620
 very intensive thing you have to do several times 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.020
 in the week actually technically for it 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.150
 occurs is recorded every sport 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.320
 you want to belong to the top 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 there you have to stream daily since 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 bouldering is one of the 70s years 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.600
 own discipline of sports director and 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.390
 has especially in the nineties years 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.130
 experienced a rapid development 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.720
 the cube trier opened the boulder wall 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.390
 middle of 2012 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.240
 we do not realize that not all boys 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.400
 people and trier little theme with which the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 can begin building land a reason 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.830
 piece-wide construction but of course 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.780
 is it just among the adolescents 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.400
 target groups already very hard we 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.500
 We are happy to offer it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.570
 and it is also going to be very good 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.160
 More and more this year has now become the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.560

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.760
 fought 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.820
 The competition was divided into two 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.590

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.690

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.390
 completely new citizens screwed down 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.680
 unscrewed and completely new 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.090

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.570
 but everyone has the same starting conditions 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 That's why we have it all on Fridays 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.530
 Riffe taken out and two nights long 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.830

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.470
 as bobic that have fought to 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.299

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 been done 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.420
 even from the younger group 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 as there is no assurance for the citizen 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.060
 There will be bounce mats used around 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.140
 to dampen the jump or fall 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.120
 In addition, the security partner can 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.130
 give assistance that has the ball 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.739
 Although not noticeable but ensures 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.630
 that he lands safely on the mat 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.630
 risk of injury is so very low 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.310
 overloading an overwork though 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.930
 very rarely actually that one on the

 Danger does not apply 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.500
 compare with football rugby and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.180
 football or things where that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.180
 injury risk is much higher 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.490
