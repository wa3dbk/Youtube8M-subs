00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.260
 I think that in this world we have the option 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.290
 to choose how to tell a story 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.360
 sad on the one hand we can sweeten the 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.919
 nothing is too bad to not 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.809
 can be arranged with a song 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.010
 Peter Gabriel This is the version that most 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.920
 I may like 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.190
 but it's just not the real one this is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 reality dating with reality doctors 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.560
 shows and the worst of all the group of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560
 support for 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.780
 next jason how do you feel 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.440
 you want to say apart from terminal cancer 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 very well I guess because we do not sing another 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.200
 song to be a teenager 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 If you have to be a teenager, do not 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.590
 Mandes a support group of a card 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.199
 fake so you can go to clubs and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.750
 to take certain they take it is not taken is that 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 I would only know if I had a false card 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.070
 makes a friend 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 waters diagnosed me with sarcoma 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.030
 will do a year and a half that you would like 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.540
 share your fears with the group the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 I forget as we say that is why I 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.830
 You look like that because you're beautiful 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.200
 seriously he just loaded all the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.460
 roll the roll and all this roll the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.780
 scams and we're not doing it either 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.360
 I also never turn it on 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.340
 it's a metaphor you put the gun 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.350
 killer between the teeth but you do not give 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 the power to notice a metaphor 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.610
 what is your story I was diagnosed 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.229
 about 13 years but the story of your 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.780
 cancer no or your history interests 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.150
 strange fetish hobbies 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.540
 I'm quite normal I do not agree 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.150
 for nothing 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 although there is talk of you at all times only 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.720
 we are friends try to keep 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.340
 distances with me will not change my 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.370
 feelings course and a grenade 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 one day I explode and now you know with 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.500
 everything around me and I do not want to make you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 hurt 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.650
 you can not choose if they are going to hurt you 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.620
 in this world but if you choose who you 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.300
 I'm in love with you 6 the caiss and 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.550
 I know that love is a cry in emptiness and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.890
 that oblivion is inevitable and that I am 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.030
 in love with you all the efforts for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 get away from you failed 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 I can not, we are a disaster 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.900
 you are pissed off very pissed off you need 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.900
 recovering 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.630
 I fell in love with him just like when 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.110
 you are asleep 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.090
 slowly and then quickly it's a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.090
 good life and leave
