the end of the day because I put I don't
show<00:06:42.370> my<00:06:42.400> new<00:06:42.789> parts<00:06:43.059> in<00:06:43.150> I<00:06:43.330> just<00:06:43.539> poke<00:06:43.689> weak

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
show my new parts in I just poke weak

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.049 
show my new parts in I just poke weak
lips<00:06:44.139> all<00:06:44.319> around<00:06:44.949> and<00:06:45.129> I<00:06:45.219> just<00:06:45.249> clip<00:06:45.669> it<00:06:45.699> into

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:46.059 
lips all around and I just clip it into

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.049 
lips all around and I just clip it into
my<00:06:46.180> hair<00:06:46.360> and<00:06:46.509> cover<00:06:46.749> my<00:06:46.990> hair<00:06:47.199> over<00:06:47.409> it<00:06:47.589> um<00:06:48.249> I

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:49.059 
my hair and cover my hair over it um I

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.360 
my hair and cover my hair over it um I
take<00:06:49.839> the<00:06:50.020> hair<00:06:50.139> off<00:06:50.169> every<00:06:50.529> night<00:06:50.710> so<00:06:51.039> I<00:06:51.069> guess

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
take the hair off every night so I guess

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.670 
take the hair off every night so I guess
that's<00:06:51.580> why<00:06:51.699> the<00:06:51.759> curls<00:06:52.180> like<00:06:52.419> you<00:06:53.020> know<00:06:53.169> hold

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
that's why the curls like you know hold

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.529 
that's why the curls like you know hold
but<00:06:54.339> other<00:06:54.520> than<00:06:54.729> that<00:06:54.789> like<00:06:54.939> during<00:06:55.389> the<00:06:55.419> day

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
but other than that like during the day

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.110 
but other than that like during the day

whole week I curled it on Monday and
it's<00:07:20.529> Friday<00:07:20.800> now<00:07:21.099> so<00:07:21.490> these<00:07:22.419> are<00:07:22.689> the<00:07:22.779> same

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
it's Friday now so these are the same

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.320 
it's Friday now so these are the same
crop<00:07:23.199> that<00:07:23.349> have<00:07:23.469> not<00:07:23.649> put<00:07:23.889> a<00:07:24.189> flat<00:07:24.759> iron<00:07:24.909> or

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
crop that have not put a flat iron or

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.209 
crop that have not put a flat iron or
curling<00:07:25.689> iron<00:07:25.990> into<00:07:26.229> this<00:07:26.379> hair<00:07:26.620> since<00:07:26.860> Monday

curling iron into this hair since Monday

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.070 
curling iron into this hair since Monday
so<00:07:27.279> the<00:07:27.879> fact<00:07:28.089> that<00:07:28.149> I<00:07:28.270> can<00:07:28.449> hold<00:07:28.599> a<00:07:28.689> curl<00:07:28.899> is

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080
