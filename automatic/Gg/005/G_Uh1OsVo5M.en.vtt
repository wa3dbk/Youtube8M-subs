right so it's so odd being all cute art
playing<00:02:48.100> like<00:02:49.230> you're<00:02:50.230> balancing<00:02:50.710> between

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
playing like you're balancing between

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:04.680 
playing like you're balancing between
the<00:02:51.790> bottom<00:02:52.240> points<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> cube<00:03:03.210> right<00:03:04.210> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
the bottom points of the cube right the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.720 
the bottom points of the cube right the
next<00:03:05.080> thing<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.440> you've<00:03:06.070> also<00:03:06.220> got<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.490> top

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
next thing is you've also got the top

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.000 
next thing is you've also got the top
points<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.270> cube<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:08.470> with<00:03:08.650> your<00:03:08.680> right

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

touches<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.800> point<00:03:12.130> right<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.330> can<00:03:13.480> go<00:03:13.660> up

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840

that's that's so what you may need for
up<00:03:40.180> stars<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.690> just<00:03:40.870> start<00:03:41.080> like<00:03:41.200> this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
up stars you can just start like this

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.970 
up stars you can just start like this
side<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.520> side<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.150> side<00:03:43.690> keep<00:03:43.990> laying<00:03:44.560> angle

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
side to side to side keep laying angle

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.000 
side to side to side keep laying angle
up<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.670> but<00:03:45.910> over<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.390> course<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.750> days

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
up like and but over the course of days

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.740 
up like and but over the course of days
you're<00:03:48.010> kind<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.220> letting<00:03:48.430> angle<00:03:48.760> up<00:03:48.970> more<00:03:49.360> and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
you're kind of letting angle up more and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.230 
you're kind of letting angle up more and
more<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.710> more<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:52.030> you're<00:03:52.150> really

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
more and more and so you're really

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.270 
more and more and so you're really
getting<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.570> delicacy<00:03:53.130> where<00:03:54.130> you're

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
getting this delicacy where you're

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.320 
getting this delicacy where you're
almost<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.640> head<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.850> won't<00:03:55.000> where<00:03:55.180> it's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
almost the head that won't where it's

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.550 
almost the head that won't where it's
almost<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.840> gonna<00:03:55.930> feel<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.260> you're

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
almost like it's gonna feel like you're

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.890 
almost like it's gonna feel like you're
going<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.740> balance<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.640> cord<00:03:58.000> alright

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
going to balance it on the cord alright

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.600 
going to balance it on the cord alright
I've<00:03:59.050> never<00:03:59.260> actually<00:03:59.440> pulled<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.070> off<00:04:00.160> but

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
I've never actually pulled that off but

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.720 
I've never actually pulled that off but
in<00:04:00.970> theory<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.840> molecules<00:04:02.260> will<00:04:02.440> align<00:04:02.730> you'll

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
in theory of molecules will align you'll

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.540 
in theory of molecules will align you'll
balance<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.510> tether<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:06.520> just

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
balance it on the tether right but just

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.630 
balance it on the tether right but just
give<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.970> time<00:04:07.240> it's<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.630> flowers<00:04:08.640> exactly

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
give that time it's like flowers exactly

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.310 
give that time it's like flowers exactly
I<00:04:09.700> had<00:04:09.820> those<00:04:09.970> drew<00:04:10.270> sake<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.720> could<00:04:10.900> almost<00:04:11.050> do

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
I had those drew sake I could almost do

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.960 
I had those drew sake I could almost do
it<00:04:11.880> like<00:04:12.880> slightly<00:04:13.270> starts

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.310 

my<00:04:16.970> favorite<00:04:17.269> thing<00:04:17.480> in<00:04:17.660> doing<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.989> lot<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.169> this

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
my favorite thing in doing a lot of this

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.069 
my favorite thing in doing a lot of this
is<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:19.160> I'm<00:04:19.280> performing<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.850> round<00:04:20.079> you

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
is if I'm performing in the round you

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.050 
is if I'm performing in the round you
know<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:21.440> I've<00:04:21.530> got<00:04:21.739> say<00:04:22.040> Rachel's<00:04:22.610> here<00:04:22.790> and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you know she's up take a step back

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.490 
you know she's up take a step back
so<00:04:26.360> say<00:04:26.480> I've<00:04:26.570> got<00:04:26.720> Rachel<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.230> say<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.470> a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
so say I've got Rachel and say for a

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.020 
so say I've got Rachel and say for a
moment<00:04:27.770> like<00:04:27.950> I'm<00:04:28.130> trying<00:04:28.340> I'm<00:04:28.520> facing<00:04:28.730> her

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
moment like I'm trying I'm facing her

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.750 
moment like I'm trying I'm facing her
she<00:04:29.720> sees<00:04:29.900> my<00:04:30.050> circles<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.800> for<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.639> little

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
she sees my circles and for a little

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.730 
she sees my circles and for a little
while<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.660> know<00:04:32.780> like<00:04:33.080> she's<00:04:33.350> seeing<00:04:33.590> some

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
while you know like she's seeing some

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.650 
while you know like she's seeing some
cool<00:04:33.950> patterns<00:04:34.100> but<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.880> realize<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.210> John

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
cool patterns but I realize that John

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.340 
cool patterns but I realize that John
and<00:04:36.130> Andrea<00:04:37.130> they're<00:04:38.120> just<00:04:38.389> seeing<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:39.200> stuff

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and Andrea they're just seeing the stuff

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.600
