okay<00:00:11.700> see<00:00:11.970> if<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.330> hook<00:00:12.510> up<00:00:12.720> here<00:00:12.930> and<00:00:13.080> do

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
okay see if we can hook up here and do

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
okay see if we can hook up here and do
some<00:00:13.410> climbing<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:14.520> using<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.060> seven

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
some climbing I'm using a seven

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.820 
some climbing I'm using a seven
millimeter<00:00:16.100> screw<00:00:17.100> link<00:00:17.370> it's<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.910> long

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
millimeter screw link it's a the long

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.359 
millimeter screw link it's a the long
variety<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:21.290> shorter<00:00:22.290> ones<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
variety because the shorter ones or the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.470 
variety because the shorter ones or the
regular<00:00:23.910> size<00:00:24.180> won't<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.260> around<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:26.120> so<00:00:27.120> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
regular size won't go around this so I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.690 
regular size won't go around this so I
have<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.870> use<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.290> long<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.860> does<00:00:29.070> nicely

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
have to use the long and it does nicely

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.520 
have to use the long and it does nicely
and<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:29.940> it's<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.450> that<00:00:30.660> much<00:00:30.840> longer<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
and it's it's not that much longer so

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.310 
and it's it's not that much longer so
that's<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.340> good<00:00:32.550> setup<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:35.870> PMI<00:00:36.870> strap

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's a good setup I have a PMI strap

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
that's a good setup I have a PMI strap
here<00:00:37.650> that<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:41.370> quite<00:00:41.610> comfortable<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.510> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
here that is quite comfortable and on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.189 
here that is quite comfortable and on

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
rope one makes one with their brand as

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.790 
rope one makes one with their brand as
well<00:00:46.230> I've<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.900> little<00:00:48.900> brass<00:00:49.170> hook<00:00:49.470> here

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
makes it very easy to hook in and I'm

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.060 
makes it very easy to hook in and I'm
gonna<00:00:52.739> tighten<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.280> down<00:00:53.339> good<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.240 

foot<00:00:59.070> loop<00:00:59.339> down<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.089> left<00:01:00.360> foot<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.250> I'm

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
foot loop down to my left foot and I'm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.410 
foot loop down to my left foot and I'm
hooking<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.620> safety<00:01:04.620> tether<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.519> that's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
hooking up a safety tether here that's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.670 
hooking up a safety tether here that's
about<00:01:06.810> 3,000<00:01:07.590> pounds<00:01:07.799> worth<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:09.299> on

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
about 3,000 pounds worth of now on

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
about 3,000 pounds worth of now on
holding<00:01:10.680> strength<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.370> maybe<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> won't<00:01:12.690> fall

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
holding strength so maybe I won't fall

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.859 
holding strength so maybe I won't fall
harder<00:01:13.440> than<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.789> last<00:01:14.789> piece<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.420> course<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
harder than that last piece of course to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
harder than that last piece of course to
turn<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> walker<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.149> foot<00:01:18.329> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
turn it into a walker is the foot of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.200 
turn it into a walker is the foot of
cinder<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.310> I've<00:01:20.310> started<00:01:20.729> using<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.649> CMI

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
cinder and I've started using this CMI

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.209 
cinder and I've started using this CMI
foot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> cinder<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.719> really<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> way<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
foot of cinder I really like the way it

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.529 
foot of cinder I really like the way it
works<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> need<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.520> release<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.789> cinder<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
works you need to release the cinder and

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.240 
works you need to release the cinder and
let<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> come<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:31.920> nub

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
let it come down there's a little nub

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.370 
let it come down there's a little nub
right<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.909> barely<00:01:33.420> pulling<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.140> comes

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right there just barely pulling it comes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.940 
right there just barely pulling it comes
right<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.680> I've<00:01:35.609> been<00:01:36.200> rather<00:01:37.200> impressed<00:01:37.770> by

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right down I've been rather impressed by

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.529 
right down I've been rather impressed by
that<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.549> course<00:01:38.609> I've<00:01:38.909> got<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.179> be<00:01:39.270> able<00:01:39.450> to

that of course I've got to be able to
make<00:01:39.719> this<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:40.609> cinder<00:01:43.520> advance<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:44.939> gonna

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
make this a cinder advance so I'm gonna

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.590 
make this a cinder advance so I'm gonna
do<00:01:45.359> that<00:01:45.570> by<00:01:46.070> like<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.219> did<00:01:47.429> in<00:01:47.579> another<00:01:47.969> video

just puts the rope and a good position

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:42.950 
just puts the rope and a good position
for<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.499> to<00:01:55.679> advance<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.429> here<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.359> go

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
