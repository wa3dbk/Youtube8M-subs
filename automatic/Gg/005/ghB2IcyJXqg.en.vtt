00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.160
 Well I'm Jonathan this time 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.020
 I want to introduce you this amplifier 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.630
 that says get off building your 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.640
 rock video hola.com 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.930
 I want to show the modifications and 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.930
 things because good 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.910
 the 400 watt that complementary that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.950
 it's there I do not put some barriers 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.930
 and for the departure of freight forwarders 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.640
 because I did not find a sink of that 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.440
 figure 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.290
 the change I wanted to buy condensers 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.520
 here in ecuador 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.020
 15,000 microns of 63 volts are a bit 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.010
 expensive from here I got 15 dollars 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.660
 each one are so immense immense that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 I did not get into the plate then I had 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.900
 that be a small adaptation then 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 I have to 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the part of here I have this with this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.310
 Transformers of 40 0 ​​40 and apart 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 other defendants and is here for the what 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.760
 what is the 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.350
 and the fans in this case my 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.600
 design is 2 front fans 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.540
 of course it absorbs the air that is 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.909
 around here the cold air goes through the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 heatsink transistors and exits by 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 here and the hot air 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.240
 what else can I tell you the heatsink 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.430
 same here you can get scrap metal 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.330
 a very comfortable price because it is a 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.910
 Huge heatsink of 22 centimeters 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.230
 thickness here in this part and more 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.240
 elaborated that has here 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.710
 then it is super economic 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:51.350
 the transistors here I have the 22 s 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.140
 everyone wishes 1943 I did not put them insulating 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.950
 then they go straight to the aluminum and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.490
 others the two s 650 and 200 are with a 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.900
 insulation I could not find the insulators 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.759
 of mica for this kind of classics 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.680
 dementia for the transistors of 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.810
 hat then I can not find 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.880
 for these then one capte was 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 put on masking why it is relatively 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.680
 paper then the paper forms that 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.230
 hot is not going to look for it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.230
 melt you can say so then 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.150
 is more than isolating me the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.019
 fan directly from the part of 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.019
 back of the transistor 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 So now I'm working with 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.510
 10-inch speakers and I'm going to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.349
 teach 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 10-inch diameter speakers are 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.189
 of 400 watts and then they are very good 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.319
 it has a good sound I have a couple of 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.299
 shines from the boxes that I designed myself 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.799
 it has a little cushion inside 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.550
 so that I try to reflect something more of 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.670
 frequency 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.940
 then that power I'm just 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.280
 using for medium frequencies and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.860
 high and just a few small frequencies 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.840
 low of the subwoofer which is designed 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.920
 every time it is and it is working like that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.600
 what it looks like is that for the subwoofer 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.270
 I have two larger transformers 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.550
 for the amplifier then he taught them 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.550
 to the network the functioning there 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.010
 yes no 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.560
 Y 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.370
 Y 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.770
 ah 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.300
 good that has been the functioning in 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.810
 the how can they see has a great 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:26.250
 new performance an amplifier with its 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.810
 Transient numbers here and has 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.880
 a great amplification performance that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.290
 that amplifier will be excellent 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.360
 I highly recommend you encourage me nothing 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.600
 I planted them I will be presenting the video 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.670
 where am I using this as a 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.560
 application already for amplified boxes not 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.160
 I'm making an amplified box 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.780
 with the mono monkey part of that 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.350
 amplifier not 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.510
 It should be emphasized that I had the opportunity to 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.419
 uncover an amplifier through a 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.220
 box amplified with jbl and I took the 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.320
 surprise that has the same amplifier 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.330
 remain with certain modifications in the 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.470
 tracks so but uses the same 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.669
 transistors is the same then 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.950
 based and that is the same amplifier 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.960
 I could tell that it's ideal for 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.460
 work in an amplified box 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.620
 then today it is coming soon 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.660
 I will be presenting this project to 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.380
 good as carbon paradores 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.380
 Thank you
