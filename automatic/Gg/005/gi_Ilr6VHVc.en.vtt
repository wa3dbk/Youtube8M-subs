00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
Academy and that's our advantage it's

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.470 
Academy and that's our advantage it's
the<00:00:21.990> potential<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.680> synergy<00:00:23.060> across<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.420> many

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the potential for synergy across so many

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.930 
the potential for synergy across so many
units<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> ability<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.610> them<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
units and the ability to get them to

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.120 
units and the ability to get them to
work<00:00:27.090> together<00:00:27.360> in<00:00:28.199> ways<00:00:28.350> that<00:00:28.860> no<00:00:29.100> other

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
work together in ways that no other

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.150 
work together in ways that no other
institution<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.270> really<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
institution can really do we have to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.309 
institution can really do we have to
forget<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.239> our<00:00:36.269> label<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.929> what<00:00:37.170> our

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:37.319 
forget what our label is what our

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.309 
forget what our label is what our
discipline<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.390> say<00:00:39.629> who<00:00:40.199> do

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:40.319 
discipline is and we have to say who do

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.340 
discipline is and we have to say who do
we<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.679> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> room<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:42.210> make<00:00:42.479> important

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
we need in the room to make important

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
we need in the room to make important
advances<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.609> important<00:00:45.089> problem<00:00:45.479> I<00:00:49.850> think

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
advances on an important problem I think

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
advances on an important problem I think
that<00:00:51.329> imposes<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> special<00:00:52.559> obligation<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.429> us

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that imposes a special obligation on us

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
that imposes a special obligation on us
to<00:00:54.120> reach<00:00:54.569> out<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.109> attract<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.889> most

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to reach out and attract the most

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
to reach out and attract the most
talented<00:00:56.699> students<00:00:57.359> regardless<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.199> their

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
talented students regardless of their

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.219 
talented students regardless of their
background<00:00:59.370> their<00:00:59.729> economic<00:01:00.389> status<00:01:00.510> their

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
background their economic status their

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.160 
background their economic status their
race<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.709> help<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.489> grow<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.449> help<00:01:03.659> drive<00:01:04.140> us

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
race and help them grow to help drive us

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.280 
race and help them grow to help drive us
into<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> future

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
into the future

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.070 
into the future
so<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:06.950> think<00:01:07.040> at<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> core<00:01:07.820> what<00:01:08.330> makes<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.870> public

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
so I think at a core what makes a public

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.590 
so I think at a core what makes a public
university<00:01:09.350> special<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.520> its<00:01:10.880> commitment<00:01:11.300> to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
university special is its commitment to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.720 
university special is its commitment to
the<00:01:11.870> public<00:01:12.110> good<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.800> what<00:01:13.190> I<00:01:13.220> mean<00:01:13.490> by<00:01:13.700> that

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
the public good and what I mean by that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.860 
the public good and what I mean by that
is<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:14.660> take<00:01:14.930> seriously<00:01:15.500> our<00:01:15.620> mission<00:01:16.310> to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
is we take seriously our mission to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.540 
is we take seriously our mission to
transform<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.290> public<00:01:18.440> through<00:01:18.860> education

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
transform the public through education

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.390 
transform the public through education
and<00:01:19.850> research<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:24.470> want<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.830> do<00:01:24.980> things<00:01:25.280> with

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
and research we want to do things with

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490 
and research we want to do things with
impact<00:01:25.910> we<00:01:26.120> want<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.360> do<00:01:26.480> things<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.230> make<00:01:27.470> a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
