00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.469
 good how about all I am going today 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 teach how a system of 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.900
 transport of minerals in minecraft 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.930
 floor for the latest version 1.5 because 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.660
 As you can see hoppers and good and others are used 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.119
 materials that are just that they are alone 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.439
 in this good version let's start we have to 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.480
 shed every material 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.340
 to the corresponding hopper for example 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 this one that leads before emeralds and so on 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 here now the gold here 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.580
 for each shape we go for each material 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.210
 there is a first time better 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.280
 clear and more comfortable and systems 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 if you want to transport materials from 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 the mine from the mine where you are 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 looking at your house and what can they 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.629
 they are founded there directly good now 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 I teach you, let's continue with this mine and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.160
 we come to our house for example that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.530
 is this let's say there is more 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.460
 simple then I will show how it is done and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.700
 also in the system for 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.010
 so you can download them and get to know each other 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.780
 completely if you have any questions 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.300
 here we have the three chests already in 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.670
 our house where he calls 'the as you see' 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.320
 another of gold and another of iron they call 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.050
 we love you and are coming quite 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.710
 gold diamond as you see and that 's it and now 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.720
 there is molten gold and iron and 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.899
 we have some cast iron and like 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.050
 I did them and it continues to scratch but it took 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.580
 a little bit because you already diamond me so that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.280
 It is cast iron and gold must be used 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.250
 ovens and that's why I put these two here 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.890
 trapdoors with which you can reach 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.890
 the oven that is up there beige and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.880
 well with him with this one and it's been putting him on 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.880
 coal in case it's over 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.120
 here it melts for example from 1 every time 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.000
 for this hopper and it falls into this that 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.710
 offers is here inside 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.510
 Now I'll show you how to do it 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.950
 pretty simple and good I'm going to put 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 in creative for well less terrain 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.650
 Let's go there 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.400
 for the construction of this system 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.220
 we will need some material as a base 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.870
 kiln furnace hoppers clear good that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.720
 you will need more I make more quantity of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.910
 these objects because I am creative and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.950
 good took less first than grace 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.780
 will be to put a chest where you want it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.230
 drop a thing that is founded for example 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.470
 yes well now you see 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 here and here it is very important to put the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.060
 peat in a blog that is on top of him 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.450
 so that the peat itself points towards the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.489
 chest if it does not point it may not work 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.190
 the next thing is to put another 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.200
 well and now do the same thing to 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.930
 wrong 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.480
 to be a little higher 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.159
 and here put another hopper like that so 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.650
 point down that in case you 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.019
 you need that the material is founded as 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.830
 iron gold then here you should of 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.990
 put an oven to melt 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.310
 also as you see it is very important that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.230
 point this down because if 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.850
 points reaches somewhere else not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.420
 will work fine now we will give you the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.420
 turn well 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.150
 now the system is done 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.250
 now we are putting rails 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.079
 now it's as if you've heard 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.590
 sounds of before you hear in the house and 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.799
 understand how this system goes from here 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.500
 we put tables good to go to any 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.930
 another object is simply to put 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 laugh at them 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.370
 in the past always and well not either 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 It costs a lot to do it and you have to 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.629
 fragile not require as much metal 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.230
 metal so for what I remember 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.239
 for each metal you have 16 was and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.450
 so it is not a system 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.540
 too expensive 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.960
 now here for example let's put a 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.470
 king propeller 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.000
 a side torch because it has 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.090
 unlocked our trolley work 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.090
 all right 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.549
 missing 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.090
 and finally you have to make a 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.709
 platform where we say I know where the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.920
 trolley that goes around here 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.210
 aggressive 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.590
 in the age of minerals here we can 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.770
 a peat 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.260
 and as last one, we just need to put here a 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.930
 wagon with your soul clear because if not 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.030
 is going to serve you 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.660
 well you 're ready for example look 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.310
 let's check it 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.310
 let's remove all this from here 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.420
 does not choose for example iron said gold and 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.720
 coal the coal as you saw before does 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.730
 gold is missing for the oven 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.620
 this is the starting point where you want 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.350
 throw objects and the chest where 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.800
 will appear at the end good and here you go 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.800
 big pain 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.230
 the hopper picks up everything 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.030
 it's gone a little bit outside the shot 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.540
 flowers in the peat of the cradle 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.840
 of the trolley picks up the loose in 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.050
 this grants that is here below is what 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.330
 put in the oven and in the oven and here goes 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.060
 coming more and more from the oven 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.770
 is falling daily to the chest if 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.920
 Do you have any doubts about how to do it? 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.640
 this system comment on it in the video 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.160
 point to another please and like me and 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.490
 subscribe thank you for watching guido dÃ­az
