00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of the hardest to really break down so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.610 
process that up so now it's time to
actually<00:02:41.099> roll<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.120> into<00:02:42.450> individual<00:02:43.440> sized

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually roll it into individual sized

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
actually roll it into individual sized
balls<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.340> they're<00:02:44.670> easily<00:02:44.940> portable

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
balls so that they're easily portable

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
balls so that they're easily portable
and<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.260> perfect<00:02:46.590> little<00:02:46.769> snack<00:02:46.980> otherwise

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you'd eat the whole thing at once

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
you'd eat the whole thing at once
because<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.590> good<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.459> you're<00:02:50.549> just

gonna grab about I don't know a golf
ball<00:02:53.849> sized<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:55.140> might<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.530> too

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
ball sized that might be a little too

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.630 
ball sized that might be a little too
big<00:02:56.480> break<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> piece<00:02:57.780> off

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
big break a piece off

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.930 
big break a piece off
just<00:02:59.640> roll<00:02:59.940> it<00:02:59.970> between<00:03:00.269> your<00:03:00.510> two<00:03:00.840> hands

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
just roll it between your two hands

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.440 
just roll it between your two hands
there<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> go

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
there you go

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.640 
there you go
and<00:03:04.139> you<00:03:04.470> got<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.989> repeat<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.380> process

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and you got one and repeat the process

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.580 
and you got one and repeat the process
until<00:03:08.190> you've<00:03:08.549> used<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.019> dough<00:03:10.200> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
until you've used all of the dough I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.400 
until you've used all of the dough I
would<00:03:11.280> say<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.519> makes<00:03:11.760> about<00:03:12.030> two<00:03:12.540> dozen<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
would say it makes about two dozen it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.259 
would say it makes about two dozen it
kind<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.650> depends<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.160> size<00:03:14.340> though<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
kind of depends on the size though you

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.059 
kind of depends on the size though you
know<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.420> could<00:03:15.660> go<00:03:15.780> bigger<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.920> make

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
know you could go bigger I like to make

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.830 
know you could go bigger I like to make
them<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> little<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.519> smaller<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.540> feel

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
them a little bit smaller so I like feel

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.449 
them a little bit smaller so I like feel
like<00:03:18.870> I'm<00:03:19.079> indulging<00:03:19.230> by<00:03:19.709> eating<00:03:20.040> two<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.310> once
