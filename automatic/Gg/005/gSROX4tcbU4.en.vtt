00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, Valery Minkina and you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.929
 last part 5 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.889
 video about how to collect all the same mida 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.859
 minx pride because in fact 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.350
 assembly is pretty not difficult but 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.180
 the difficulty is here the last layer 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.480
 but I think it makes no sense to show everything 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 algorithms that exist on the Internet 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 because several assembly techniques 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 megamix and the last layer I just 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.550
 I wrote you here it is a site that contains 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.800
 in itself about 45 50 thousand algorithms for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 all puzzles 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 where it is necessary to throw a link to it yet 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 in the description under the video and in general that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.700
 this site you will go there will be a section 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.100
 mega minx and 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.370
 let's say it will be the last layer 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.059
 it is written that there you player in general all 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 affairs and what is this last layer how about 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 collect in general there algorithm and select 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.830
 most comfortable but again I say 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.640
 what's the point of showing network algorithm 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.030
 No, because everything exists very much 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 a lot and besides 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.659
 of all let's say you show show 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.689
 on a specific example 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.740
 the same is possible but it is not a hunt for me 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:30.630
 because the last layer consists of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.850
 the fact that it does not need to understand it is necessary to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.560
 In general, a formula to gather up if we are here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 somehow looking for something collected 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.810
 triple double blocks then actually 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.000
 saying here we will apply the form but 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 if it is rude to say first we will collect 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.220
 star then we collect the right one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 a star then like Rubik's cubes 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.399
 we will put all angles orient 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.939
 right on the last side 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.390
 that is, so that the side of us was 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.610
 collected and forth 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 in general, we will replace all the angles that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.880
 we already have 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.770
 because well, in general, a lot of techniques I 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 I collect not by Frederick because 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.660
 megamix never more at a speed of 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.600
 I collected here only for 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.910
 in addition only because I would say 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.020
 because it is very interesting 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.360
 puzzle so here well here i am her in 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.670
 Basically collected that is, everything is pretty 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.010
 it is very clear nothing complicated 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.739
 I repeat once again on this website 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.770
 You can find all the algorithms and be sure 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.760
 under the video I throw them to you 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.010
 ease the search 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.150
 Thank you all for watching goodbye to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.150
 you were small Valery
