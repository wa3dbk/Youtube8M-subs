00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.570
WILL HELP THEM LOCATE A

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.340
SUSPECT.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.710
MIKE CRONIN JOINS US NOW LIVE

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.440
WITH MORE.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.380
THIS THING IS GIANT, IT

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.380
INFLATES ALL THE

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.540
WAY TO THE ROOF

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.510
OF THIS FAMILY'S HOUSE.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.580
KIDS IN THE CONCORD NEIGHBORHOOD

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.710
LOVE THIS SANTA CLAUS,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.680
AND

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.820
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.620
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND TIME

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.590
THIS SANTA HAS BEEN SLASHED.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.720
WHILE THE OWNERS SAY THEY CAN

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.590
SEE SOME HUMOR IN ALL THIS, BUT

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.660
IN THE END

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.590
THEY SAY IT'S

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.660
UNCALLED FOR AND FRANKLY A

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.830
DISTURBING CRIME.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.600
IT'S THE KIND OF CRIME THAT

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.730
WOULD PUT THIS GUY ON THE

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.900
NAUGHTY

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.840
LIST.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.170
THEY LIVE ON RIDGE ROAD IN

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.840
CONCORD.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.010
EVERY CHRISTMAS SEASON THEY

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.940
BLOW

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.940
UP THEIR 20-FOOT TALL INFLATABLE

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.740
SANTA CLAUS.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.880
MAYBE A LITTLE

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.980
TACKY, BUT

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.880
IT'S A COMMUNITY THING.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.920
TWO DAYS AFTER CHRISTMAS AT

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.180
4:30 IN THE MORNING

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.050
A YOUNG MAN

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.450
TOOK ALL THE JOY OUT OF THEIR

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.090
FRONT LAWN.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.920
IT WAS ALL CAUGHT

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.990
ON CAMERA.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.130
WALKS UP TO THE LAWN ORNAMENT

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.360
AND SLASHES IT WITH A

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.030
KNIFE OR

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.200
SOME TYPE OF CUTTING INSTRUMENT

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.100
AND WALKS OFF INTO THE NIGHT.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.300
OH MY

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.400
GOODNESS, THAT'S AWFUL.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130
CHRIS AND HER HUSBAND DID

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.240
THEIR BEST TO PIECE THE GIANT

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.270
SANTA BACK

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.570
TOGETHER, WITH DUCT

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.370
TAPE.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.340
ALMOST LIKE A C-SECTION SCAR,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.270
THAT MAY BE

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.480
TOO GRAPHIC, BUT HE

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.310
HAS A LITTLE SCAR ON HIS BELLY.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.550
THEY GOT THE FOOTAGE THANKS

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.620
TO A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA THEY

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.450
INSTALLED THIS WINTER.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.720
IT NOT THE FIRST TIME SANTA HAS

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.650
BEEN VICTIMIZED.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.590
IN 2013 THEY SAY SOMEONE SLASHED

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.760
SANTA IN THE

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.590
BACK.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.930
THEY PUT THE CAMERA IN THEIR

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.760
TREE TO SEE IF IT WOULD HAPPEN

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.230
AGAIN.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.830
IT'S SAD.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.630
THERE IS SOME ANGER MANAGEMENT

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.800
OUT THERE, EITHER AGAINST

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.170
CHRISTMAS OR

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.770
INFLATABLE SAN AS

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.970
THE OR SOMETHING.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.070
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO DID IT

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.900
OR WHY IT HAPPENED.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.740
POLICE

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.010
ARE WONDERING IF OTHERS

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.210
WERE VANDALIZED.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.410
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.940
BECAUSE

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.080
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS OUT AT 4:30

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.050
IN THE MORNING WEARING A HEAD

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.050
LAMP AND CARRYING A

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.080
BACKPACK, SO

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.420
WE'D LIKE TO IDENTIFY THIS

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.150
PERSON.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.450
AS FOR NEXT YEAR,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.290
SHE SAYS HER

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.190
KIDS WANT TO GET A BLOWUP

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.160
SNOWMAN, BUT AFTER THIS SHE'S

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.530
NOT SO SURE.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.230
I'M THINKING WE'RE PROBABLY

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.130
GOING TO STAY AWAY.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.260
JUST

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.300
LIGHTS.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.300
IT'S UNKNOWN IF THIS IS THE

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300
SAME SUSPECT AS LAST YEAR, AND

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.470
POLICE DON'T KNOW IF IT

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.370
WAS A

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.670
RANDOM ACT.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.470
THEY ARE ASKING ANYONE WITH ANY

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.470
INFORMATION TO CONTACT THEM.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.840
AS FOR SANTA,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570
HE'S BEEN ROLLED

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.860
UP AND PUT AWAY FOR THE SEASON,
