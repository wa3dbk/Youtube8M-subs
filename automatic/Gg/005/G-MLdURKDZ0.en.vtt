00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.360
 it makes sense in the fifth period title but then it must win 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.730
 in leeuwarden from cambuur 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.730
 van thiel concludes with this 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 the rose dealers 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.380
 mother of rbc mels van driel 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.119
 and then you can call this a dream start for the team of trainer rini 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 cool 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.880
 He realizes a very bad season 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.699
 robbie meppelink sno mostly as a trainer 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.020
 but that can all be made right 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.800
 with that fifth period title here is from triple 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.780
 off again 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.940
 the doctors can only do that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 finally becomes clumsy way 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 paul beekmans too 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 cambuur dinges in trouble in the opening phase 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 and there is Sjoerd Ars 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.290
 how hot it is 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 a defeat at emmen 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 but before that win three times in a row for rcc roosendaal 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.740
 has been in shape the last few weeks scored three times in the last four 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 jordan remacle 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 but we are more 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
 young goalkeeper for the Brabant players 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.419
 although not over 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.809
 with the situation 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.809
 then search to shorten playback options 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.519
 not at all read more tk the condition of these two gentlemen 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 play dannatt antwerpen 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.149
 by a goal in injury time for you 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.409
 dangerously miss missi again 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.269
 not really dangerous for that 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.499
 rbc 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.449
 christ an one 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.559
 and remarkable again just like last week that trainer Stanley Menzo 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:05.400
 very long on the field to analyze the molestation as everything and everyone all 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.399
 a wide sigh in the dressing room 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.659
 odd ritual of the man who therefore sign for a year 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:33.259
 with two legs ahead of the 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.879
 yes those your kids 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.099
 he may have to give you the bread for triple 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.509
 last season also twice red now again so early to the side 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.889
 and so the challenge is to win here 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.889
 a bit trickier for being described there 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:05.369
 and there comes 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.369
 so good on earth 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.389
 an exciting competition 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.809
 both teams if possible can try to look up davo and that's how it should be 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.879
 martien 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.879
 stitch ball on today 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 from pietersma 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 ten are ruined 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.259
 fools 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.930
 that is certainly the people 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.419
 already in the hands of pietersma 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.559
 kept in that match 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.340
 the 21 year old 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 from rbc 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.779
 she does not harm it either 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.139
 what's in gent 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.120
 pietersma no chance 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.250
 and thanks to a former addition certain regard, cambuur is now ahead 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.370
 Hermes and you must come then 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.189
 this has nothing to lose anymore 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.699
 Sjoerd Ars 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.699
 alexander 9 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.219
 or take a seat and 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:01.309
