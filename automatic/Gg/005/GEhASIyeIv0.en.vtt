00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.289 

when<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> first<00:00:04.529> saw<00:00:04.740> saw<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.460> each<00:00:05.700> stick<00:00:06.089> has

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
when I first saw saw that each stick has

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.860 
when I first saw saw that each stick has
its<00:00:06.450> own<00:00:06.600> mold<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.319> couldn't<00:00:08.160> believe<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:09.210> always

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
its own mold I couldn't believe I always

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.720 
its own mold I couldn't believe I always
thought<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> lay<00:00:10.590> there<00:00:10.950> were<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.639> know

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
thought it was a lay there were you know

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.310 
thought it was a lay there were you know
I<00:00:11.759> never<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.750> thought<00:00:12.780> through<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
I never really thought through the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.090 
I never really thought through the
process<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.549> design<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.980> know

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
process of how the design was you know

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.359 
process of how the design was you know
put<00:00:17.400> onto<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> stick<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.330> grinding<00:00:18.810> process

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
put onto the stick the grinding process

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.140 
put onto the stick the grinding process
where<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> sticks<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.240> shaped<00:00:22.820> by<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> use

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
where the sticks are shaped by the use

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.259 
where the sticks are shaped by the use
of<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:24.890> rhinestones<00:00:25.890> versus<00:00:26.580> being<00:00:26.939> turned

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
of these rhinestones versus being turned

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.250 
of these rhinestones versus being turned
on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> lathe<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.170> cut<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> knife<00:00:30.260> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on the lathe and cut with a knife that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
on the lathe and cut with a knife that
was<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> most<00:00:31.679> impressive<00:00:31.980> part<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> tour

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
was the most impressive part of the tour

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
was the most impressive part of the tour
for<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.329> other<00:00:34.290> manufacturers<00:00:35.040> use

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
for me other manufacturers use

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
for me other manufacturers use
traditional<00:00:35.610> wood<00:00:36.180> turning<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.719> shape<00:00:36.899> their

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
traditional wood turning to shape their

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.100 
traditional wood turning to shape their
sticks<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.430> Vic<00:00:38.579> Firth<00:00:38.790> our<00:00:39.329> method<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sticks here at Vic Firth our method is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.160 
sticks here at Vic Firth our method is
far<00:00:40.260> superior<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.820> process<00:00:42.329> where

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
far superior to that the process where

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
far superior to that the process where
stick<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.710> turned<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> lathe<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> cut<00:00:44.969> by<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
stick is turned on a lathe and cut by a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
stick is turned on a lathe and cut by a
knife<00:00:46.100> always<00:00:47.329> struck<00:00:48.329> me<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.510> being<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.260> way

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
knife always struck me as being one way

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.100 
knife always struck me as being one way
there<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> potential<00:00:50.700> for

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
there was a lot of potential for

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.660 
there was a lot of potential for
tolerances<00:00:52.110> getting<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.739> wide<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
tolerances getting kind of wide the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.939 
tolerances getting kind of wide the
blades<00:00:54.030> gonna<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.780> dull<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> goes<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
blades gonna get more dull as it goes on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
blades gonna get more dull as it goes on
and<00:00:56.100> goes<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.030> tolerances<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.660> going

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and goes on and the tolerances are going

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.279 
and goes on and the tolerances are going
to<00:00:57.840> change<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.410> grinding<00:00:58.949> process<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.809> much

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to change the grinding process is a much

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.289 
to change the grinding process is a much
more<00:01:01.789> consistent<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.830> reliable<00:01:04.970> way<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
more consistent and reliable way to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.010 
more consistent and reliable way to
produce<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.939> sticks<00:01:09.479> without

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
produce the different sticks without

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
produce the different sticks without
having<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.650> results<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> laving<00:01:11.909> against

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
having two results in the laving against

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
having two results in the laving against
the<00:01:12.360> blade<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:13.350> you're<00:01:13.470> leading<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.070> stick

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the blade when you're leading a stick

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
the blade when you're leading a stick
like<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> depending<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.409> much

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
like that and and depending on how much

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
like that and and depending on how much
it's<00:01:16.770> cutting<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.729> given<00:01:18.360> time<00:01:18.570> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it's cutting off at one given time like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's cutting off at one given time like
it's<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.770> dramatically<00:01:20.430> affecting<00:01:21.150> like

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's really dramatically affecting like

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.760 
it's really dramatically affecting like
the<00:01:22.250> stress<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> stick<00:01:24.180> itself<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.619> mean

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the stress on the stick itself so I mean

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
the stress on the stick itself so I mean
it<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.070> break<00:01:26.250> easier<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.119> snap<00:01:27.330> easier

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it can break easier can snap easier

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
it can break easier can snap easier
you're<00:01:27.900> putting<00:01:28.170> less<00:01:28.350> stress<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.280> wood

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you're putting less stress on the wood

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.260 
you're putting less stress on the wood
and<00:01:30.229> as<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.340> opposed<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> lathe

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and as you would as opposed to the lathe

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
and as you would as opposed to the lathe
which<00:01:34.110> makes<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.490> better<00:01:35.729> quality

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
which makes it have way better quality

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
which makes it have way better quality
product<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> end<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> day<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:38.040> you're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
product at the end of the day if you're

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
product at the end of the day if you're
not<00:01:38.659> maintaining<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.689> blade<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> way<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
not maintaining that blade the way that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
not maintaining that blade the way that
it<00:01:40.619> needs<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> maintained<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it needs to be maintained from what I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
it needs to be maintained from what I
understand<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> starts<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> produce

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
understand then that starts to produce

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.830 
understand then that starts to produce
very<00:01:45.630> irregular<00:01:46.280> cuts<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.030> sticks<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
very irregular cuts and and sticks as a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
very irregular cuts and and sticks as a
result<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> thing<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
result so that's the thing about the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
result so that's the thing about the
back<00:01:50.880> knives<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
back knives is that they have to be

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
back knives is that they have to be
sharpened<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.700> stone<00:01:54.090> mold<00:01:54.630> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
sharpened all the time the stone mold is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.520 
sharpened all the time the stone mold is
a<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.799> accurate<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a much more accurate way to get to the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
a much more accurate way to get to the
exact<00:01:59.040> shape<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.659> stick<00:02:01.670> without<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
exact shape of the stick without in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.469 
exact shape of the stick without in
chipping<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:03.990> extra<00:02:04.829> pieces<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.430> wood<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:07.009> or

it's<00:04:31.360> tough<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.900> durable<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:33.130> some<00:04:33.310> companies

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
it's tough and durable so some companies

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.240 
it's tough and durable so some companies
have<00:04:33.940> got<00:04:34.120> higher<00:04:34.419> moisture<00:04:34.750> content<00:04:35.250> because

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
have got higher moisture content because

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.700 
have got higher moisture content because
when<00:04:36.940> they're<00:04:37.090> using<00:04:37.300> knives<00:04:37.840> cutting<00:04:38.410> the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
when they're using knives cutting the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.610 
when they're using knives cutting the
wood<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.639> easier<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.210> work<00:04:40.360> with<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.900> thick

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
wood it's easier to work with and thick

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.710 
wood it's easier to work with and thick
which<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.580> bad<00:04:42.820> thing<00:04:43.120> because<00:04:43.330> when<00:04:43.630> you

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
which is a bad thing because when you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.900 
which is a bad thing because when you
hit<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> knot<00:04:44.229> big<00:04:44.860> chunks<00:04:45.220> of<00:04:45.310> wood<00:04:45.460> fly<00:04:45.729> off

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
hit a knot big chunks of wood fly off

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.870 
hit a knot big chunks of wood fly off
but<00:04:46.600> Vic<00:04:46.810> did<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.139> they<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.680> clever<00:04:47.949> way<00:04:48.220> by

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
but Vic did it they the clever way by

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:59.040 
but Vic did it they the clever way by

grinding it on a stone I think it's the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.770
