00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.310

 There are two ways to connect: Bluetooth and line input. 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.070
 You can also connect tf memory directly, or use usb memory 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 You can 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:47.370
 Uh thanks for the Eastern Bluetooth if Bluetooth donggeu with Bluetooth built-in by default 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.180
 If you use it at an unreachable distance 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 It was a struggle and a weakness, 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.579
 Microphones that come with the answer I'll show you it's Goya 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.300
 It turns on music like karaoke, and 5% on Mike Ball. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.130
 Then you can wear this on your shoulder, 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:21.180
 If you can afford to buy something or carry something when you are doing it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.480
 Uh Then something while'd yet available 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480
 first 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.490
 When you listen to music year when the framework 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.649
 Play music on your smartphone and it can also be played with line input . 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.869
 When you turn on the power . 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.869
 I'm writing it, but do you think it's over? 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.710
 The first is the line input, but next to the two-in-one, the bit is changed to the bit 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.380
 It's changed to Bluetooth mode. 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.730
 If you change the RBI input team leader basically if what you already mp3 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 When you have a player or something, you can connect the speaker directly to the line 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.750
 I hear it. 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.750
 First of all , first of all , 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.760
 I'm talking. 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.110
 Then I think this is the audio population 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.110
 And I see that chapter . 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990
 4 Fee Baby It's hard to be cooked 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.520
 It's a big deal. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.520
 Well, just try to put 5 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.880
 Let's just turn it on to lower it. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.890
 It's too big an investment for a solo overkill. 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.730
 Also raise your smartphone volume 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.290
 The loudspeakers look crazy 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.370
 I'll tell you when you're at home with your 1st home on YouTube 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.370
 Let's check pancreas. 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 What went Youtube lift Yes 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.299
 I'll try to override a video geomut once even playing this course sounds 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.299
 I will. 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.980
 Issues in atmosphere i5 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.610
 Hand over 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.510
 This is also introduced . 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.510
 So let's say something and there through the night and hangeonga broadcast 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.250
 I have a microphone now . 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.450
 In the past few changes to be approximately equal to the bikes Journal contribution plan, I eat now 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.459
 That's what it was then. 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.459
 Oh, at least, let's substitute the word ah 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:53.290
 It's coming out of a couple of loudspeakers. 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:57.700
 This is Amarton speaking from the speaker and then when I meet you, 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:02.079
 That's right. He's five fingers. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:08.110
 So if zest possible to ttoma Turner status to a comfortable state 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:12.540
 Now, we're off the line this time . It would be uncomfortable to connect this way . 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.540
 First , go into the Lotus Domino Administrator 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:26.090
 Let's take a look at this one. Now it's called t pbt ball. 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.219
 This is the first time you have a couple 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.969
 I have my expressions. 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:34.430
 I will do the light. I can not take it . 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.580
 I'll change it to bt. 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 And let's think about it again. 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.430
 Cooking is complete. 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:48.339
 Then there will be a lot of evaluation. 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.870
 2 What is it 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.300
 On the way out 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:11.650
 I am good and I will sing as a friend 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:16.300
 I'll roll something else in the North. I turn on foo 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.360
 I can turn the tech on and make sure the expert is a lot of English. 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.360
 I have a microphone blues and I can make a microphone too big 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.190
 222 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.820
 For actual use rattling 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.140
 Can I use a lot of things ? 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:38.200
 Because it acts like a loudspeaker, 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:42.580
 Because you can input and speak 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.370
 Well put off spread to the business and we will do what simyeon uh this is good 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.860
 I guess I can use it when I say something like that. 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:54.250
 Do not get the sound of the songs from the five outdoor'm emitter and put the microphone like a bread wrap 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.990
 You can use it when you do not turn around and sing a song. 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:02.530
 Because it supports various input methods, it can connect smartphone station 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.190
 You can also exclude the existing mp3 player or cd player 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.820
 I have. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.970
 Cozy simple music which I edaga times the amount of hair eojjae deokhu 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.260
 You can dispose of the profits and because there is a number on the remote control, 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:18.460
 I can choose the next number without pressing the number. 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:22.060
 So I have a lot of features , 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:27.400
 Microphone jack also look at the recent First's Mike's 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:29.170
 It's just possible to do it wirelessly when you already have a wired microphone 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.670
 In that case, I'll be composing 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:39.280
 This town air pipe microphone jack large even this is a clear connection from the charge area to the 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:44.080
 And just and again just to say that song that also called micro music 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:48.330
 Something to call or say something or a bunch of people 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:52.560
 You can talk about it or you can use it like that. 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.370
 4 I've just looked at a portable wireless microphone speaker . 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.370
 It's data.
