00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
are two right then we used to write like

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569 
are two right then we used to write like
this<00:01:57.750> structure<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.500> represent<00:01:59.070> them<00:01:59.220> like

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this structure to represent them like

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.999 
this structure to represent them like
this<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.600> figure<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
this like this figure right like this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.670 
this like this figure right like this
number<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.149> digit<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.990> represent<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
number this digit to represent this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
number this digit to represent this
represent<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.420> whenever<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.840> get

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
represent this right so whenever you get

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
represent this right so whenever you get
two<00:02:07.259> balls<00:02:07.469> or<00:02:07.860> two<00:02:08.040> apples<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:08.940> fingers

two balls or two apples or two fingers

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.900 
two balls or two apples or two fingers
right<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.530> simply<00:02:10.950> write<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.370> -

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
right then you can simply write this -

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.910 
right then you can simply write this -
but<00:02:12.629> how<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> write<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.620> -

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
but how to write this -

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150

how<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.569> write<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.050> two<00:02:26.430> simple<00:02:27.430> C<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:27.760> like

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
how to write this two simple C just like

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.050 
how to write this two simple C just like
this<00:02:28.120> snake<00:02:28.630> will<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.440> making<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.830> carve<00:02:30.160> line<00:02:30.700> C

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
this snake will be making a carve line C

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.590 
this snake will be making a carve line C
just<00:02:31.990> like<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.380> snake<00:02:32.709> make<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> car<00:02:33.610> of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
just like this a snake make a car of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.080 
just like this a snake make a car of
line<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.080> go<00:02:35.290> down<00:02:35.530> steering<00:02:36.310> slanted<00:02:36.910> way

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
line and go down steering slanted way

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.010 
line and go down steering slanted way
right<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:38.050> diagonal<00:02:38.980> way<00:02:39.250> yeah<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:40.600> make

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
right in diagonal way yeah and now make

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.900 
right in diagonal way yeah and now make
a<00:02:41.050> straight<00:02:41.620> line<00:02:42.360> right<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.319> called<00:02:44.530> -

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
a straight line right this is called -

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.180 
a straight line right this is called -
quite<00:02:45.910> simple<00:02:46.300> right<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.110> let's<00:02:47.650> make<00:02:47.890> once

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
quite simple right so let's make once

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.030 
quite simple right so let's make once
again<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.170> snake<00:02:50.380> hook<00:02:50.800> like<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
again like this is snake hook like a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.550 
again like this is snake hook like a
structure<00:02:51.459> right<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:51.820> just<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> hook<00:02:52.560> so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
structure right it's just like a hook so

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.640 
structure right it's just like a hook so
I'm<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:54.040> making<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.489> hook<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.970> structure

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I'm just making a hook like a structure

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.490 
I'm just making a hook like a structure
yes<00:02:56.650> now<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.730> perfect<00:02:58.000> book<00:02:58.390> now<00:02:59.170> a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
yes now this is my perfect book now a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.190 
yes now this is my perfect book now a
straight<00:03:00.160> line<00:03:00.640> or<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
straight line or you can see the the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.630 
straight line or you can see the the
base<00:03:02.470> line<00:03:02.800> right<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.180> once<00:03:04.360> again<00:03:05.459> for<00:03:06.459> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
base line right so once again for this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.810 
base line right so once again for this
boil<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.180> I'm<00:03:07.330> making<00:03:07.690> one<00:03:07.870> two<00:03:08.110> right<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.370> he

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
boil so I'm making one two right so he

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.570 
boil so I'm making one two right so he
doesn't<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.300> how<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.600> write<00:03:11.019> two<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.739> we

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
doesn't know how to write two but we

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.490 
doesn't know how to write two but we
know<00:03:12.730> how<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.970> write<00:03:13.180> two<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.200> let's

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
know how to write two right so let's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.520 
know how to write two right so let's
teach<00:03:14.769> him<00:03:15.010> how<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> write<00:03:15.610> two<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.630> tell<00:03:17.500> it

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
teach him how to write two so tell it

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.640 
teach him how to write two so tell it
let's<00:03:18.040> tell<00:03:18.280> him<00:03:18.430> hey<00:03:19.000> make<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.170> hook<00:03:20.410> like<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
let's tell him hey make the hook like a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
let's tell him hey make the hook like a
structure<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:23.019> base<00:03:23.500> line

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
structure like this and a base line

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.630 
structure like this and a base line
right<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.810> then<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.440> will<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.799> exactly<00:03:27.280> to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
right and then it will be exactly to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.440 
right and then it will be exactly to
what<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.030> want<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> say<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.440> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
what you want to say this is this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
what you want to say this is this
instead<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.600> showing<00:03:31.810> two<00:03:32.110> fingers<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.980> can

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
instead of showing two fingers you can

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.479 
instead of showing two fingers you can
write<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:34.079> write<00:03:35.079> like<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.530> later<00:03:36.220> or

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
write like this write like this later or

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.759 
write like this write like this later or
numbers<00:03:37.090> or<00:03:37.120> digit<00:03:37.690> two<00:03:38.079> represents<00:03:38.560> two

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
numbers or digit two represents two

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.259 
numbers or digit two represents two
apples<00:03:39.280> or<00:03:39.430> two<00:03:39.930> balls<00:03:40.930> right<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:43.030> think

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
apples or two balls right so now I think

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.449 
apples or two balls right so now I think
you<00:03:43.540> learn<00:03:43.750> how<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.049> write<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.010> let's<00:03:45.250> make

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
you learn how to write so let's make

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.240 
you learn how to write so let's make
some<00:03:45.489> practice<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.390> again<00:03:47.380> tell<00:03:47.680> your<00:03:47.799> dad<00:03:48.010> or

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
some practice and again tell your dad or

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.460 
some practice and again tell your dad or

this right so again I'm going to write
here<00:04:12.010> now<00:04:12.220> look<00:04:13.030> like<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.299> structure<00:04:13.840> right

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
here now look like a structure right

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.289 
here now look like a structure right
okay<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.690> baseline<00:04:17.320> right<00:04:18.130> again<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
okay and then baseline right again the

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.810 
okay and then baseline right again the
hawk<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.870> structure<00:04:20.590> and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
hawk like structure and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.140 
hawk like structure and
please<00:04:22.510> line<00:04:23.100> again<00:04:24.100> hook<00:04:24.430> like<00:04:24.790> it's<00:04:24.940> toxic

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
please line again hook like it's toxic

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.280 
please line again hook like it's toxic
RV<00:04:25.840> line<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.440> then<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.810> hook

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
RV line and then like this right hook

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.470 
RV line and then like this right hook
like<00:04:29.650> snake<00:04:30.070> like<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> structure<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.210> then

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
like snake like a structure and then

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.010 
like snake like a structure and then
like<00:04:31.630> this

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
like this

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.100 
like this
so<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.920> is<00:04:33.100> my<00:04:33.310> snake<00:04:33.670> like<00:04:34.150> structure<00:04:34.720> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
so this is my snake like structure and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.000 
so this is my snake like structure and
then<00:04:35.440> baseline<00:04:36.190> right<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:38.350> can<00:04:38.500> lift<00:04:38.710> your

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
then baseline right you can lift your

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.660 
then baseline right you can lift your
hand<00:04:39.580> also<00:04:40.080> after<00:04:41.080> writing<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.890> then

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
hand also after writing this and then

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.850 
hand also after writing this and then
you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.210> give<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.510> baseline<00:04:44.020> nice<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:46.860> hook

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
you can give a baseline nice so hook

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.980 
you can give a baseline nice so hook
just<00:04:48.040> make<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.340> hook<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.820> then<00:04:49.150> give<00:04:49.450> baseline

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
just make a hook and then give baseline

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.640 
just make a hook and then give baseline
or<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:52.150> will<00:04:52.300> be<00:04:52.420> more<00:04:52.630> better<00:04:52.810> if<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.230> do

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
or you it will be more better if you do

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.750 
or you it will be more better if you do
not<00:04:53.770> lift<00:04:54.430> up<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.790> pain<00:04:55.000> just<00:04:55.660> right<00:04:56.110> at<00:04:56.350> once

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
not lift up the pain just right at once

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.490 
not lift up the pain just right at once
hook<00:04:57.760> like<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.000> structure<00:04:58.480> and<00:04:58.720> then<00:04:59.050> like<00:04:59.260> this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
hook like a structure and then like this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.820 
hook like a structure and then like this
right<00:05:00.000> writing<00:05:01.000> over<00:05:01.390> this<00:05:02.970> grace<00:05:04.500> -<00:05:05.500> it's

okay that's great your writing very nice
great<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.960> first<00:05:14.290> making<00:05:14.740> hook<00:05:15.070> like<00:05:15.310> a

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
great so first making hook like a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.280 
great so first making hook like a
structure<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.150> then<00:05:16.420> a<00:05:16.480> straight<00:05:16.840> line<00:05:17.080> down

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
structure and then a straight line down

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.100 
structure and then a straight line down
steer<00:05:17.740> again<00:05:18.400> look<00:05:18.910> like<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> structure<00:05:19.750> and

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
steer again look like a structure and

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.180 
steer again look like a structure and
then<00:05:21.360> baseline<00:05:22.360> right<00:05:22.630> it's<00:05:23.020> quite<00:05:23.380> easy<00:05:23.620> see

then baseline right it's quite easy see
it's<00:05:24.400> looking<00:05:24.640> same<00:05:25.090> right<00:05:25.600> try<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.290> do<00:05:27.160> this

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
it's looking same right try to do this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.960 
it's looking same right try to do this

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
all right and see here we have to write

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.930 
all right and see here we have to write
ourselves<00:05:31.780> so<00:05:32.350> again<00:05:33.120> look<00:05:34.120> like<00:05:34.420> a<00:05:34.450> structure
