00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and we waited a little ponder like this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.360

cats okay and the cats just sitting
there<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.430> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
there like this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.390 
there like this
that's<00:02:29.600> right<00:02:29.780> human<00:02:30.050> be<00:02:30.260> afraid<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.860> me<00:02:31.010> human

that's right human be afraid of me human

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560 
that's right human be afraid of me human
so<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.700> think<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.060> point<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:32.480> getting

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
so I think the point that we're getting

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.510 
so I think the point that we're getting
in<00:02:32.780> here<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.260> people<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.770> Korea<00:02:34.070> aren't

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
in here is that people in Korea aren't

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.460 
in here is that people in Korea aren't
as<00:02:34.640> comfortable<00:02:34.880> as<00:02:35.209> pets<00:02:35.540> yet<00:02:35.870> as<00:02:36.080> they<00:02:36.260> are

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
as comfortable as pets yet as they are

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.530 
as comfortable as pets yet as they are
in<00:02:36.739> Western<00:02:37.280> countries<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.820> North<00:02:38.060> America

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
in Western countries like North America

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.150 
in Western countries like North America
or<00:02:38.630> England<00:02:38.750> or<00:02:39.110> Europe<00:02:39.140> or<00:02:39.530> whatnot<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.950> think

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
or England or Europe or whatnot I think

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.410 
or England or Europe or whatnot I think
they<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.250> haven't<00:02:40.610> been<00:02:40.670> exposed<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.270> in

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
they just haven't been exposed to it in

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.120 
they just haven't been exposed to it in
a<00:02:41.480> household<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:42.260> they<00:02:42.320> see<00:02:42.380> an<00:02:42.739> animal<00:02:43.070> I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
a household so when they see an animal I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.560 
a household so when they see an animal I
think<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.459> as<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> wild<00:02:44.180> animal

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
think of it as like a wild animal

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.910 
think of it as like a wild animal
rather<00:02:44.780> than<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.200> something<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:45.800> be

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
rather than like something that can be

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.800 
rather than like something that can be
loved<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.640> snuggled<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.209> used<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.480> dance<00:02:47.660> in

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
loved and snuggled and used to dance in

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
that's it did it so we decided to get a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.670 
that's it did it so we decided to get a
kid<00:04:08.000> instead<00:04:08.210> in<00:04:08.540> hopes<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:08.960> if<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.470> kid

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
kid instead in hopes that if the kid

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.320 
kid instead in hopes that if the kid
would<00:04:09.920> grow<00:04:10.100> up<00:04:10.130> with<00:04:10.520> spudgy<00:04:10.910> she<00:04:11.090> would<00:04:11.210> be<00:04:11.300> a

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
would grow up with spudgy she would be a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.030 
would grow up with spudgy she would be a
lot<00:04:11.600> more<00:04:11.780> comfortable<00:04:12.050> with<00:04:12.440> our<00:04:12.590> dog<00:04:12.770> now

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
the second problem is that we really

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.030 
the second problem is that we really
wanted<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.840> get<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:14.990> Scottish<00:04:15.410> Fold<00:04:15.440> kitten

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
because we heard that they're very

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.699
