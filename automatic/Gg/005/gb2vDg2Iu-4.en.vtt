00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
we're gonna put it through the system

we're gonna put it through the system
here<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.070> our<00:00:47.070> next<00:00:47.250> stop<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.299 

all<00:00:56.320> right<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:56.469> spent<00:00:56.769> about<00:00:56.829> an<00:00:57.010> hour<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.190> a

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
all right I spent about an hour and a

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.119 
all right I spent about an hour and a
half<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.820> we<00:00:58.780> run<00:00:58.989> through<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.320> blasting

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
half and we run through the blasting

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.759 
half and we run through the blasting
cycle<00:01:00.460> here<00:01:00.670> after<00:01:00.909> we<00:01:01.000> got<00:01:01.089> out<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.769> the

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
cycle here after we got out of the the

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.960 
cycle here after we got out of the the
heater<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.489> as<00:01:03.969> you<00:01:04.119> can<00:01:04.269> see<00:01:04.570> it's<00:01:05.970> starting

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
heater and as you can see it's starting

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.050 
heater and as you can see it's starting
to<00:01:07.000> into<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.869> thing<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.259> beauty<00:01:08.290> here<00:01:08.799> at<00:01:09.759> least

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
to into a thing of beauty here at least

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.820 
to into a thing of beauty here at least
so<00:01:10.270> far<00:01:10.299> we<00:01:10.780> still<00:01:10.990> have<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> lot<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.409> work<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.710> do

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
so far we still have a lot of work to do

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.639 
so far we still have a lot of work to do
on<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.420> can<00:01:13.570> see<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:14.049> how<00:01:14.320> well

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
on this but you can see just how well

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.190 
on this but you can see just how well
the<00:01:15.280> thermal<00:01:15.640> close<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.390> cleaning<00:01:16.780> system

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the thermal close the cleaning system

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.029 
the thermal close the cleaning system
works<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:18.869> next<00:01:19.869> off<00:01:20.020> will<00:01:20.289> be<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.590> put<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:20.920> in

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
works and next off will be to put it in

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:32.340 
works and next off will be to put it in
the<00:01:21.159> tumbler<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.330> get<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> shot<00:01:22.840> out<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.200> it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.570 

well<00:01:33.350> these<00:01:33.620> are<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> heads<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.370> the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
well these are the heads out of the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.330 
well these are the heads out of the
Oldsmobile<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.960> they're<00:01:36.530> also<00:01:36.770> going<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.220> go

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
Oldsmobile and they're also going to go

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.289 
Oldsmobile and they're also going to go
through<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> process

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.800

they were and what they're gonna look
like<00:01:45.670> when<00:01:46.030> they<00:01:46.179> come<00:01:46.420> out

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190 

we're<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.150> be<00:01:51.270> installing<00:01:51.659> larger

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
we're also going to be installing larger

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
we're also going to be installing larger
intake<00:01:52.770> valves<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.369> possibly<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:54.060> larger

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
intake valves and possibly some larger

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.420 
intake valves and possibly some larger
exhaust<00:01:54.780> valves<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.259> SM

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.590 

well<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.580> cylinder<00:02:01.880> heads<00:02:02.060> are<00:02:02.210> nice<00:02:02.360> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
well the cylinder heads are nice and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.649 
well the cylinder heads are nice and
toasty<00:02:03.790> we'll<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.909> taking<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:05.330> out<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
toasty we'll be taking these out and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.710 
toasty we'll be taking these out and
putting<00:02:05.900> them<00:02:05.990> over<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.320> blaster<00:02:10.450> as<00:02:11.450> you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
putting them over in the blaster as you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.220 
putting them over in the blaster as you
move<00:02:11.870> over<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.709> blaster<00:02:13.959> take<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.989> little

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
move over to the blaster take a little

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.010 
move over to the blaster take a little
bit<00:02:15.380> better<00:02:15.560> look<00:02:15.950> at<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.560> see

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
bit better look at them as you can see

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.360 
bit better look at them as you can see
the<00:02:21.020> thermal<00:02:21.380> system<00:02:21.530> does<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.190> nice

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
the thermal system does a really nice

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.130 
the thermal system does a really nice
job<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:22.940> far<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.180> cleaning<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> rest<00:02:23.959> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
job as far as cleaning up the rest and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:52.220 
job as far as cleaning up the rest and
the<00:02:24.760> oil<00:02:25.760> that's<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.270> there

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.479 

the<00:02:53.230> heads<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.560> gone<00:02:53.770> through<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.099> blasting

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the heads have gone through the blasting

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.940 
the heads have gone through the blasting
process<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.160> think<00:02:57.190> as<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.950> they

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
process and I think as you can see they

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.809 
process and I think as you can see they
came<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.430> real<00:03:00.700> nice<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:06.160> all<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.670> do

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
came out real nice and all I have to do

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.550 
came out real nice and all I have to do
is<00:03:06.940> get<00:03:07.120> them<00:03:07.209> over<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.510> bench<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.319> we<00:03:08.410> can

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
is get them over on the bench so we can

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.009 
is get them over on the bench so we can
start<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.980> repair<00:03:09.280> process<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:12.780> we'll<00:03:13.780> show

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
start the repair process and we'll show

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.540 
start the repair process and we'll show
you<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.470> another<00:03:14.500> video
