00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.059 

you<00:00:04.910> know<00:00:05.000> I<00:00:05.300> you<00:00:06.050> got<00:00:06.230> to<00:00:06.350> give<00:00:06.470> a<00:00:06.500> lock-in

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
you know I you got to give a lock-in

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.190 
you know I you got to give a lock-in
credit<00:00:07.730> then<00:00:07.910> came<00:00:08.090> out<00:00:08.299> and<00:00:08.540> took<00:00:08.690> it<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:08.900> us

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
credit then came out and took it to us

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.570 
credit then came out and took it to us
right<00:00:09.230> away<00:00:09.820> and<00:00:10.820> I<00:00:10.850> think<00:00:11.090> our<00:00:11.240> defense

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
right away and I think our defense

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.650 
right away and I think our defense
obviously<00:00:13.580> didn't<00:00:13.849> perform<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.269> way<00:00:14.360> we're

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
obviously didn't perform the way we're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.230 
obviously didn't perform the way we're
capable<00:00:14.690> than<00:00:15.469> that<00:00:15.620> first<00:00:15.920> drive<00:00:16.219> probably<00:00:17.210> a

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
capable than that first drive probably a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.450 
capable than that first drive probably a
wake-up<00:00:17.480> call<00:00:17.689> that<00:00:17.990> these<00:00:18.740> guys<00:00:18.980> came<00:00:19.310> to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
wake-up call that these guys came to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.590 
wake-up call that these guys came to

be<00:00:28.490> what<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.789> early<00:00:29.000> eternally<00:00:29.420> thought

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
be what the early eternally thought

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.799 
be what the early eternally thought
tender<00:00:30.320> oh<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:31.250> thought<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.699> was<00:00:31.939> huge<00:00:32.330> okay

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
tender oh I thought that was huge okay

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.610 
tender oh I thought that was huge okay
they<00:00:33.440> go<00:00:33.620> down<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.100> score<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:36.350> know<00:00:36.440> now

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
they go down and score and you know now

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.930 
they go down and score and you know now
we<00:00:36.680> really<00:00:36.980> didn't<00:00:37.309> move<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.610> that<00:00:37.730> have<00:00:37.910> a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
we really didn't move to that have a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.299 
we really didn't move to that have a
pond<00:00:38.210> right<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.809> front<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.380> I<00:00:39.920> thought<00:00:40.250> that

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
pond right in front and I thought that

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.630 
pond right in front and I thought that
was<00:00:40.610> probably<00:00:41.590> I'd<00:00:42.590> say<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.040> turning<00:00:43.399> point

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
was probably I'd say the turning point

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.940 
was probably I'd say the turning point
in<00:00:43.790> so<00:00:44.120> early<00:00:44.149> right<00:00:44.930> but<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.170> got<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.469> momentum

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
in so early right but I got to momentum

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.770 
in so early right but I got to momentum
back<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:46.879> know<00:00:46.940> we<00:00:47.059> had<00:00:47.149> what<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.390> seven

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
back and you know we had what a seven

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.970 
back and you know we had what a seven
yard<00:00:48.010> short<00:00:49.010> field<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.000> then<00:00:50.539> from<00:00:50.780> there

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
yard short field and then from there

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.279 
yard short field and then from there
defense<00:00:52.059> took<00:00:53.059> over<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.600> office<00:00:54.050> before

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
defense took over in the office before

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.350 
defense took over in the office before

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.530 
happened but I think a cup of our
defensive<00:01:07.220> guys<00:01:07.399> they<00:01:07.729> really<00:01:08.030> went<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.360> there

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
defensive guys they really went in there

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.380 
defensive guys they really went in there
in<00:01:09.040> created<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:10.220> turnover<00:01:10.640> fought<00:01:11.090> for<00:01:11.360> a
