thought<00:00:01.589> it<00:00:01.709> would<00:00:01.829> take<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.040> minute<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.490> show

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
thought it would take a minute and show

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.260 
thought it would take a minute and show
you<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:02.970> setup<00:00:03.270> here<00:00:04.670> I've<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.060> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
you this setup here I've got is a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.890 
you this setup here I've got is a
Arduino<00:00:07.200> 18<00:00:07.890> mega<00:00:08.130> hooked<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> special

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
Arduino 18 mega hooked up to a special

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410 
Arduino 18 mega hooked up to a special
little<00:00:10.519> criteria<00:00:11.519> jig<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.790> I've<00:00:12.030> made<00:00:12.210> here

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
little criteria jig that I've made here

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.939 
little criteria jig that I've made here
and<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.650> actually<00:00:13.799> communicating<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and it's actually communicating with the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
and it's actually communicating with the
computer<00:00:17.400> via<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.539> code<00:00:21.529> now<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> spawn<00:00:24.359> is

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
computer via this code now the spawn is

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:38.380 
computer via this code now the spawn is
operating<00:00:24.960> properly

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.660 

but<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.280> interesting<00:00:41.280> thing<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
but the interesting thing is that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.389 
but the interesting thing is that
there's<00:00:44.670> communication<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.809> here

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
there's communication going on here

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
there's communication going on here
right<00:00:47.399> before<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.239> primary<00:00:48.510> boot<00:00:48.930> loader

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
right before the primary boot loader

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.700 
right before the primary boot loader
loads<00:00:49.559> up

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.819 

and<00:00:59.730> if<00:01:00.730> you<00:01:00.940> look<00:01:00.969> here<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:02.050> got<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.350> primary

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
and if you look here you got the primary

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.380 
and if you look here you got the primary
boot<00:01:03.040> loader<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.610> primitive<00:01:04.000> boot<00:01:04.180> loader

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
boot loader the primitive boot loader

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.930 
boot loader the primitive boot loader
and<00:01:04.659> then<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.050> secondary<00:01:05.470> boot<00:01:05.710> loader<00:01:05.979> all

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
and then the secondary boot loader all

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.130 
and then the secondary boot loader all
right<00:01:07.210> now<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:09.460> going<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.700> access<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.360> SPL

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
right now we're going to access the SPL

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.270 
right now we're going to access the SPL
prompt<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.830> way<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:11.979> get<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.729> by

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
prompt and the way you get to that is by

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.120 
prompt and the way you get to that is by
putting<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.580> battery<00:01:15.909> while<00:01:16.860> holding<00:01:17.860> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
SPL prompt here let me make this a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
SPL prompt here let me make this a
little<00:01:23.830> bit<00:01:24.130> bigger<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:28.649> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
little bit bigger so you can see this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.850 
little bit bigger so you can see this
comes<00:01:31.479> after<00:01:31.750> all<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.350> other<00:01:32.590> information

available so what we're trying to do is
figure<00:02:30.370> out<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.670> way<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.720> get

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
figure out a way that we can get

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.090 
figure out a way that we can get
something<00:02:34.660> out<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.019> this<00:02:35.230> device<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:38.080> the

secondary and primary boot loaders both

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.320 
secondary and primary boot loaders both
inoperative<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.610> what<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> do<00:02:46.299> here

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
inoperative so what I'm going to do here

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.160 
inoperative so what I'm going to do here
is<00:02:46.720> I'm<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.170> brick<00:02:47.380> my<00:02:47.560> phone<00:02:48.750> well<00:02:49.750> soft

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
is I'm going to brick my phone well soft

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.370 
is I'm going to brick my phone well soft
brick<00:02:51.000> startup<00:02:52.000> handle<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.690> while<00:02:53.200> it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
brick startup handle and while it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.880 
brick startup handle and while it's
flashing<00:02:54.030> fold<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.269> motor<00:02:55.480> pull<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.470> cable

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
flashing fold the motor pull the cable

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.789 
flashing fold the motor pull the cable
out<00:02:58.980> and<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.570> should<00:03:02.019> have<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> pretty<00:03:02.739> good

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
out and now we should have a pretty good

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.750 
out and now we should have a pretty good
brick<00:03:04.079> soft<00:03:05.079> brick

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.570 

so<00:03:09.420> we'll<00:03:09.540> take<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:11.189> can<00:03:11.370> plug<00:03:11.549> that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
so we'll take that and we can plug that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:22.800 
so we'll take that and we can plug that
in<00:03:12.620> back<00:03:13.620> into<00:03:14.069> our<00:03:14.420> communication<00:03:15.420> device

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.180
