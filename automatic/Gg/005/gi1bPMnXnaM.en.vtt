00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the sugar starts to liquefy it's going

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.870 
the sugar starts to liquefy it's going
to<00:01:11.610> become<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.479> hot<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> butter

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to become very very hot as is the butter

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
to become very very hot as is the butter
so<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.630> important<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.350> stir

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so it's really important that you stir

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
so it's really important that you stir
it<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:16.830> carefully<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.700> stir<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.030> too

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
it very carefully don't stir it too
vigorously<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.860> sugar<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
vigorously you don't want the sugar to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.940 
vigorously you don't want the sugar to
splash<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> land<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.350> hands

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
because it will burn very very badly

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
because it will burn very very badly
also<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.040> important<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> keep<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> mind

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
also really important to keep in mind

that the handle of your pan is gonna
start<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.520> hot<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> could<00:01:31.290> even<00:01:31.439> see

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
start to get hot and you could even see

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
start to get hot and you could even see
around<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> rim<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> pan<00:01:32.790> I'm<00:01:33.030> starting

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
around the rim of the pan I'm starting

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.880 
around the rim of the pan I'm starting
to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> sugar<00:01:33.990> starting<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> caramelize

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to get the sugar starting to caramelize

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
to get the sugar starting to caramelize
already<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.060> sugar<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.780> melt<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
already and sugar is gonna melt at a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
already and sugar is gonna melt at a
very<00:01:37.530> high<00:01:37.680> temperature<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.430> we're

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
very high temperature and then we're

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
very high temperature and then we're
gonna<00:01:38.670> continue<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.210> cook<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:40.049> about

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
gonna continue to cook it to about about

gonna continue to cook it to about about
320<00:01:41.700> degrees<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.659> course<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.200> 320<00:01:43.979> degrees

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
320 degrees and of course at 320 degrees

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
320 degrees and of course at 320 degrees
it's<00:01:44.549> gonna<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:45.090> hot<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.869> really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it's gonna be very hot so it's really

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
one made out of silicone so it can

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
one made out of silicone so it can
withstand<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.220> temperature<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.850> regular

regular<00:01:56.729> wooden<00:01:56.969> spoon<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:58.619> your<00:01:58.799> best

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
regular wooden spoon is not your best

choice<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.759> better<00:01:59.909> off<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
choice you would be better off to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.149 
choice you would be better off to
actually<00:02:00.630> use<00:02:00.810> something<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159

coming<00:02:18.680> from<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.249> pan<00:02:19.489> that's<00:02:19.790> fine<00:02:20.180> that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
coming from the pan that's fine that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.050 
coming from the pan that's fine that
tells<00:02:20.719> you<00:02:20.840> exactly<00:02:20.989> how<00:02:21.409> hot<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.519> find

that<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.299> cream<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.569> going<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.959> be<00:02:24.049> better

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that the cream is going to be better

goes<00:02:26.359> into<00:02:26.719> the<00:02:26.810> pan<00:02:27.019> that's<00:02:27.170> gonna<00:02:27.379> bubble

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
and anticipate that and it may even lump

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.629 
and anticipate that and it may even lump
up<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.629> bit<00:02:35.810> which<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.680> absolutely<00:02:37.310> fine

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
up a little bit which is absolutely fine

up a little bit which is absolutely fine
you<00:02:38.000> want<00:02:38.719> to<00:02:38.780> watch<00:02:38.900> out<00:02:39.109> for<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.409> steam<00:02:39.739> to

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.069 
notice that I poured the cream and then
pulled<00:02:42.200> my<00:02:42.319> hand<00:02:42.590> away<00:02:43.150> let<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.329> continue<00:02:44.659> to

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
pulled my hand away let this continue to

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.619 
pulled my hand away let this continue to
basically<00:02:45.950> cool<00:02:46.280> off<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.519> little<00:02:46.669> bit<00:02:46.879> if<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
basically cool off a little bit if the

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.000 
basically cool off a little bit if the
sugar<00:02:47.870> won't<00:02:48.139> end<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.290> getting<00:02:48.590> really<00:02:48.709> lumpy

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
sugar won't end up getting really lumpy
