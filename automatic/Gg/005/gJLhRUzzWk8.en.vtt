00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
I've got here in this tank right now is

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
I've got here in this tank right now is
a<00:01:37.400> magnetic<00:01:38.400> blue<00:01:39.360> light<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a magnetic blue light I don't know if I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.539 
a magnetic blue light I don't know if I
said<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.189> wrap<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.299> yeah<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.960> basically

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
said that wrap but yeah it's basically

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.179 
said that wrap but yeah it's basically
what<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.049> saltwater<00:01:46.049> tanks<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
what they use in saltwater tanks so it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.840 
what they use in saltwater tanks so it
helps<00:01:47.610> certain<00:01:47.909> type<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:50.540> coral<00:01:51.540> grow<00:01:51.780> um<00:01:52.850> but

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
helps certain type of coral grow um but

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.800 
helps certain type of coral grow um but
yeah<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.210> uh<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.420> blue<00:01:57.630> light

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
yeah it's uh it's it's the blue light

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
yeah it's uh it's it's the blue light
you<00:01:57.840> want<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> make<00:01:58.229> sure<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> blue

light um you know a lot of the pre-made

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.730 
light um you know a lot of the pre-made
uh<00:02:02.630> kits<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.380> pre-made<00:02:06.409> glofish<00:02:07.409> kits

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
uh kits the pre-made glofish kits

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
uh kits the pre-made glofish kits
they'll<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> LEDs<00:02:08.879> or<00:02:09.030> something<00:02:09.270> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
they'll have like LEDs or something like

that<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.110> need<00:02:10.470> LEDs<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that you don't need LEDs this is a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400 
that you don't need LEDs this is a
fluorescent<00:02:12.300> light<00:02:12.450> bulb

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
fluorescent light bulb

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
fluorescent light bulb
what<00:02:13.680> matters<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.340> color<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.810> you

what matters is the color you know you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.580 
what matters is the color you know you
want<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> blue<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:17.010> blue<00:02:17.490> light<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.350> yeah

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
want to get a blue a blue light so yeah

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
want to get a blue a blue light so yeah
that's<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.550> I've<00:02:20.640> gotten<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.180> just

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that's what I've gotten here just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.090 
that's what I've gotten here just
basically<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.900> blue<00:02:22.320> light<00:02:22.620> pick<00:02:23.430> netic<00:02:25.100> this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
basically a blue light pick netic this

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.940 
basically a blue light pick netic this
one's<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.990> t8<00:02:29.150> 18<00:02:30.150> inches<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.780> length<00:02:31.380> t8<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
one's a t8 18 inches the length t8 is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.250 
one's a t8 18 inches the length t8 is
the<00:02:32.460> diameter<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.500> yeah<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.100> uh<00:02:36.260> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the diameter of it so yeah it's uh this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.290 
the diameter of it so yeah it's uh this
is<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> light<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.740> used<00:02:37.860> um<00:02:40.490> now<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.850> bought<00:02:42.240> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
is the light I used um now I bought a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
is the light I used um now I bought a
different<00:02:42.870> light<00:02:43.020> not<00:02:43.260> too<00:02:43.410> long<00:02:43.560> ago

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
different light not too long ago

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.270 
different light not too long ago
this<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.300> an<00:02:45.450> aqua<00:02:45.780> blue<00:02:45.810> light<00:02:46.350> you're

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
this one is an aqua blue light you're

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
this one is an aqua blue light you're
going<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.550> want<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> avoid<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.080> says

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
going to want to avoid this one it says

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.620 
going to want to avoid this one it says
glow<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.520> think<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.970> basically

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
glow on it but I think that's basically

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.020 
glow on it but I think that's basically
false<00:02:52.020> advertising<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.460> know<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.610> says<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
false advertising you know it says the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.570 
false advertising you know it says the
ideal<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.690> first<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.350> says<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.190> K

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
ideal so first of all it says that the K

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.210 
ideal so first of all it says that the K
value<00:02:59.940> is<00:02:59.970> 18,000<00:03:00.750> K<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.620> basically<00:03:02.070> in

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
value is 18,000 K which is basically in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.800 
value is 18,000 K which is basically in
the<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.790> kind<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.210> in<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> blue<00:03:03.600> range

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
the you know kind of in the blue range

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.130 
the you know kind of in the blue range
and<00:03:04.140> then<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.800> says<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.460> ideal<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.420> planet

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and then it says it's ideal for planet

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.590 
and then it says it's ideal for planet
aquariums<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.790> doesn't<00:03:09.090> make<00:03:09.210> any<00:03:09.390> sense

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
aquariums that doesn't make any sense

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.960 
aquariums that doesn't make any sense
first<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.170> all<00:03:10.350> because<00:03:10.710> planted<00:03:11.490> aquariums

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
first of all because planted aquariums

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.890 
first of all because planted aquariums
need<00:03:12.150> about<00:03:12.980> 6,000<00:03:13.980> K<00:03:14.130> for<00:03:15.060> their<00:03:15.180> lights<00:03:15.420> but

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
need about 6,000 K for their lights but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.960 
need about 6,000 K for their lights but
that<00:03:16.050> that's<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> light<00:03:16.680> color<00:03:16.980> by<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.820> way

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
that that's the light color by the way

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.470 
that that's the light color by the way
the<00:03:18.209> K<00:03:18.390> value<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:20.430> can't<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.820> right<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the K value so that can't be right and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.830 
the K value so that can't be right and
then<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.990> put<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.830> put<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:24.209> put

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
then I put it on I put the the I put

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.949 
then I put it on I put the the I put
this<00:03:25.080> light<00:03:25.440> inside<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> aquarium<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.540> it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
this light inside the aquarium and it it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.380 
this light inside the aquarium and it it
did<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.320> make<00:03:28.470> anything<00:03:28.830> blow<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:30.209> was

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
did not make anything blow it was

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.050 
did not make anything blow it was
basically<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.990> like<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.170> regular<00:03:31.470> average<00:03:32.310> Jo

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
basically just like a regular average Jo

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.390 
basically just like a regular average Jo
light<00:03:33.390> bulb<00:03:33.690> maybe<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.620> little<00:03:34.890> bit<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
light bulb maybe a little bit on the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.940 
light bulb maybe a little bit on the
blue<00:03:35.640> side<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.270> see<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.200> this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
blue side but you see this this is this

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400 
blue side but you see this this is this
is<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.400> spectrum<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.270> lighting<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.990> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
is the spectrum of the lighting and I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.590 
is the spectrum of the lighting and I
don't<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.270> kind<00:03:42.540> of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
don't know I just think it's kind of

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.710 
don't know I just think it's kind of
misleading<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.380> uh<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.550> says<00:03:45.090> yeah<00:03:45.450> that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
misleading it uh it says yeah that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.020 
misleading it uh it says yeah that
there's<00:03:45.959> there's<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.950> little<00:03:47.310> bit<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> blue

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
there's there's a little bit in the blue

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.830 
there's there's a little bit in the blue
range<00:03:48.360> but<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:50.070> really<00:03:50.640> did<00:03:51.000> not<00:03:51.150> show<00:03:51.480> at<00:03:51.690> all

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
range but it really did not show at all

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.260 
range but it really did not show at all
into<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.560> aquarium<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.130> really<00:03:53.489> mostly<00:03:53.880> in

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
into that aquarium it's really mostly in

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.790 
into that aquarium it's really mostly in
the<00:03:55.110> red<00:03:55.260> range<00:03:55.770> here<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.470> look<00:03:58.680> at

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
the red range here and if you look at

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.320 
the red range here and if you look at
this<00:03:58.980> one<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> one<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.090> do

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
this one this is the one that you do

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.810 
this one this is the one that you do
want<00:04:00.709> for<00:04:02.540> for<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:04.140> glow<00:04:04.470> fish<00:04:04.680> tank<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.250> if<00:04:05.700> you

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
want for for a glow fish tank and if you

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.410 
want for for a glow fish tank and if you
look<00:04:06.000> at<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.660> Peaks<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.550> blue<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.239> then

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
look at it it Peaks in the blue and then

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.140 
look at it it Peaks in the blue and then
there's<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.660> lot<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.350> there's<00:04:10.950> not<00:04:11.340> no

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
there's a lot of it and there's not no

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.920 
there's a lot of it and there's not no
red<00:04:12.360> whatsoever<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.690> yeah<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.870> is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
red whatsoever and so yeah this is

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.720 
red whatsoever and so yeah this is
definitely<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.739> light<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.250> need<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
definitely the light that you need and

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.409 
definitely the light that you need and
so<00:04:18.540> once<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.020> get<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> light<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.859> fish

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
so once you get the light in the fish

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.529 
so once you get the light in the fish
and<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.719> rest<00:04:21.019> is<00:04:21.319> just<00:04:21.349> basically<00:04:22.300> it's<00:04:23.300> not

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
and the rest is just basically it's not

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.189 
and the rest is just basically it's not
