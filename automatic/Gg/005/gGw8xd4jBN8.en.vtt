and<00:00:07.710> after<00:00:08.639> springing<00:00:09.480> cards<00:00:09.900> we're<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and after springing cards we're going to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.839 
and after springing cards we're going to
cover<00:00:11.450> llop<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.660> spread<00:00:13.110> i<00:00:13.170> believe<00:00:13.849> that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
cover llop all spread i believe that

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150 
cover llop all spread i believe that
seems<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.450> make<00:00:15.570> sense<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.800> after<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
seems to make sense and then after the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.439 
seems to make sense and then after the
lapel<00:00:17.460> spread<00:00:17.730> i<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:18.029> i<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.240> start

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
lapel spread i think i will start

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.769 
lapel spread i think i will start
talking<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.869> one-handed<00:00:19.350> cuts<00:00:20.000> um<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
talking about one-handed cuts um the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
talking about one-handed cuts um the
loop<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.199> spread<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.769> very<00:00:22.980> fancy<00:00:23.400> way<00:00:23.519> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
loop all spread is very fancy way to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.830 
loop all spread is very fancy way to
spread<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> cards<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.420> never<00:00:24.660> been

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
spread the cards I've never been

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.050 
spread the cards I've never been
particularly<00:00:25.289> good<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.609> he<00:00:26.760> winds<00:00:27.000> up

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
particularly good at it but he winds up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
particularly good at it but he winds up
looking<00:00:27.180> something<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.109> oh<00:00:28.380> excuse<00:00:29.369> me

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that's not very good at all why is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.799 
that's not very good at all why is
looking<00:00:31.260> something<00:00:32.450> something<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
looking something something like that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
looking something something like that

that modified mechanic's grip and then

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
that modified mechanic's grip and then
you're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> shift<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> deck<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you're going to shift the deck so that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
you're going to shift the deck so that
there's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> gap<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:28.560> in

there's a little bit of a gap right in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.940 
there's a little bit of a gap right in
here<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> again<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> bow

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
here and then again you're going to bow

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
there's probably one on penguin and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.789 
there's probably one on penguin and
there<00:02:48.849> might<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.090> clip<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.660> there<00:02:49.840> but

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
there might be a clip of it in there but

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.100 
there might be a clip of it in there but
yeah<00:02:50.860> that's<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.280> loop<00:02:51.370> all<00:02:51.549> spread<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.870> just

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
yeah that's the loop all spread so just

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.110 
yeah that's the loop all spread so just
to<00:02:53.200> recap<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:54.250> want<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> little<00:02:54.640> gap<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.000> here
