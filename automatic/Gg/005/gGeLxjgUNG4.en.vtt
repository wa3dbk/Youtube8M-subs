00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:07.903
 Imagine, day after day, 

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.700
 Shrink your field of vision, 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.528
 Or narrow or become dark 

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:16.162
 Until finally become blind completely. 

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:19.179
 We always believe that blindness is one thing that comes from birth, 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.003
 But in fact, many diseases such as retinitis pigmentary 

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.607
 Asher syndrome, 

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.275
 Allow blindness to increase if you are a child. 

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.415
 Or even if you are an adult. 

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:33.247
 Both of these rare genetic diseases affect the retina, 

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:38.390
 It is the screen at the back of the eye that detects light and helps us to see. 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.705
 Imagine if the eye can renew itself 

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.630
 This will enable the blind person to see again. 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.827
 To understand if possible, we need to understand how the retina works 

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:52.526
 And what its function in the creature of multi-potential 

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:55.168
 Called (Zebra fish). 

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.893
 The human retina consists of different layers of cells, 

00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:01.302
 In addition to the special neurons located in the back of the eye 

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:05.031
 Called light receptors. 

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.020
 Light receptors turn light coming to your eye 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.042
 To signals used by the brain in the formation of vision. 

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:15.381
 People with AS and retinitis pigmentosa 

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.987
 They have weak photoreceptors 

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:23.351
 The weakness continues until the eye network is finally unable to receive light 

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.245
 Or transmitting signals to the brain. 

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:30.705
 Optical receptors are not like other cells in the body, they do not divide or multiply. 

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:34.820
 Our son and we have photovoltaic receptors that we will complete all our lives, 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.909
 For this reason, babies have wide eyes. 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.217
 Make them beautiful. 

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.629
 But this is not the case for all animals. 

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:46.606
 (Zebra) is a perfect model for the renovation process. 

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:52.524
 Her skin, bones, heart and retina can grow again if exposed to damage. 

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:57.438
 If the photoreceptors are removed or killed in the retina of the Zebra eye, 

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:03.032
 These damaged organs renew themselves and send signals to the brain to restore vision. 

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.670
 Scientists have realized this great ability 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.643
 Because the installation of the net Zebra eye is very similar to the composition of the retina of the human eye. 

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:14.796
 Scientists can observe the effects of disorders such as Achar syndrome 

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:18.502
 Or pigmentary retinitis on the eyes of the Zebra. 

00:02:18.502 --> 00:02:22.758
 This allows them to see how the Zebra is repairing the retina 

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:26.757
 This may enable them to use similar methods to repair the human eye someday. 

00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:29.622
 What is the great power of Zebra? 

00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:34.617
 The primary cause is groups of long cells that extend across the retina 

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:35.752
 (Called Muller Galia). 

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:40.094
 When the receiving cells become damaged, light turns 

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:41.997
 To take a new shape. 

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:45.684
 And become less like Moeller cells, and more similar stem cells, 

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:48.049
 Which can transform into any cell type. 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.090
 These cells are then divided into long, 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.284
 To produce more of them to grow in the end and become new receptor cells of light, 

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:57.752
 Then move to the back of the eye and reconnect itself to the brain. 

00:02:57.752 --> 00:03:02.131
 Some researchers now believe they have found how these cells work 

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:06.163
 With the help of one of the two chemicals that cause activity in the brain 

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:08.917
 Called glutamate and aminodipate. 

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.382
 In mice's eyes, 

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:14.433
 These chemicals make Moeller cells divide and then turn into photoreceptor cells. 

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.813
 Which in turn moves to the end of the retina, 

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:19.996
 As if they are replacing all old cells with new ones. 

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:24.261
 But remember, all this has not happened in our retinas so far, 

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:28.346
 So the question is how we can use this transformation for Muller cells 

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.538
 In the human eye? 

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:32.420
 How can we fully control this process? 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.083
 How will the receiving cells renew and connect themselves to the retina? 

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.784
 Is this applicable to humans? 

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:42.338
 Or that this mechanism may be lost with evolution over time? 

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:45.680
 The ability to regenerate the retina will remain a mystery 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.509
 So we understand the origin of the way it works. 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.312
 In the Zebra.
