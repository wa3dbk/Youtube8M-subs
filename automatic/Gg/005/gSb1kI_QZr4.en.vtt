00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
course the cream so first off let's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
course the cream so first off let's
start<00:00:52.230> heating<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> milk<00:00:53.010> over<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.860> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
start heating the milk over here and we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
start heating the milk over here and we
just<00:00:56.879> separate<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> eggs<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.440> think

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just separate out the eggs now I think

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
just separate out the eggs now I think
if<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.190> sensible<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> clever<00:01:00.480> what<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
if you're sensible and clever what you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.640 
if you're sensible and clever what you
do<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.710> always<00:01:02.270> separate<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
do is you always separate them into a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.460 
do is you always separate them into a
ramekin<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.080> want<00:01:07.260> any

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
ramekin first because you don't want any

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.520 
ramekin first because you don't want any
trace<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.580> egg<00:01:08.790> yolk<00:01:09.060> there's<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.200> egg

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
every now and then so that it retains

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.409
