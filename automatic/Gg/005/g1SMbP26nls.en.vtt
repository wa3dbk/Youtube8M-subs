00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
right thanks some good advice that I had

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.249 
right thanks some good advice that I had
on<00:00:04.910> vortex<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> get<00:00:06.390> an<00:00:06.480> e<00:00:06.660> GT<00:00:06.870> gauge

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
on vortex I'm going to get an e GT gauge

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.730 
on vortex I'm going to get an e GT gauge
on<00:00:07.470> it

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
on it

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530 
on it
it's<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.280> boost<00:00:08.490> gauge<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.389> one

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
it's my boost gauge here it's up at one

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.030 
it's my boost gauge here it's up at one
pound<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.139> pretty<00:00:10.349> reliable<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.980> a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
pound but it's pretty reliable it's a

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.629 
pound but it's pretty reliable it's a
video<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.110> over<00:00:13.950> fueling<00:00:14.370> or<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:14.580> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
video this is the over fueling or what I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.519 
video this is the over fueling or what I
think<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.880> over<00:00:15.000> fueling<00:00:15.420> idling<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.320> about

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
think is over fueling idling in about

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
think is over fueling idling in about
1100<00:00:17.279> instead<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> usual<00:00:17.910> nine<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
1100 instead of the usual nine to a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560 
1100 instead of the usual nine to a
thousand<00:00:19.490> fuel<00:00:20.490> screws<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.330> but

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
thousand fuel screws all the way in but

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.420 
thousand fuel screws all the way in but
I<00:00:21.630> can't<00:00:21.930> use<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> other<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.949> screws<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I can't use the other two screws in the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.790 
I can't use the other two screws in the
fuel<00:00:23.609> pump<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.269> try<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.720> adjust<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.529> slow

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
fuel pump to try and adjust it and slow

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.419 
fuel pump to try and adjust it and slow
it<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> actually<00:00:26.730> won't<00:00:27.090> slow<00:00:27.449> down

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
it down but it actually won't slow down

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.800 
it down but it actually won't slow down
yes<00:00:29.429> oh<00:00:29.550> thanks<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.849> great<00:00:30.029> advice<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.660> going

and their filter involve lines found
some<00:01:20.880> fuel<00:01:21.149> lines<00:01:21.570> which<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.649> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> take

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
some fuel lines which I'm going to take

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
some fuel lines which I'm going to take
out<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.000> put<00:01:24.299> new<00:01:24.450> ones<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
out and put new ones in because as you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
out and put new ones in because as you
can<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:26.399> let<00:01:26.610> air<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:28.940> with<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.259> I've

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
can see they let air in with that I've

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.700 
can see they let air in with that I've
got<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.880> fuel<00:01:33.750> screw<00:01:34.250> down<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.380> any

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
got the fuel screw down here just it any

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.809 
got the fuel screw down here just it any
other<00:01:37.860> screws<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:39.270> I've<00:01:39.509> worked<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.819> if

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
other screws which I've worked are if

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.770 
other screws which I've worked are if
you<00:01:42.149> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.289> these<00:01:44.009> two

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.480 

yes<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.319> think<00:01:49.530> maybe<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.009> could<00:01:50.220> try<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
yes so I think maybe I could try and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
yes so I think maybe I could try and
slow<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.789> down<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.179> bit<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.810> car<00:01:52.020> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
slow it down that a bit the car in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.639 
slow it down that a bit the car in

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
squid he's got a custom exhaust and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.500 
squid he's got a custom exhaust and
asked<00:04:05.100> him<00:04:05.190> where<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.400> came<00:04:05.610> from<00:04:05.670> I've<00:04:06.269> just

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
asked him where I came from I've just

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.720 
asked him where I came from I've just
got<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> stock<00:04:07.049> exhaust<00:04:07.230> down<00:04:07.799> there<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.370> I

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
got the stock exhaust down there but I

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.420 
got the stock exhaust down there but I
was<00:04:09.239> thinking<00:04:09.480> he<00:04:09.600> said<00:04:09.810> he<00:04:09.870> had<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> 2.5<00:04:10.709> inch

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
was thinking he said he had a 2.5 inch

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.870 
was thinking he said he had a 2.5 inch
thinking<00:04:12.390> about<00:04:12.540> maybe<00:04:12.720> doing<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:14.519> well

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
thinking about maybe doing that as well

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.300 
thinking about maybe doing that as well
so<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:15.840> not<00:04:15.959> sure<00:04:16.019> whether<00:04:16.350> my<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.739> should<00:04:17.190> go

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
so I'm not sure whether my I should go

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.349 
so I'm not sure whether my I should go
for<00:04:17.549> next<00:04:19.370> considering<00:04:20.370> things<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.209> want

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
for next considering things like I want

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.330 
for next considering things like I want
to<00:04:21.510> get<00:04:21.630> more<00:04:21.840> power<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.410> more<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.950> miles<00:04:23.160> to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
to get more power and more more miles to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.760 
to get more power and more more miles to
the<00:04:23.370> gallon<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.240> one<00:04:24.600> or<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> other<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.620> about

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the gallon and one or the other to about

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.810 
the gallon and one or the other to about
200<00:04:26.130> K<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.490> day<00:04:26.729> so<00:04:27.919> really<00:04:28.919> I'm<00:04:29.250> tuning<00:04:29.700> it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
200 K is a day so really I'm tuning it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120 
200 K is a day so really I'm tuning it
for<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:31.110> kind<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.350> performance<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.830> live<00:04:31.979> in<00:04:32.070> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
for that kind of performance I live in a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.159 
for that kind of performance I live in a
climate<00:04:32.310> where<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.880> never<00:04:33.030> gets<00:04:33.300> below<00:04:33.540> 5

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
climate where it never gets below 5

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.670 
climate where it never gets below 5
degrees<00:04:34.200> Celsius<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.630> yeah<00:04:36.630> any<00:04:36.960> suggestions

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
degrees Celsius so yeah any suggestions

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.550 
degrees Celsius so yeah any suggestions
some<00:04:38.720> suggestions<00:04:39.720> would<00:04:39.870> be<00:04:39.930> great<00:04:40.229> I'd<00:04:40.410> love

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
some suggestions would be great I'd love

some suggestions would be great I'd love
to<00:04:40.650> get<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.770> pump<00:04:41.100> tuned<00:04:41.580> modules<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.510> regime

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
to get the pump tuned modules but regime

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.159 
to get the pump tuned modules but regime
as<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:43.890> sound<00:04:44.070> finish<00:04:44.430> but<00:04:45.030> that's<00:04:45.240> about<00:04:45.660> 900

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
as we sound finish but that's about 900

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.750 
as we sound finish but that's about 900
bucks<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.530> can't<00:04:46.740> afford<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.340> at<00:04:47.640> the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
bucks and I can't afford that at the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.620 
bucks and I can't afford that at the
moment<00:04:50.660> mm-hmm<00:04:52.250> what<00:04:53.250> else<00:04:53.540> there<00:04:54.540> was

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
moment mm-hmm what else there was

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.360 
moment mm-hmm what else there was
something<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.050> do<00:04:55.200> with<00:04:55.320> putting<00:04:55.590> 12<00:04:55.950> volts

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
something to do with putting 12 volts

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.820 
something to do with putting 12 volts
into<00:04:56.520> one<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.850> these<00:04:56.940> fuel<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.830> fuel

solenoids<00:04:59.070> I'm<00:04:59.640> not<00:04:59.940> sure<00:05:00.150> what<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:00.360> does

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
solenoids I'm not sure what that does

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.650 
solenoids I'm not sure what that does
and<00:05:01.740> unplug<00:05:02.740> one<00:05:03.130> or<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.370> plug<00:05:03.580> one<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:03.970> or

supply it with a constant 12 volts I
can't<00:05:07.300> remember<00:05:07.419> what<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.780> doesnõt<00:05:08.229> is

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
can't remember what that doesnõt is

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.290 
can't remember what that doesnõt is
thinking<00:05:09.310> about<00:05:09.400> that<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.940> think<00:05:10.150> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
thinking about that I think the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.550 
thinking about that I think the
intercooler<00:05:10.599> actually<00:05:10.990> was<00:05:11.080> really<00:05:11.259> really

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
intercooler actually was really really

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.710 
intercooler actually was really really
hard<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:11.979> was<00:05:12.039> a<00:05:12.099> really<00:05:12.370> hard<00:05:12.970> job<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.240> do<00:05:13.509> but

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
hard it was a really hard job to do but

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.990 
hard it was a really hard job to do but
I<00:05:14.229> didn't<00:05:14.710> notice<00:05:14.949> any<00:05:15.099> power<00:05:15.400> difference<00:05:15.819> but

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
I didn't notice any power difference but

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.230 
I didn't notice any power difference but
I<00:05:16.030> did<00:05:16.330> notice<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:17.770> mile<00:05:18.550> per<00:05:18.699> gallon<00:05:18.759> change

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
I did notice a mile per gallon change

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.820 
I did notice a mile per gallon change
not<00:05:19.419> supposed<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:19.930> lower<00:05:20.169> my<00:05:20.259> e<00:05:20.380> GTS

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
not supposed to just lower my e GTS

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.730 
not supposed to just lower my e GTS
anyways<00:05:22.380> because<00:05:23.380> the<00:05:25.020> EGR<00:05:26.020> delete<00:05:26.229> is

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
anyways because the EGR delete is

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.710 
anyways because the EGR delete is
supposed<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.039> raise<00:05:27.220> them<00:05:27.460> all<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:28.150> see<00:05:28.449> I'm

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
supposed to raise them all I see I'm

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.320 
supposed to raise them all I see I'm
running<00:05:29.169> about<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:30.180> reckon<00:05:31.180> it's<00:05:31.270> about

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
running about I reckon it's about

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.570 
running about I reckon it's about
thirteen<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.930> fourteen<00:05:32.080> pounds<00:05:32.560> off<00:05:32.949> the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
thirteen to fourteen pounds off the

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.399 
thirteen to fourteen pounds off the
turbos<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.300> it's<00:05:34.630> going<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.960> be<00:05:35.110> getting<00:05:35.349> a

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
turbos so it's going to be getting a

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.930 
turbos so it's going to be getting a
little<00:05:35.590> bit<00:05:35.680> hotter<00:05:35.889> in<00:05:36.099> there<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:36.759> going<00:05:36.849> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
little bit hotter in there it's going to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.710 
little bit hotter in there it's going to
get<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.180> get<00:05:37.870> that<00:05:37.900> gauge<00:05:38.259> on<00:05:38.590> stat<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:39.720> see

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
get that get that gauge on stat and see

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.969 
get that get that gauge on stat and see
what<00:05:40.840> my<00:05:40.930> temperatures<00:05:41.319> aren't<00:05:41.500> keeping<00:05:41.740> on

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
what my temperatures aren't keeping on

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.640 
what my temperatures aren't keeping on
them<00:05:42.310> but<00:05:42.789> any<00:05:43.000> suggestions<00:05:43.659> for<00:05:43.930> any<00:05:44.530> a

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
them but any suggestions for any a

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.839 
them but any suggestions for any a
general<00:05:45.069> improvements<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.610> mean<00:05:45.759> obviously

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
general improvements I mean obviously

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.010 
general improvements I mean obviously
I'm<00:05:46.120> going<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.270> change<00:05:46.449> these<00:05:46.569> lines<00:05:46.810> up

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
I'm going to change these lines up

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.570 
I'm going to change these lines up
because<00:05:47.199> they're<00:05:47.319> crap<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.830> thought<00:05:48.400> they'd<00:05:48.550> be

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
because they're crap I thought they'd be

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.080 
because they're crap I thought they'd be
good

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
good

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.059 
good
they're<00:05:49.360> from<00:05:49.630> marine<00:05:50.199> applications<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:50.979> they

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
they're from marine applications so they

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.649 
they're from marine applications so they
meant<00:05:51.250> for<00:05:51.400> vacuum<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:51.880> for<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> fuel<00:05:52.389> so

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
meant for vacuum and for a fuel so

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.010

things<00:05:58.780> like<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:59.080> usually<00:05:59.500> get<00:05:59.590> those<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.979> the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
things like I usually get those to the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.309 
things like I usually get those to the
injector<00:06:01.000> type<00:06:01.210> clamps<00:06:01.599> trying<00:06:01.930> to<00:06:02.020> stop<00:06:02.199> air

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
injector type clamps trying to stop air

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.420 
injector type clamps trying to stop air
from<00:06:02.500> going<00:06:02.710> in<00:06:02.830> yeah<00:06:03.009> onto<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:05.219> yeah<00:06:06.219> I've

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
from going in yeah onto that yeah I've

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.770 
from going in yeah onto that yeah I've
been<00:06:06.550> going<00:06:06.669> all<00:06:06.909> through<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.240> form<00:06:07.479> looking

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
been going all through the form looking

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.399 
been going all through the form looking
for<00:06:07.900> different<00:06:08.110> things

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
for different things

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.100 
for different things
I'll<00:06:08.740> put<00:06:08.919> synthetic<00:06:09.419> synthetic<00:06:10.419> oil<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:10.990> the

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
I'll put synthetic synthetic oil in the

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.870 
I'll put synthetic synthetic oil in the
transmission<00:06:11.710> it's<00:06:12.130> a<00:06:12.190> manual<00:06:12.460> obviously

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
transmission it's a manual obviously

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.159 
transmission it's a manual obviously
that<00:06:13.270> actually<00:06:13.479> made<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.599> difference<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:14.020> could

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
that actually made a difference I could

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.529 
that actually made a difference I could
feel<00:06:14.349> it<00:06:14.380> right<00:06:14.650> away<00:06:14.680> like<00:06:15.009> whoa<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.789> little

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
feel it right away like whoa a little

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.810 
feel it right away like whoa a little
bit<00:06:16.690> little<00:06:17.110> bit<00:06:17.229> more<00:06:17.500> power<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.460> little<00:06:18.729> bit

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
bit little bit more power a little bit

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.899 
bit little bit more power a little bit
smoother<00:06:19.120> shifting<00:06:19.449> so<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:19.900> did<00:06:20.229> that<00:06:20.610> I've<00:06:21.610> got

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
smoother shifting so I did that I've got

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.659 
smoother shifting so I did that I've got
a<00:06:21.940> whole<00:06:22.060> complete<00:06:23.050> parts<00:06:23.650> car<00:06:23.949> that<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.520> could

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
a whole complete parts car that I could

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.490 
a whole complete parts car that I could
take<00:06:24.820> parts<00:06:25.180> off<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.389> say<00:06:25.840> someone<00:06:26.229> said<00:06:26.380> all

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
take parts off of say someone said all

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.490 
take parts off of say someone said all
you<00:06:26.680> should<00:06:26.860> tune<00:06:27.759> import<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.330> intake<00:06:28.810> it'll

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
you should tune import the intake it'll

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.430 
you should tune import the intake it'll
make<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:29.620> difference<00:06:29.710> I<00:06:30.190> could<00:06:31.150> do<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.440> I've

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
make a difference I could do that I've

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.480 
make a difference I could do that I've
got<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.740> other<00:06:32.860> turbo<00:06:33.539> um<00:06:35.219> yeah

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
got the other turbo um yeah

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.779 
got the other turbo um yeah
open<00:06:36.789> suggestions<00:06:37.449> what<00:06:38.349> do<00:06:38.409> you<00:06:38.469> think<00:06:38.800> even

some<00:06:40.090> wacky<00:06:40.449> things<00:06:40.690> like<00:06:40.990> I've<00:06:41.500> heard<00:06:41.770> all

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
some wacky things like I've heard all

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.779 
some wacky things like I've heard all
you<00:06:42.250> can<00:06:42.370> take<00:06:42.580> take<00:06:43.449> this<00:06:43.599> oil<00:06:43.810> line<00:06:44.199> here<00:06:44.590> and

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
you can take take this oil line here and

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.999 
you can take take this oil line here and
make<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:45.819> go<00:06:46.139> round<00:06:47.139> and<00:06:47.409> round<00:06:47.590> for<00:06:47.860> like

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
make it go round and round for like

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.740 
make it go round and round for like
maybe<00:06:48.280> 20<00:06:48.639> feet<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.330> can<00:06:49.419> get<00:06:49.509> a<00:06:49.539> lot<00:06:49.719> more

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
maybe 20 feet and you can get a lot more

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.450 
maybe 20 feet and you can get a lot more
diesel<00:06:50.139> oil<00:06:50.469> in<00:06:50.710> and<00:06:50.860> it<00:06:50.949> keeps<00:06:51.130> it<00:06:51.250> fresh

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
diesel oil in and it keeps it fresh

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.850 
diesel oil in and it keeps it fresh
longer<00:06:51.669> better<00:06:52.509> mileage<00:06:52.750> that<00:06:53.080> way<00:06:53.229> I<00:06:53.409> don't

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
longer better mileage that way I don't

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.209 
longer better mileage that way I don't
know<00:06:54.069> I've<00:06:54.219> got<00:06:54.370> slightly<00:06:54.669> larger<00:06:55.889> mags<00:06:56.889> on<00:06:57.099> it

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
know I've got slightly larger mags on it

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.899 
know I've got slightly larger mags on it
it's<00:06:57.759> a<00:06:57.819> bit<00:06:57.940> of<00:06:58.000> a<00:06:58.060> hard<00:06:58.300> ride<00:06:58.539> to<00:06:58.750> be<00:06:58.870> honest

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
it's a bit of a hard ride to be honest

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.110 
it's a bit of a hard ride to be honest
but<00:07:00.909> it's<00:07:01.300> alright<00:07:02.310> there's<00:07:03.310> slightly<00:07:03.550> larger

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
but it's alright there's slightly larger

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.420 
but it's alright there's slightly larger
so<00:07:04.330> that<00:07:04.479> actually<00:07:04.990> helps<00:07:05.229> with<00:07:06.539> helps<00:07:07.539> with

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
so that actually helps with helps with

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.839 
so that actually helps with helps with
my<00:07:09.430> gearing<00:07:10.120> because<00:07:10.449> it<00:07:10.630> makes<00:07:10.810> it<00:07:10.960> so<00:07:11.740> that

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
my gearing because it makes it so that

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.329 
my gearing because it makes it so that
doing<00:07:12.849> less<00:07:13.029> revs<00:07:13.270> for<00:07:13.449> higher<00:07:13.630> speed

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:14.339 
doing less revs for higher speed

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:20.879 
doing less revs for higher speed
I've<00:07:15.339> got<00:07:15.809> cut<00:07:16.830> lots<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:18.099> power

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.609 

lots<00:07:21.699> of<00:07:21.849> power<00:07:22.029> when<00:07:22.360> I'm<00:07:22.479> rolling<00:07:22.629> on<00:07:22.990> on<00:07:23.379> the

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:23.619 
lots of power when I'm rolling on on the

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:27.689 
lots of power when I'm rolling on on the
highway<00:07:23.979> I<00:07:24.189> really<00:07:24.789> wouldn't<00:07:24.999> mind<00:07:25.059> say<00:07:26.699> even

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
highway I really wouldn't mind say even

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.850 
highway I really wouldn't mind say even
I<00:07:28.149> mean<00:07:28.569> putting<00:07:28.869> a<00:07:28.930> larger<00:07:29.349> tire<00:07:29.559> on<00:07:29.830> it

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
I mean putting a larger tire on it

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.769 
I mean putting a larger tire on it
wouldn't<00:07:30.219> that<00:07:30.669> wouldn't<00:07:30.819> bother<00:07:30.999> me<00:07:31.180> either

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:33.779

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:36.159 
yeah to try and get that get that down I

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
love to have a six-speed but I've no

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.589 
love to have a six-speed but I've no
idea<00:07:38.020> how<00:07:38.379> to<00:07:38.469> do<00:07:38.589> that<00:07:38.669> someone<00:07:39.669> I<00:07:39.909> bred<00:07:40.330> once

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
idea how to do that someone I bred once

on<00:07:40.779> VW<00:07:41.169> vortex<00:07:41.559> reading<00:07:41.919> around<00:07:42.039> that<00:07:42.369> you<00:07:42.490> can

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
on VW vortex reading around that you can

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.540 
on VW vortex reading around that you can
you<00:07:44.770> can<00:07:44.919> swap<00:07:45.219> the<00:07:45.369> fifth<00:07:45.639> gear<00:07:45.849> out<00:07:46.349> in<00:07:47.349> in<00:07:48.129> on

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
you can swap the fifth gear out in in on

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.579 
you can swap the fifth gear out in in on
the<00:07:48.669> tranny<00:07:49.110> something<00:07:50.110> I<00:07:50.229> don't<00:07:50.379> know<00:07:50.469> how

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:50.589 
the tranny something I don't know how

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:52.589 
the tranny something I don't know how
hard<00:07:50.889> or<00:07:51.069> easy<00:07:51.219> it<00:07:51.430> is<00:07:51.520> but<00:07:51.759> I<00:07:51.999> think<00:07:52.389> you<00:07:52.449> can

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 
hard or easy it is but I think you can

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:54.239 
hard or easy it is but I think you can
get<00:07:52.839> in<00:07:52.959> from<00:07:53.199> the<00:07:53.229> side<00:07:53.559> here<00:07:53.830> from<00:07:54.009> the<00:07:54.069> side

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:54.249 
get in from the side here from the side
