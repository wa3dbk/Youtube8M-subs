unless<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.090> course<00:01:06.119> you're<00:01:06.390> using<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.780> full

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
unless of course you're using a full

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.380 
unless of course you're using a full
auto<00:01:07.170> pistol<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.009> g18<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:09.060> yeah<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
auto pistol like the g18 but yeah if you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.910 
auto pistol like the g18 but yeah if you
play<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> these<00:01:10.080> service<00:01:10.500> tried<00:01:10.800> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
play on one of these service tried to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
play on one of these service tried to
make<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.190> conscious<00:01:11.400> decision<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> always

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
make the conscious decision to always

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
make the conscious decision to always
aim<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> head<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.410> really<00:01:13.440> notice<00:01:13.800> how

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
aim for the head you really notice how

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
aim for the head you really notice how
much<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> difference<00:01:14.910> it<00:01:15.060> makes<00:01:15.090> instead<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
much a difference it makes instead of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
much a difference it makes instead of
just<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> torso<00:01:16.649> which<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
just going for the torso which is the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
just going for the torso which is the
biggest<00:01:17.670> mass<00:01:17.940> target<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> an<00:01:18.630> opponent

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
biggest mass target of an opponent

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
biggest mass target of an opponent
naturally<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.550> play<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> train

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
naturally the more you play and train

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.790 
naturally the more you play and train
yourself<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.690> do<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.410> quicker<00:01:22.590> you'll

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
yourself to do this the quicker you'll

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.010 
yourself to do this the quicker you'll
drop<00:01:22.979> opponents<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.729> any<00:01:24.030> game<00:01:24.330> mode<00:01:24.539> not<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
drop opponents in any game mode not just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
drop opponents in any game mode not just
pistols<00:01:25.440> only<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.820> easy<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
pistols only I think it's really easy to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.820 
pistols only I think it's really easy to
get<00:01:27.660> into<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> habit<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.350> shooting

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
get into the habit of just shooting

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.529 
get into the habit of just shooting
quickly<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> target<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.940> soon<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.330> see

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
quickly at a target as soon as you see

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:31.999 
quickly at a target as soon as you see
them<00:01:30.780> without<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.259> thinking<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.740> where

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
them without really thinking about where

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.080 
them without really thinking about where
your<00:01:32.160> shots<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.940> most

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
your shots are going to do the most

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
your shots are going to do the most
damage<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.080> lot<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> players<00:01:34.500> fall<00:01:34.830> into

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
damage and a lot of players fall into

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.529 
damage and a lot of players fall into
this<00:01:35.220> pan<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.149> trying<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
this pan but just trying that

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.719 
this pan but just trying that
split-second<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.440> think<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.160> shoot<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
split-second to think and then shoot and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
split-second to think and then shoot and
it<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:38.970> make<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.149> big<00:01:39.450> difference<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.110> lot

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it will make a big difference in a lot

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
it will make a big difference in a lot
of<00:01:40.289> 1v1<00:01:40.679> gunfights<00:01:41.340> whilst<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.179> loading

bit<00:01:47.130> slower<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.330> think<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.900> more

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
bit slower and just think a little more

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
bit slower and just think a little more
before<00:01:49.200> pulling<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> trigger<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
before pulling the trigger the more you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
before pulling the trigger the more you
do<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.630> it'll<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> natural

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
do that the more it'll be like a natural

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.920 
do that the more it'll be like a natural
automatic<00:01:53.310> thing<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.820> it'll<00:01:54.540> improve<00:01:54.840> your

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
there's a conquest map I think it's a

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.509 
there's a conquest map I think it's a
great<00:02:16.140> rush<00:02:16.500> map<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.070> was<00:02:17.190> obviously

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
great rush map and it was obviously

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.100 
great rush map and it was obviously
designed<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:18.209> Russia<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.630> mind<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
designed with Russia in mind as the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.780 
designed with Russia in mind as the
primary<00:02:19.380> game<00:02:19.799> mode<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.579> it's<00:02:20.730> very

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
primary game mode you know it's very

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.240 
primary game mode you know it's very
progressive<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.810> linear<00:02:22.230> oh<00:02:22.530> man<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.070> think

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
progressive and linear oh man I think

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
progressive and linear oh man I think

not<00:05:03.150> enough<00:05:03.449> time<00:05:03.659> for<00:05:03.840> them<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:05.070> AC

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
not enough time for them to do it the AC

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.010 
not enough time for them to do it the AC
doesn't<00:05:05.639> work<00:05:05.909> very<00:05:05.940> well<00:05:06.270> at<00:05:06.450> all<00:05:06.479> in<00:05:06.779> rust

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
doesn't work very well at all in rust

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.719 
doesn't work very well at all in rust
and<00:05:07.260> there's<00:05:07.380> no<00:05:07.469> custom<00:05:07.919> antiquey<00:05:08.460> for<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
and there's no custom antiquey for the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.290 
and there's no custom antiquey for the
game<00:05:08.909> yet

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
game yet

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.839 
game yet
so<00:05:09.449> it's<00:05:10.110> very<00:05:10.349> easy<00:05:10.500> basically<00:05:11.310> for<00:05:11.580> someone

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
so it's very easy basically for someone

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.909 
so it's very easy basically for someone
to<00:05:12.030> download<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.690> hack<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.259> join<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.710> server

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
to download a hack and join the server

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.409 
to download a hack and join the server
and<00:05:14.069> just<00:05:14.250> fuck<00:05:14.400> everyone's<00:05:14.789> day<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.150> which

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
and just fuck everyone's day up which

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.399 
and just fuck everyone's day up which
isn't<00:05:15.840> good

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
isn't good

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.409 
isn't good
as<00:05:16.740> such<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.460> decided<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:17.940> make<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.180> server

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
as such we decided to make the server

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.939 
as such we decided to make the server
whitelist<00:05:18.930> only<00:05:19.349> and<00:05:19.590> you've<00:05:19.800> probably

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
whitelist only and you've probably

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.350 
whitelist only and you've probably
noticed<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.580> you<00:05:20.669> tried<00:05:20.879> to<00:05:20.970> connect<00:05:21.240> to
