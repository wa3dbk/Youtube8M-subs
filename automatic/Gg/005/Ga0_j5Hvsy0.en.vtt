00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
think as well when you're leveling out
lean<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.740> slightly<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> show<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
lean back slightly so you show you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
lean back slightly so you show you
weights<00:01:09.030> always<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.810> bike

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
weights always at the back of your bike

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
weights always at the back of your bike
rather<00:01:10.260> than<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> handlebars<00:01:11.549> I'll

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
rather than over the handlebars I'll

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
rather than over the handlebars I'll
show<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:19.520> went<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
confident for definite and then I'd say

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.340 
confident for definite and then I'd say
level<00:01:57.090> make<00:01:57.329> sure<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.630> level<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:58.020> that's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
level make sure you level out that's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.870 
level make sure you level out that's
like<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.649> main<00:01:58.829> problem<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.369> leveling<00:01:59.759> out

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
like your main problem is leveling out

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
like your main problem is leveling out

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619

at a lot of people's problems you better

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.720 
at a lot of people's problems you better
off<00:03:27.690> leaning<00:03:28.200> back<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.160> front<00:03:29.370> ends<00:03:29.580> in
