00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Vahrushev Ivan again 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 and you watch the channel dedicated review 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.529
 various gadgets and smart devices 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.150
 just recently my channel was a review 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.880
 smartphone huawei ascend p6 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.950
 and test the front and main camera i 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 decided to bring in a separate video and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 today i will tell exactly about it i 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.039
 I will test the camera on the smartphone 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 about how they shoot that I'm good that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 bad and will make a comparison with the same 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.939
 cameras on the smartphone nokia lumia 925 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680
 a review that I also have on 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.670
 channel which i have already so many times 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.050
 was telling 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 what's the reason why i decided to do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 exactly the case is that just recently 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.190
 and del video clip on the channel in which 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 compared android and windows phone and it was 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.280
 a lot of criticism and negativity in terms of 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.770
 the fact that the alleged camera on android 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 smartphones she's so very good and you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.579
 Ball windows he set not unfairly 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.320
 and stuff like that and with it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 Recently, I was often asked 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.539
 question if you want a smartphone for 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 photo-video shooting, what to take here 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.220
 The answer is unequivocal if we consider 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 smartphone on windows phone to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.470
 lumii are very very good cameras on 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 Android devices are only good 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 flagship I have not seen cheap 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.119
 Android smartphones where would be good 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
 Kolya 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.240
 so the windows phone shaft and the smartphone 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.040
 under her control was not given in vain 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.040
 and today I will show you why 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 so smart phone huavei honor 6 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.770
 as befits a modern device 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.780
 equipped with two front cameras 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.969
 the camera has a maximum resolution of 5 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.539
 megapixels and great for 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.000
 selfies and skype calls 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.460
 for example the rear main camera has 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.369
 13 megapixel resolution LED 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.530
 flash and sensor from sony what 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.210
 bad from the back with me camera the thing is 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 that it is located the top corner olya 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.369
 iphone and very often when shooting when you 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 hold the smartphone you can involuntarily 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.149
 fingers and cover the camera 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.229
 wide angle so even if the finger 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.360
 stick out quite a bit 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.700
 he can get into the picture and influence 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.750
 I get the result very often 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.579
 faced with this problem and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.440
 adapt myself to adapt with me 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.010
 It did not work when you hold 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.200
 smartphone like that for shooting then finger here 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.750
 here on this face constantly climbs into 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.079
 the lens is very bad and very comfortable 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.079
 so the camera is centered 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.239
 in the middle of the smartphone back side 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.790
 the most successful and correct option on 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.889
 my mind and if the camera were here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.750
 shifted at least in the middle it would be 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.690
 much better and even better if she 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.280
 was here right here in place of labels she 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.120
 the most correct and well located 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:00.530
 the camera is generally a 13 megapixel camera and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.639
 it turned out so average enough 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.560
 traditional type and nothing 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.700
 different pictures she does 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.590
 max trans resolution 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.859
 megapixels it's all about adjusting 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.019
 under certain conditions you can of course 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.580
 even by adjusting the white balance and 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.920
 some settings aisa for example 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.270
 Well, like this, for example, select the mode 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.830
 decoration and you can choose alice but 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.440
 Unfortunately, the maximum iso value 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.560
 limited indicator and iso 800 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.180
 minimum 100 so generally not very 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120
 roam white balance settings 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 also not very extensive lamp on 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.960
 collective light fluorescent lamp and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.600
 overcast so general also not 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.730
 go wild and a iso and white balance 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.880
 works fine on automatic 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.530
 settings and do something here 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.390
 here 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.770
 supernaturally you will fail 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.270
 focus cameras quickly enough and 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.960
 for this indicator, no claims 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.120
 arises 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.980
 what else can you say about this camera when 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.050
 good lighting shots are obtained 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.390
 not bad with a decent detail all 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.790
 great but as soon as 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.970
 lighting you getting a little worse 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.440
 if you are really overcast or something 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.360
 not yet 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.750
 the pictures are very very 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.480
 mediocre and camera on nokia lumia 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.489
 925 is able to issue at times more 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.500
 quality picture with the same 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.510
 conditions with good lighting 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.200
 photos are obtained on both 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.590
 devices 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.740
 about the same and even in places 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.720
 Honor 6 picture may turn out more 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.490
 interesting because of the higher 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.890
 matrix resolution but this again with 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.600
 very very good dark lighting in 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.630
 low light conditions 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.680
 main camera on nokia lumia 925 on 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.530
 head is stronger 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.210
 rather than the huavei honor 6 in this you 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.810
 can verify yourself on 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.940
 test shots the same goes for and 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.280
 video filming to shoot in the dark on honda 6 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.230
 impossible neither photo nor video 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.460
 nothing good came of it 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.530
 the shots are terrible very noisy lumia 925 on 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.370
 head surpasses huavei honor 6 by 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.370
 main camera 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.570
 now go to the fatal chamber 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.810
 and here the situation changes drastically to 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.360
 Hall of iPhones 6 installed matrix 5 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.400
 megapixels and due to this frontal 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.830
 the camera can do very high quality 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.900
 selfies very high quality group shots 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.420
 and they are really very pleasant. 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.030
 on nokia lumia 925 front camera 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.850
 very weak and very mediocre 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.090
 and in no way can compete 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.200
 and compete with the camera on the huavei honor 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.020
 6 again test images and examples 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.430
 videos you this clearly 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.190
 demonstrate can see and 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.730
 compare this video test of the front camera 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.590
 overnight or 925 conditions of insufficient 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.260
 lighting as you can see 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.350
 noise and large enough and quality 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.590
 the image is so-so and the video shooting 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.960
 cameras on the floor of the iPhone 6 front in 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.760
 low light conditions here 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.050
 picture is better than nokia 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.360
 lumia 925 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.950
 noise and of course also present but 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.080
 In general, our position looks somewhat 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.380
 it is better 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.460
 But judge for yourself that in the end 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.590
 main camera on huavei honor 6 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.930
 It turned out very mediocre and 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.320
 very weak and even such enough 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.470
 old smartphones like many people 925 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.770
 on the head exceeds the iPhone's Hall 6 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.250
 the main camera quality received 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.410
 pictures for easy shooting and recording 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.090
 video 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:04.560
 android smartphone to exit 6 is not at all 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.590
 competitor and with it 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.600
 The front camera on Honor 6 is quite 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.420
 quite nice she will let you do 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.310
 good selfie she will allow you without 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.430
 problems to call on skype communicate with 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.290
 friends, acquaintances and relatives and 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.320
 its quality is very good and 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.500
 very decent level regret me 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.350
 Now there is no device like nokia 730 or 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.440
 735 to see what 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.060
 quality there is a front camera on 925 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.730
 Rome front camera is very 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.520
 mediocre of seriously inferior 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:42.150
 Honor 6 which summarizes the Huawei Honor 6 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.700
 can not play the role 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:48.400
 camera phone and generally for photo and video 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.260
 shooting he does not suit you to do selfie 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.840
 on the front camera is unlikely to be 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.660
 constantly therefore in terms of photo video 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.310
 shooting he is weak at this all here 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.530
 here's a little confused comparative 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.720
 review with you as always I was Vakhrushi 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.040
 huang subscribe to the channel put 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.470
 likes and tie up our group 

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.470
