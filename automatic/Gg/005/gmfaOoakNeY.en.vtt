16-bit limitations in place they do look
pretty<00:01:15.540> decent<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.439> they're<00:01:16.560> animated

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pretty decent and they're animated

pretty<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.729> wish<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> could<00:01:18.600> say<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> same

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
pretty well I wish I could say the same

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380 
pretty well I wish I could say the same
for<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> controls<00:01:19.890> however<00:01:20.130> woody<00:01:20.970> slides

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
for the controls however woody slides

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
for the controls however woody slides
around<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.110> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> floppy

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
around a lot kind of like a floppy

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630 
around a lot kind of like a floppy
cowboy<00:01:24.450> doll<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> guess<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.979> platforming

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cowboy doll I guess and the platforming

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
cowboy doll I guess and the platforming
can<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.030> pretty<00:01:27.210> frustrating<00:01:27.900> especially

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
can get pretty frustrating especially

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
can get pretty frustrating especially
when<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.130> hard<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> where<00:01:29.939> you're

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
when it's hard to see where you're

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
when it's hard to see where you're
supposed<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> land<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.829> also<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.340> his

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
supposed to land you can also use his

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
supposed to land you can also use his
rope<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> stun<00:01:33.299> enemies<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.020> swing<00:01:34.350> from

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
rope to stun enemies and swing from

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
rope to stun enemies and swing from
various<00:01:34.920> hooks<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.880> it'll<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.360> quite<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> bit

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
various hooks but it'll take quite a bit

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
various hooks but it'll take quite a bit
of<00:01:36.869> practice<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.920> survive<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of practice to really survive in this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
of practice to really survive in this
game<00:01:39.210> even<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> increase<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.680> hit

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
game even if you increase your hit

points<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> options<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
points and the options so it's not that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
points and the options so it's not that
I<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.799> mind<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.280> challenge<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
I don't mind a good challenge but it's a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
I don't mind a good challenge but it's a
bit<00:01:45.540> surprising<00:01:46.170> considering<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.920> game's

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bit surprising considering the game's

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.210 
bit surprising considering the game's
target<00:01:47.640> audience<00:01:48.030> ah<00:01:48.409> yes<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> good<00:01:49.829> old<00:01:50.009> days

target audience ah yes the good old days

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:05.179

when<00:01:50.549> even<00:01:50.909> kids<00:01:51.180> games<00:01:51.540> were<00:01:51.780> tough<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.259> nails

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.279 

but<00:02:06.189> for<00:02:06.460> me<00:02:06.579> tough<00:02:07.210> games<00:02:07.479> also<00:02:07.929> need<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.170> be

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
but for me tough games also need to be

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.859 
but for me tough games also need to be
fun<00:02:08.590> or<00:02:08.920> I'm<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.220> not<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:10.000> continue<00:02:10.660> I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
have a hard time getting into this one

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.449 
have a hard time getting into this one
when<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.480> comes<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.840> 16-bit<00:02:14.500> Disney<00:02:14.920> stuff

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
when it comes to 16-bit Disney stuff

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.820 
when it comes to 16-bit Disney stuff
give<00:02:15.610> me<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> Latin<00:02:16.300> or<00:02:16.450> Lion<00:02:16.750> King<00:02:17.080> any<00:02:17.319> day<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
it's not that I don't like the Toy Story

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.910 
it's not that I don't like the Toy Story
movies<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.500> anything

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
movies or anything

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.070 
movies or anything
they're<00:02:21.190> definitely<00:02:21.400> well-done<00:02:22.120> films<00:02:22.569> but

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
they're definitely well-done films but

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.750 
they're definitely well-done films but
the<00:02:23.230> technological<00:02:24.040> breakthroughs<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the technological breakthroughs and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.940 
the technological breakthroughs and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
innovations made by Pixar in that case
didn't<00:02:27.819> really<00:02:28.060> translate<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> game<00:02:29.049> and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
didn't really translate to the game and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.110 
didn't really translate to the game and
this<00:02:29.769> definitely<00:02:30.190> feels<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.700> bit<00:02:30.849> like<00:02:30.910> a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
this definitely feels a bit like a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.630 
this definitely feels a bit like a
derivative<00:02:31.720> cash-in<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.459> you're<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
derivative cash-in but if you're a
