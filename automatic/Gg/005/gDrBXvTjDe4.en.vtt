00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.350
 Hello everyone today, I want to finally 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:21.280
 Do a review of the means of the brand Dr. Ali 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.949
 Ji and I got them already about three 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.949
 weeks ago and all this time tried 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.939
 You can say so in general, let's 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.819
 let's start I asked them to send me 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.920
 funds to your taste 

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:39.909
 Called what he said I was normal 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.050
 skin and they sent me two remedies 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:47.710
 such a moisturizing face cream for 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.329
 normal skin and in general I do not know 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.389
 Why did it happen to me? 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.600
 mineral these age-related serum 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:57.809
 I already told you I say so 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.339
 suspended stopped using 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.769
 anti-aging remedies 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.720
 the reason that it seemed to me that somehow 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.880
 still got some kind of negative 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.430
 influence so i decided it was not worth it and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.070
 serum gave try mom in 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.710
 in general, I already have a lot of things 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.840
 gave it a try so mom so 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.720
 feeble probably a couple of times to me this 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.990
 liked the consistency over me too yesterday 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.900
 she tried the castle very much she was liquid 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.480
 well absorbed into the skin has more 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.830
 rich texture as after all this 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.770
 serum and in general there is very comfortable 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.710
 packaging in my opinion is enough 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.290
 qualitatively and with good such batcher 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.909
 easy to handle 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.120
 Generally it seems to me that really 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.220
 serum where good 2 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.830
 all the same as something further and further 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.580
 continue and enjoy because 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.760
 water coins and I gave the eye cream 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.430
 came under Indian cosmetics and more 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 something with boxes but because 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.060
 that moves a lot in 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.240
 anti-aging funds to come so i 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.970
 I used to you here extra week in 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.790
 in general, very pleased to show, but in general 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.090
 I think that maybe these tools are you. 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.580
 already saw the video he gave and a in the trash 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.430
 forging centuries you i know that never again 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.070
 Caramel also had a video but Katya 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.010
 I had other means of such 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.630
 here's the cream since it's still allen jim 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.290
 and here we can see the genie lamp on 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.440
 packaging is not very packaging by the way 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 I liked it very much not so 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:54.400
 I know inspires confidence and generally the cream itself 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.950
 such a white color is tender 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.390
 moisturizing texture is very good 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.510
 lays down on the skin make it very gentle 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.040
 the only thing he has no success therefore 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.980
 here at the moment I have tonal 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.800
 cream, too, there is no singing in the morning, I was the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.320
 use another cream and in the evening I 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.040
 used this moisturizer at all 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.709
 Started using 3 weeks ago 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.340
 I like the effect of smooth skin 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.069
 but now we have 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.220
 apparently some time the cold came 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.160
 Well, that is, for me, -25 is already 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.170
 it's cold and it seems to me that this is me 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.019
 time needs something more nutritious 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.150
 so in general, every day as 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.720
 primary care as primary 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.349
 the cream in my opinion is very cool what is it 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.799
 so let's say the manufacturer promises it 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:52.430
 normal skin moisturizer 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.769
 series by the way I have a boy it 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.470
 moisturizes the skin refreshes and really 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.410
 Well, it has a delicate aroma 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.860
 quickly into trouble and so much become good 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.290
 property for those who in the morning put the cream 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.299
 then you need to quickly make up that cream 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.459
 for a long time I really didn’t drink 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.299
 quickly absorbed and as a base under 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.910
 makeup is noticed on works further what 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.070
 enriched with dead will minerals 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.799
 providing the skin is essential nourishing 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.960
 substances and protection cream composition is included 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.450
 provitamin b5 natural from orbit 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.340
 moisturizers are mini 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.630
 antioxidants full of secrets soothes and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.860
 prevents irritation in general ways 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.690
 applications are not recommended to 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.200
 used in serum complex series 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.820
 magic 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.370
 but as I have already told me unfortunately 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.930
 the image of the age category did not fit 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.919
 this serum that is, if initially 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:56.030
 here it is called mineral 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.389
 anti-aging serum is possible 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.030
 maybe it doesn't mean any other 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.250
 serum but you sent me this one 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.060
 there is not even a ball right in your eyes 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.690
 the mineral is an anti-aging serum therefore it 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.570
 only for my mom but i'm saying that i am 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.090
 Naturally tried on hand 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:22.020
 the consistency is very rich 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.270
 There is she more saturated than cream even 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.630
 a little bit such oily skin even 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.520
 starts a little bit I had a network for 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.610
 It seems to me quite a face 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.810
 a little moisturizing it right away 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:40.919
 feeling nice pens and in general then i would 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.930
 she probably at night and only applied for 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.180
 women of age that is mine they are already behind 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:51.720
 fifty i think she's suitable for 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.550
 morning care in general 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560
 such was my opinion that 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.900
 concerns the shelf life too me 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.570
 pleased ie cream for example after 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.479
 opening jars can be used in 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.660
 During the twelve months so you can 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.780
 Do not be afraid if for example at the time of winter 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.690
 you take another cream then further already 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.060
 in the spring continue to use and think 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.940
 that he will end the house without a period of time 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.100
 because here here here 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.190
 drawn jar opened 312 months 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.229
 this is a big plus because 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.260
 such creams are very common 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.570
 which are a huge bank that are missing 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.160
 literally that for 6 months and not always 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.009
 there are girls like that 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.069
 actively 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.699
 spend the cream that it ends in 6 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.539
 months 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.580
 if the more there is some 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.789
 alternative there any 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.559
 special cases i have for example 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:57.020
 during the winter there when he does not begin 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.949
 buzz I turn on nourishing cream 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.059
 necessarily 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:04.550
 so here is the nuance of serum 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.339
 also in general is valid for 12 months 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.379
 but I think that in principle even under 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:12.409
 nourishing another cream if you 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:14.599
 go she, too, come here 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.490
 actually I had an opinion about 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.370
 I really liked these tools . 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.430
 I think that so many him look 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.330
 really pleased and quality packaging 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.460
 i.e 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.479
 but in my opinion it’s great to come up with everything 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:32.149
 Looks great and quality 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.339
 the product is very pleasant and in general not 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:37.069
 gives no negative effects and 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:40.099
 really skin very gentle overall then 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:41.629
 on this i finish was very glad of you 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.229
 see and meet in the next video 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:44.229
 bye everyone
