Hofstra<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.510> Arboretum<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.350> we're

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
Hofstra is in Arboretum because we're

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
Hofstra is in Arboretum because we're
trying<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> follow<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:56.160> original<00:00:56.370> William

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
trying to follow the original William

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.869 
trying to follow the original William
Hofstra<00:00:57.480> who<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.109> lumbermen<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.160> that's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Hofstra who was a lumbermen and that's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
Hofstra who was a lumbermen and that's
how<00:01:00.059> he<00:01:00.120> made<00:01:00.420> his<00:01:00.570> living<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.140> he<00:01:01.649> collected

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
how he made his living and he collected

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
how he made his living and he collected
trees<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.820> his<00:01:02.969> summer<00:01:03.570> home<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:04.409> Hofstra

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
trees here at his summer home at Hofstra

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
trees here at his summer home at Hofstra
and<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> thought<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.479> Arboretum<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.229> be

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and so we thought and Arboretum would be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.690 
and so we thought and Arboretum would be
more<00:01:07.590> fitting<00:01:07.950> than<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> know

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
more fitting than just a bit you know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
more fitting than just a bit you know
then<00:01:08.939> being<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> garden<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
then being at the time of the garden and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.250 
then being at the time of the garden and
so<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> collection<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> trees<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
so we have a collection of trees that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
so we have a collection of trees that
number<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.159> thousands<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> probably

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
number in the thousands is probably

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.310 
number in the thousands is probably
close<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> 12,000<00:01:16.380> trees<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.299> 625

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
close to 12,000 trees but there are 625

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
close to 12,000 trees but there are 625
distinctly<00:01:19.320> different<00:01:19.619> ones<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> those

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
distinctly different ones out of those

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
distinctly different ones out of those
12,000<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.750> hard<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> say<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.320> like

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
12,000 that's hard to say it's like

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
12,000 that's hard to say it's like
asking<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.729> favorite<00:01:24.090> child

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
asking what which is your favorite child

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.710 
asking what which is your favorite child
or<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:26.720> planting

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
or something like that you know planting

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
or something like that you know planting
I<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.500> probably<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.159> favorite<00:01:29.549> tree<00:01:29.850> which

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I have it probably a favorite tree which

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
I have it probably a favorite tree which
is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> Katsura<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> pine<00:01:31.380> edom<00:01:31.650> close<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is the Katsura in the pine edom close to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
is the Katsura in the pine edom close to
Hager<00:01:32.640> Hall<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.150> Southside<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.630> Hager<00:01:33.869> hole

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Hager Hall and a Southside a Hager hole

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
Hager Hall and a Southside a Hager hole
it's<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> oldest<00:01:35.130> tree<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.909> Japan

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's the oldest tree it's from Japan

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's the oldest tree it's from Japan
it<00:01:36.689> starts<00:01:36.960> at<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> phylum<00:01:37.560> japonicum<00:01:38.220> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it starts at a phylum japonicum it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
it starts at a phylum japonicum it's
about<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> hundred<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:39.960> twenty<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.740> 125<00:01:41.549> years

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
about a hundred and twenty to 125 years

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
about a hundred and twenty to 125 years
old<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.320> magnificent<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
old so it's pretty magnificent when you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
old so it's pretty magnificent when you
go<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> know

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
go up to it and you see it it's you know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
go up to it and you see it it's you know
13<00:01:46.049> feet<00:01:46.350> around<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.640> got<00:01:48.119> quite<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
13 feet around and it's it's got quite a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.399 
13 feet around and it's it's got quite a
statute<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:50.180> but<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.270> far<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.479> plantings<00:01:52.110> go

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
statute to it but as far as plantings go

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.050 
statute to it but as far as plantings go
I<00:01:52.680> mean<00:01:52.979> there's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.820> niche

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I mean there's a lot of little niche

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.429 
I mean there's a lot of little niche
plantings<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.840> campus<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> things<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
plantings on campus and things that

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
plantings on campus and things that
little<00:01:58.439> venues<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.100> we've<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.790> created

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
little venues that we've kind of created

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.160 
little venues that we've kind of created
around<00:02:00.509> campus<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:02.450> are<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.960> comfort

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
around campus that are just for comfort

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
around campus that are just for comfort
and<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.299> aesthetically

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and for you know but also aesthetically

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.559 
and for you know but also aesthetically
pleasing<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.220> things<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
pleasing I think of things like the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.440 
pleasing I think of things like the
horse<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:11.340> West<00:02:11.940> circle

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
horse on West circle

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.500 
horse on West circle
and<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> planting<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.920> native<00:02:14.510> bluestem

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and the planting of a native bluestem

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.339 
and the planting of a native bluestem
grasses<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> grow<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:17.010> Hampstead<00:02:17.790> Plains

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
grasses that grow in Hampstead Plains

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.530 
grasses that grow in Hampstead Plains
which<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.709> Hofstra<00:02:20.099> was<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.819> was<00:02:21.270> built

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
which is what Hofstra was is was built

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.380 
which is what Hofstra was is was built
on<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> native

is<00:02:45.120> probably<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.660> fall<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.920> woody

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
is probably the fall but for woody

and so these things come out in the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.150 
and so these things come out in the
middle<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.720> snow<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.260> they're<00:05:01.830> in<00:05:01.950> full

of<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.860> big<00:05:05.040> features<00:05:05.460> at<00:05:05.610> Hofstra<00:05:05.970> because

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
of the big features at Hofstra because

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.620 
of the big features at Hofstra because
we<00:05:06.540> are<00:05:06.840> Dutch<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.790> we<00:05:08.790> do<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:08.970> lot<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.210> tulips

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
we are Dutch and we do a lot of tulips

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.320 
we are Dutch and we do a lot of tulips
that's<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.770> think<00:05:11.160> something<00:05:12.000> that<00:05:12.030> we<00:05:12.120> look

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
that's I think something that we look

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.900 
that's I think something that we look
forward<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.750> every<00:05:12.990> spring<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.590> April<00:05:14.490> come

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
forward to every spring in April come

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.490 
forward to every spring in April come
out<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.210> daffodils<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.990> we<00:05:16.050> probably<00:05:16.260> have<00:05:16.410> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
out to daffodils and we probably have a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.310 
out to daffodils and we probably have a
couple<00:05:16.730> 250<00:05:17.730> 300<00:05:18.150> thousand<00:05:18.630> daffodils<00:05:19.080> that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
couple 250 300 thousand daffodils that

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.680 
couple 250 300 thousand daffodils that
over<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.070> years<00:05:20.370> we've<00:05:20.640> planted<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.450> know<00:05:21.570> we

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
over the years we've planted you know we

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.480 
over the years we've planted you know we
might<00:05:21.870> plant<00:05:22.110> eight<00:05:22.290> ten<00:05:22.590> thousand<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.130> year

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
might plant eight ten thousand a year

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.820 
might plant eight ten thousand a year
but<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.300> daffodils<00:05:24.750> come<00:05:24.960> back<00:05:25.170> year<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.560> year

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
but the daffodils come back year to year

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.620 
but the daffodils come back year to year
so<00:05:26.280> these<00:05:26.430> things<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.940> April<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.360> can<00:05:27.390> look

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
so these things in April you can look

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.240 
so these things in April you can look
even<00:05:27.840> in<00:05:28.080> March<00:05:28.320> sometimes<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:28.950> can<00:05:29.100> look

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
even in March sometimes you can look

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.520 
even in March sometimes you can look
forward<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.780> thousands<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:30.900> daffodils

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
forward to thousands of daffodils

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.290 
forward to thousands of daffodils
but<00:05:31.890> then<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.130> tulips<00:05:32.490> come<00:05:32.730> into<00:05:32.910> bloom<00:05:33.030> and

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
but then the tulips come into bloom and
