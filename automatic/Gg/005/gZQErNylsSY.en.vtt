total of three objectives but there's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910 
total of three objectives but there's
two<00:01:56.700> targets<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> start<00:01:57.719> off<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.049> half

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

two targets when you start off on half
of<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.250> team<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.229> think<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.350> um<00:02:01.729> two<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.360> I

think there's two platoons in this one

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.370 
think there's two platoons in this one
and<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.960> platoon<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> arm

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and when platoon would go to arm

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.310 
and when platoon would go to arm
but<00:02:10.100> go<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.280> um<00:02:10.610> well<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.660> think<00:02:11.750> they're<00:02:11.990> not

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
but go to um well I think they're not

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.390 
but go to um well I think they're not
actually<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.620> think<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.800> only<00:02:12.950> one<00:02:13.250> platoon

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
actually I think it's only one platoon

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.130 
actually I think it's only one platoon
and<00:02:13.850> then<00:02:14.390> they<00:02:14.510> uh<00:02:14.540> whatever<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.880> your<00:02:17.140> your

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and then they uh whatever the your your

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.250 
and then they uh whatever the your your
squad<00:02:18.590> leader<00:02:18.620> tells<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.880> go<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.870> or<00:02:21.080> b

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
squad leader tells you to go like a or b

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.830 
squad leader tells you to go like a or b
um<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:22.550> would<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.030> supposed<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.540> go<00:02:23.660> there

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
um you would you supposed to go there

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.470 
um you would you supposed to go there
you<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.490> if<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.670> want<00:02:25.880> extra

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
you don't have to but if you want extra

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040 
you don't have to but if you want extra
fraga<00:02:26.780> um<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.500> point<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.760> would<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.780> would<00:02:29.810> do

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
fraga um a point you would you would do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.140 
fraga um a point you would you would do
it<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.520> should<00:02:31.760> do<00:02:31.970> it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
it and I think you should do it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.930 
it and I think you should do it
sometimes<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.380> understand<00:02:33.800> maybe<00:02:34.340> you're

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
sometimes I can understand maybe you're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.460 
sometimes I can understand maybe you're
ready<00:02:35.090> captured<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> area<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.230> want<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
ready captured the area you want to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.650 
ready captured the area you want to
leave<00:02:36.680> um<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.400> help<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.090> your<00:02:38.240> teammates

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
leave um and help out your teammates

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.810 
leave um and help out your teammates
when<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.320> mean<00:02:39.500> help<00:02:39.680> out<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.010> other<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.790> other

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
when I mean help out the other the other

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.270 
when I mean help out the other the other
half<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.180> your<00:02:41.240> team<00:02:41.540> when<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.920> squad<00:02:43.250> leader

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
half of your team when your squad leader

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240 
half of your team when your squad leader
starts<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> stay<00:02:44.000> here<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.200> think<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.070> should

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
starts to stay here I think you should

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
starts to stay here I think you should
just<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:46.490> there<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.330> know<00:02:47.450> end<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:48.110> faster

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
just go there and you know end it faster

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040 
just go there and you know end it faster
so<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.100> can<00:02:49.730> go<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.030> third<00:02:50.180> tart<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.690> third

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
so you can go to the third tart a third

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.410 
so you can go to the third tart a third
objective<00:02:51.200> because<00:02:51.650> um<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.940> third<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:53.330> is

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
objective because um the third one is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.300 
objective because um the third one is
really<00:02:53.720> hard<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.990> do<00:02:54.230> sometimes<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:55.100> easy

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
really hard to do sometimes it's easy

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
really hard to do sometimes it's easy
most<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.000> time<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.300> really<00:02:56.660> hard<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.020> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
most of the time it's really hard to to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.000 
most of the time it's really hard to to
do<00:02:57.590> because<00:02:57.740> it's<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.610> all<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.450> um

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
do because it's it's all it's um

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.770 
do because it's it's all it's um
everyone's<00:03:01.010> there<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:02.210> know<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.600> gonna

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
everyone's there you know so it's gonna

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.930 
everyone's there you know so it's gonna
be<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> big<00:03:03.110> battle<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.560> lot<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.160> deaths<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.820> it's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
be a big battle a lot of deaths and it's

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.610 
be a big battle a lot of deaths and it's
one<00:03:05.120> objective<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.200> hard<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.530> get

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
one objective so it's really hard to get

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.820 
one objective so it's really hard to get
in<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:07.640> um<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.300> then<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.720> defense<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.590> really

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
in so um and then the defense is really

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.830 
in so um and then the defense is really
strong<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.940> next<00:03:11.090> ones<00:03:11.300> like<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> capture

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
strong on the next ones like a capture

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.660 
strong on the next ones like a capture
the<00:03:11.900> flag<00:03:11.990> except<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.800> vehicle<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.580> up

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
the flag except it's a vehicle it's up

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.580 
the flag except it's a vehicle it's up
to<00:03:14.500> 128<00:03:15.500> players<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.780> your<00:03:17.780> objective<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.380> to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
to 128 players and your objective is to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.030 
to 128 players and your objective is to
capture<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.700> vehicles<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.990> your<00:03:21.650> score

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
capture these vehicles and your score

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.790 
capture these vehicles and your score
and<00:03:22.190> that's<00:03:22.970> about<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.560> keep<00:03:24.710> on

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
and that's about it I think you keep on

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.990 
and that's about it I think you keep on
doing<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.100> till<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.370> end<00:03:25.490> of<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.640> match<00:03:25.730> I

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
doing it till the end of the match I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.450 
doing it till the end of the match I
never<00:03:26.330> played<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.140> play<00:03:27.890> once<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.280> never

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
never played it play once I never

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.480 
never played it play once I never
finished<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.860> didn't<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.040> I'll<00:03:31.340> get

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
finished it I didn't like it I'll get

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.720 
finished it I didn't like it I'll get
into<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.880> later<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:33.410> yeah<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.160> then<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.550> next

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
into it later but yeah and then the next

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.440 
into it later but yeah and then the next
one<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.140> domination<00:03:36.140> which<00:03:36.800> is<00:03:37.090> 256<00:03:38.090> players

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
one is domination which is 256 players

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.380 
one is domination which is 256 players
with<00:03:38.690> 8<00:03:38.930> target<00:03:39.380> objectives<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.550> then<00:03:41.180> when

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
with 8 target objectives and then when

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.240 
with 8 target objectives and then when
you<00:03:41.570> unclear<00:03:42.140> all<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.350> think<00:03:42.860> when<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.070> clear

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
you unclear all I think when you clear

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.320 
you unclear all I think when you clear
all<00:03:43.370> am<00:03:43.790> when<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.870> clear<00:03:45.230> some<00:03:46.330> certain

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
all am when you clear some certain

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.140 
all am when you clear some certain
objectives<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.830> push<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.280> enemy<00:03:49.400> back<00:03:49.580> to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
objectives as you push the enemy back to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.000 
objectives as you push the enemy back to
the<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.990> fuel<00:03:51.970> buildings<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:54.110> finery<00:03:54.410> then

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the the fuel buildings the finery then

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.930 
the the fuel buildings the finery then
you'll<00:03:55.280> get<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:56.950> you'llyou'll<00:03:57.950> me<00:03:58.160> you'll

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
you'll get to you'llyou'll me you'll

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750 
you'll get to you'llyou'll me you'll
have<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> capture<00:03:59.390> two<00:03:59.660> objectives<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.760> kind

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
have to capture two objectives and kind

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.150 
have to capture two objectives and kind
of<00:04:01.820> like<00:04:02.440> sabotage<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:03.770> then<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.010> have<00:04:04.130> to

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
of like sabotage but then you have to
