that<00:01:19.870> is<00:01:20.230> pretty<00:01:20.980> steep

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.720 

not<00:01:33.350> as<00:01:33.649> easy<00:01:34.189> as<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.429> looks

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.040 

while<00:01:38.730> rock<00:01:39.000> climbing<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.690> need<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
while rock climbing all you need to do

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.920 
while rock climbing all you need to do
is<00:01:40.200> obviously<00:01:40.650> stay<00:01:41.130> focused<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.910> it's<00:01:42.660> good

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is obviously stay focused and it's good

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
is obviously stay focused and it's good
to<00:01:43.080> start<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.620> something<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.130> excitement

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to start doing something with excitement

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
to start doing something with excitement
before<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.330> start<00:01:45.660> doing<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:45.900> climbing

before you start doing your climbing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
before you start doing your climbing
because<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.100> takes<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.400> lot<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.790> energy

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you have to figure out what devices you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.270 
you have to figure out what devices you
can<00:01:51.000> hold<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> use<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:53.010> toes

your hands and your fingers three four

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
your hands and your fingers three four
times<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.570> grow<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
times you do it and it will grow on to

times you do it and it will grow on to
you<00:01:58.440> it's<00:01:58.920> something<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.660> more

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you it's something that is much more

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.570 
you it's something that is much more
strenuous<00:02:01.410> than<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:01.800> picking<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.370> 10

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
strenuous than just picking up a 10

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.610 
strenuous than just picking up a 10
pound<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.060> weight<00:02:03.300> or<00:02:03.600> something<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.440> that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
pound of weight or something like that

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.780 
pound of weight or something like that
because<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.070> pick<00:02:05.790> up

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
because you pick up

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.410 
because you pick up
body<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:09.100> takes<00:02:09.310> all<00:02:09.640> your<00:02:09.940> upper<00:02:10.240> body

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.800 

it<00:02:26.069> wasn't<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.640> difficult<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.390> thought<00:02:27.630> we

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it wasn't as difficult as I thought we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.320
