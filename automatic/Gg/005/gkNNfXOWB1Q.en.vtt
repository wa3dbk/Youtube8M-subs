00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.470

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.930
 which is better well these 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.820
 luminaires 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.290
 so we have to be very very 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 attentive 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.440
 ok here we have another one of the strollers 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.360

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.360
 get the third mini kits 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:18.070
 it's great that more here we have another 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.070
 luminaire so we destroyed it too 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.720
 to le monde we have to be very attentive 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.400
 here we have another little sign and that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 way then let's get the room 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.310
 mini kids 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 very good there was the sixth luminary 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.660
 to see what else the missiles are 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 destroying 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.670
 I will do it general 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.040
 pus 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.040
 little by little they will destroy us 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.549
 but we have to be very 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.710
 attentive very aware of where they are 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.290
 our mini kits 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 We have 4 mini kits 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 and I forgot to activate the multiplier 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.050
 of pieces x2 that what we were going and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.350
 we continue 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.740
 here we have the eighth luminaire and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.420
 we had a rickety cab s have 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.880
 that destroy it to get another mini 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.970
 kit also when we go through again 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.970
 there 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.010
 I will go down very well and we have the tenth 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.170
 luminary and in that way we get the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.830
 fifth mini kings 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 very well 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.020
 what else do we have here 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.760
 We are going to be 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.760
 and attentive with wide eyes 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.290
 it's great in our very superhero 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.290
 and soon we will get 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.110
 so that's very important too 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.190
 ok let's destroy this part where 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.810
 the joker robot expels the toxic when 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.120
 we study that because it's going to look like 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.390
 public through the streets a few boxes of 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.020
 violet color with yellow 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.020
 OK 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.720
 here we have the first and of those 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.720
 There are 5 boxes 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.630
 when we get to destroy the five of us 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.640
 they are going to give a new mini that is worth here 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.530
 we have the taxi and that way 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.840
 let's get our sixth mini 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.730
 kits 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.210
 what else here in the hand of the statue 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.360
 there we had our seventh mini kids 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.080
 very well 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.370
 I would recommend that you give pause 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.570
 to see the mini kits we got 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.390
 okay guys there was our second 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.620
 statue and we only need to destroy one 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.160
 more here we have another of the boxes 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.160
 violets 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.989
 it's great 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.989
 let's see we have 7 mini that we already have 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.560
 our superhero seems to me 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.450
 and here we have another box 4 of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.310
 5 it's worth there we had a little tree and in 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.760
 the little tree was our citizen in 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.400
 I recommend you to put pause 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.910
 to see it better since this is very very 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.910
 Quick 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.550
 it's great 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.610
 let's study the missiles these 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.770
 and what I'm looking for now is the 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.770
 fifth violet box 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.230
 to see where it is 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.240
 let's go destroying the missiles these 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.830
 It was already gone and it has happened to me 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.370
 well nothing happens and it will be in the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.370
 next turn 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.960
 you know that here they are giving 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.190
 turns until they do not destroy the robot 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.590
 joker 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.289
 we are going to destroy this part of the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.969
 robots where it expels 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:21.209
 the toxic this can do it 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:23.789
 three times but I recommend you only 

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.169
 do it twice to get the 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.979
 mini kits to the third one because 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.979
 finish the level 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.289
 OK, very good 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.360
 we have more missiles 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.909
 and you have to be very careful to 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.860
 get the violet box that 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.860
 we were looking for 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.580
 we are going to approach her here she is 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.680
 look there is perfect and that way 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.680
 we got our eighth mini kids 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.310
 great here we are going to destroy this part 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.689
 I told them to do the second time 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.489
 we are going to do it 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.619
 and when we destroy this, it's going to 

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:07.619
 look like a helicopter 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.029
 where is the bridge more or less 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.590
 here we have the statue the third 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.529
 giant statue and that way 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.529
 we got our ninth mini kit and 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.989
 over here we're going to get 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.369
 not here around here, yes here is the 

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:27.949
 helicopter that I know I was telling you there at 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:30.319
 background and that way we get the 10th 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.129
 Mary, as you can see, we already have 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.449
 citizen in danger and the superhero 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.820
 for boys this level we have already 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.990
 Completed 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.000
 so let's finish the mission is 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.160
 let's destroy this for the third time if 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.750
 it's already very good 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.070
 ok guys here this is over 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.170
 mission in free mode I hope you have 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.240
 liked a lot I would recommend that you 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.000
 Give pause to see the mini kits that 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.400
 We find the endangered risen since 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.380
 this progresses very fast finally 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.980
 we got the superhero and we got to the 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.130
 one hundred percent of the coins 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:10.080
 It's great and we managed to rescue the 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.100
 citizen in danger very well that more 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.200
 finally we get the most 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.140
 important our 10 mini kits 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.620
 That is to see what goes way 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:24.370
 it looks like the batmobile we're going to see that 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.370
