it's<00:01:50.759> better<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.689> opinion<00:01:52.369> next<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.640> have

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it's better in my opinion next we have

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.770 
it's better in my opinion next we have
road<00:01:54.210> guard<00:01:54.470> road<00:01:55.470> guard<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.390> while<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> it

road guard road guard and while that it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.350 
road guard road guard and while that it
both

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
both

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.920 
both
in<00:01:58.660> category<00:01:58.960> number<00:01:59.550> four<00:02:00.550> because<00:02:01.450> I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
in category number four because I

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.960 
in category number four because I
couldn't<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.740> couldn't<00:02:02.950> separate<00:02:03.790> them

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
couldn't I couldn't separate them

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.510 
couldn't I couldn't separate them
they're<00:02:04.150> both<00:02:04.390> very<00:02:04.870> they<00:02:05.680> work<00:02:05.890> together<00:02:06.100> you

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
they're both very they work together you

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.419 
they're both very they work together you
can't<00:02:06.790> have<00:02:07.030> one<00:02:07.360> or<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.570> other<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.890> guess

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
can't have one or the other so I guess

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.250 
can't have one or the other so I guess
we<00:02:09.550> should<00:02:09.700> go<00:02:09.789> with<00:02:09.910> worldedit<00:02:10.330> first<00:02:10.750> won't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
we should go with worldedit first won't

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.590 
we should go with worldedit first won't

Eddie you / us one and you can create
regions<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.820> use<00:02:16.030> world<00:02:16.360> guard

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
regions and then you can use world guard

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.130 
regions and then you can use world guard
to<00:02:16.990> protect<00:02:17.200> those<00:02:17.560> regions<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.300> make<00:02:20.110> sure

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
to protect those regions so make sure

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.750 
to protect those regions so make sure
you<00:02:20.380> get<00:02:20.500> both<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.860> those<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.490> why

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
you get both of those and that is why

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.250 
you get both of those and that is why

up permissions based plugin I used to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.530 
up permissions based plugin I used to
use<00:03:37.290> permission<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.920> X<00:03:38.159> and<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.879> was<00:03:39.060> learning

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
use permission to X and I was learning

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.899 
use permission to X and I was learning
how<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> use<00:03:40.079> group<00:03:40.470> manager<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
how to use group manager and it is so

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.929 
how to use group manager and it is so
much<00:03:42.120> easier<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.810> much<00:03:42.989> faster<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
much easier so much faster and the

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.520 
much easier so much faster and the
ability<00:03:44.939> inheritance<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.810> by<00:03:46.109> far<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
ability inheritance is by far the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.369 
ability inheritance is by far the
easiest<00:03:46.859> i<00:03:47.549> will<00:03:47.730> get<00:03:47.939> in-depth<00:03:48.329> sooner<00:03:49.200> on

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
easiest i will get in-depth sooner on

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.979 
easiest i will get in-depth sooner on
group<00:03:49.799> manager<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:51.120> now<00:03:51.150> i<00:03:51.329> will<00:03:51.959> show

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
gonna see that this see the inheritance

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.259 
gonna see that this see the inheritance
makes<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.310> permissions<00:04:17.310> will<00:04:17.489> pass<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:18.000> to

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
makes it so permissions will pass on to

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.949 
makes it so permissions will pass on to
a<00:04:18.299> new<00:04:18.389> group<00:04:18.959> which<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.709> very<00:04:20.009> awesome<00:04:20.310> and
