00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.280 
with the Brutes you get a brute plasma
rifle<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.680> say<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.549> red<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
rifle I say that just because it's red a

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
rifle I say that just because it's red a
mauler<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> Spiker<00:01:18.530> now<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:21.259> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
mauler and a Spiker now I got out the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.190 
mauler and a Spiker now I got out the
other<00:01:22.470> Prowler<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
other Prowler so you can see the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
other Prowler so you can see the
difference<00:01:25.970> how<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> new<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.630> silver

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.389 

I<00:01:31.109> think<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.130> better<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> silver

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
I think it looks better in the silver

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.340 
I think it looks better in the silver
especially<00:01:35.450> when<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.929> new<00:01:37.049> brute

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
especially when you have the new brute

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.679 
especially when you have the new brute
chieftain<00:01:37.560> charge<00:01:38.149> look<00:01:39.149> how<00:01:39.270> great<00:01:39.479> those

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
chieftain charge look how great those

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.330 
chieftain charge look how great those
two<00:01:39.929> sets<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.380> together<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.920> matching

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
two sets go together those matching

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.109 
two sets go together those matching
colors<00:01:43.250> definitely<00:01:44.250> recommend<00:01:44.670> picking<00:01:44.819> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
colors definitely recommend picking it
