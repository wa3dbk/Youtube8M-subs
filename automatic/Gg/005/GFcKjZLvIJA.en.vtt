00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello and nostalgic critic I'm this 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.799
 remember so you don't have to be long 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.809
 a long time ago an article appeared in the network in which 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.549
 there was a very dark statement that 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.060
 latest tom &amp; jerry series they 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.800
 committed suicide when 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.369
 rummage on the Internet can be found many 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.439
 articles broadcasting the same thing 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.300
 last corbet yardage to woven barber 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.899
 the screen ends darkly sitting on 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 flights of heroes and those awaiting death 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.340
 maybe the way it is is not it if 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.770
 rummage even deeper you can find that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.840
 many channels do not show this series and 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.000
 even now only rarely can June 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.820
 sees on american television hell 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.680
 take it could well be the most 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.540
 hilarious cruel couple finished his 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 existence in the most frightening way of 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.930
 of all 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.910
 sense we all saw other projects with 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.430
 them and after some I wanted to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.410
 they died the notes of the makers of ghana and barber 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.270
 and they really did that to them. 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.130
 did they really do something 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.220
 so terrible with their most famous 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.399
 heroes of happiness 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.649
 take a look at all the sacrifice 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.149
 called sadness sad cat and yes for 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.979
 starts from the house sitting on 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.289
 rail tracks and waiting for now 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.850
 Jamie will move him sadly looking 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.159
 it's his inner voice telling 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.840
 us his story is apparently tom and jerry 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.119
 become best friends but don't be afraid 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.950
 each other's time not perfectly back 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.560
 the woman went into their life and ruined everything 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.350
 then he falls in love scoring jerini 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 then she falls in love with another cat tom 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.859
 by all means trying to get her back 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.289
 literally selling myself on organs but 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.909
 no result reaches the end 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.009
 ends she marries another 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 when something enters home in such anguish that 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.209
 he lies on the rails 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.619
 Jerry, of course, mentions his own 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.450
 perfect relationship but suddenly 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.119
 discovers that his girlfriend has gone to 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.630
 to another and in the end he asks at home 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 move over 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:02.740
 women have a brother on and more important than animals 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.569
 slightly humane gateway and so there are two 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.209
 points of view from which to consider 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.160
 ending 1 volume and jerry clobber or oak 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.349
 with loved threw each other all than 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.299
 it can and cannot seem to me that with a big 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.920
 the probability of the train will not survive but with 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.420
 other what 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.550
 he and boundless reality can 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.319
 work in both directions premiere 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.180
 Adams family happened all that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.959
 should have killed them however the bullet and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.580
 electric chair beside 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.380
 so you can say acceptance of your 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.310
 fate made them go back to the laws 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.989
 Well the reality is a good idea but there 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.459
 there is one more thing tom and jerry not 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.400
 very limited by time frame 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.080
 all the series are slightly different house 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.459
 the boss has changed a little bit 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.200
 change damn jerry 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.709
 threw on the door squirrel whole cloud 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 He attributed that time was back after 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.030
 each adventure is like stupid bastards 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.100
 so again u have a reality with almost no 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.110
 borders monster more importantly it 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 the last series is not the last 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 series the last series is actually called 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.380
 nurses and they don't commit suicide 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.260
 don't look after the baby 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.330
 the baby is not so depressingly true on 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.799
 actually hanna-barbera two more years 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.620
 created cartoons after so 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.360
 called the last series so 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 it is clear that the duet did not come 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.799
 depressive end so what am I 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 so controversial that not even everywhere 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.970
 way from Well because finishing off 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.130
 and tom and jerry and nice to cum 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.530
 flying over time people have changed 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.370
 perception of times and gender and yes not even 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.989
 prokhor violence this does not mean that people 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.820
 stopped dying from phillipe shot 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.600
 geneve great heights but the atmosphere has become 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.430
 more joyful removed from reality and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 the same scene completes the joke though 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 so hard to take two 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.590
 characters we love so much again 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.239
 as if we did not see this thing 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.609
 refid 0 plus mother could not 17 years 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.739
 put I remember watching this series 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.109
 still a child and then she is not strong 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.880
 upset me understood joke jerry 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.680
 thinks that having run away all this with him 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.049
 this never happens but such 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.239
 happens and he certainly does the same 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.069
 like the tone ok button I love black varna 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.440
 not every child of his planet will accept 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.060
 quite serious as hell 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.530
 shows the internet even adult 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.049
 perceived what is happening in full 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.410
 serious and so committed or tom and jerry 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.479
 price murder pastor siri don't we think 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.470
 never saw their corpses they experienced 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.539
 things are worse 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.159
 Obviously, this is a joke ending. 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.070
 more importantly dozens of cartoon flash drive 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.479
 the last series if for what it showed 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.860
 so this is what we have become more 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.320
 sensitive collectors jokes and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.240
 nectar hero joke about suicide in one 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.240
 Series Louis would not have caused excitement and 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.760
 tom and jerry are not comfortable with much 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.120
 and even power is a shocking ending 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.650
 who found people here is not this 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.770
 fun series thinking on the topic 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.630
 a fun ending in the end she doesn't 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.610
 as epic or dark as many 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.150
 suggest this is just a silly joke 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.710
 about obsession with love seriously oh well 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.970
 generally in the world associated with love in 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.570
 culture can force anyone 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.570
 commit suicide
