seem<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.859> be<00:02:03.950> best<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:04.429> this<00:02:04.609> weapon<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.179> this

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
seem to be best on this weapon and this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.330 
seem to be best on this weapon and this

gun is pretty good at fly right so you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.520

burst<00:02:11.390> weapon<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.020> do<00:02:12.200> recommend<00:02:12.770> having<00:02:13.370> fast

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
mag or at least extended clips so you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.490 
mag or at least extended clips so you
