cover at the same time that we were

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
cover at the same time that we were
actually<00:01:45.930> designing<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.860> iPad<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.790> two<00:01:48.000> are

video mirroring just connect your iPad

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.479 
video mirroring just connect your iPad
to<00:04:12.370> your<00:04:12.489> HDTV<00:04:12.909> and<00:04:13.540> it'll<00:04:13.900> mirror<00:04:14.489> exactly

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
to your HDTV and it'll mirror exactly

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.879 
to your HDTV and it'll mirror exactly
what<00:04:15.640> you're<00:04:15.790> doing<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.359> your<00:04:16.600> iPad<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.229> any

what you're doing on your iPad in any

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.890 
what you're doing on your iPad in any
orientation<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:20.049> full<00:04:20.919> 1080p<00:04:21.570> we've<00:04:22.570> done

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.080 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.169> with<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.590> iPad<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.639> never

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
things with this iPad that we never

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.270 
things with this iPad that we never
could<00:04:25.389> have<00:04:25.449> done<00:04:25.630> before<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:27.010> because

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
could have done before and it's because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.850 
could have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.000> lot<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.270> new<00:04:28.600> innovation<00:04:29.290> driving

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.029 
there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:31.510> starts<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.260> new<00:04:32.410> dual-core<00:04:32.979> a5

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.640 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.850> that's<00:04:34.180> added<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.660> lot<00:04:34.870> more<00:04:34.930> speed<00:04:35.410> to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.800 
chip that's added a lot more speed to
things<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.039> do<00:04:36.190> every<00:04:36.220> day<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:37.180> surfing<00:04:37.660> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
things you do every day like surfing the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.200 
things you do every day like surfing the
web<00:04:37.990> sending<00:04:38.680> email<00:04:39.039> and<00:04:39.280> multitasking<00:04:40.030> in

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
web sending email and multitasking in

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.379 
web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:40.990> it's<00:04:41.320> up<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.740> twice<00:04:41.919> as<00:04:42.160> fast<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.420 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.690> we've<00:04:43.930> me<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.229> biggest<00:04:44.500> jump<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.130> with

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
place we've me the biggest jump is with

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.580 
place we've me the biggest jump is with
graphics<00:04:45.970> with<00:04:46.449> performance<00:04:47.080> that's<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.440> to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
graphics with performance that's up to

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.430 
graphics with performance that's up to
nine<00:04:47.860> times<00:04:48.220> faster<00:04:48.810> you'll<00:04:49.810> really<00:04:50.169> notice

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.710 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.979> games<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.669> apps<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.240> use<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> lot<00:04:52.510> of

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
this in games and apps that use a lot of

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.620 
this in games and apps that use a lot of
video<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.289> for<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> first<00:04:54.550> time<00:04:54.729> we<00:04:55.270> built<00:04:55.510> a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
video and for the first time we built a

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.290 
video and for the first time we built a
gyro<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.380> design<00:04:56.740> lab<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.880> gives<00:04:58.150> you

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
gyro in the design lab that gives you

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.510 
gyro in the design lab that gives you
very<00:04:58.600> precise<00:04:59.050> control<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.889> multiple

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.790 
very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.600> allows<00:05:01.840> us<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.500> really

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.159 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.580> orientation<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.510> iPad<00:05:05.020> in

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
measure the orientation of the iPad in

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.950 
measure the orientation of the iPad in
space<00:05:05.789> these<00:05:06.789> new<00:05:07.030> components<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.780> features

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
space these new components and features

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.710 
space these new components and features
add<00:05:08.440> all<00:05:08.889> kinds<00:05:08.919> of<00:05:09.490> possibilities<00:05:09.669> when<00:05:10.630> it

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
add all kinds of possibilities when it

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.170 
add all kinds of possibilities when it
comes<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.139> apps<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.650> even<00:05:12.490> though<00:05:12.610> we<00:05:12.789> boosted

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
comes to apps and even though we boosted

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.150 
comes to apps and even though we boosted
the<00:05:13.300> performance<00:05:13.900> we<00:05:14.169> haven't<00:05:14.590> compromised

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
the performance we haven't compromised

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.000 
the performance we haven't compromised
on<00:05:15.400> battery<00:05:15.820> life<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.750> new<00:05:16.930> ipad<00:05:17.440> still<00:05:17.770> gets

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
on battery life the new ipad still gets

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.190 
on battery life the new ipad still gets
a<00:05:18.130> full<00:05:18.370> 10<00:05:18.639> hours<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.570> that's<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.930> major

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
a full 10 hours and that's a major

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.620 
a full 10 hours and that's a major
achievement<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:21.039> designed<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:21.729> step<00:05:22.060> with

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
achievement and designed this step with

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.330 
achievement and designed this step with
all<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:22.930> we've<00:05:23.080> added<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.380> iPad<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:24.099> a

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
all that we've added to iPad to a

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.480 
all that we've added to iPad to a
thinner<00:05:25.030> lighter<00:05:25.450> design<00:05:25.979> amazing<00:05:26.979> dual-core

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490

a5 chip front and rear cameras and the
smart<00:05:30.970> cover<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.599> really<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.410> giant<00:05:32.710> leap

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
smart cover this really is a giant leap

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.500 
smart cover this really is a giant leap
forward

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.620 

the<00:05:36.510> original<00:05:37.050> iPad<00:05:37.550> defined<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.760> category<00:05:39.360> and

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.200 
the original iPad defined a category and
I<00:05:40.410> think<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:41.040> peg<00:05:41.340> tube<00:05:41.670> will<00:05:41.940> really

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.260 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.630> that<00:05:42.810> category<00:05:43.380> for<00:05:43.680> years<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:43.980> come
