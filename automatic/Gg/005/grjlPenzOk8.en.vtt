all right what's going on guys Joyce

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.400 
all right what's going on guys Joyce
here<00:00:04.350> again<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:05.040> first<00:00:05.850> game<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.150> went<00:00:06.390> 89<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
here again in first game I went 89 and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.009 
here again in first game I went 89 and
it<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> like<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> slower<00:00:09.420> game<00:00:09.690> than<00:00:09.870> this

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
it was a like a slower game than this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.740 
it was a like a slower game than this
this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> faster<00:00:11.040> game<00:00:11.250> play<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.690> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
this is a faster game play and I think I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.690 
this is a faster game play and I think I
go<00:00:12.900> 78<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.740> I'm<00:00:13.889> not<00:00:14.040> sure<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> score<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
go 78 for I'm not sure if the score is

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.090 
go 78 for I'm not sure if the score is
higher<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.570> game<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> used<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> me

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
higher in this game we I used to me

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500 
higher in this game we I used to me
switch<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.310> sensitivity<00:00:17.850> there<00:00:18.180> because<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
switch my sensitivity there because I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.689 
switch my sensitivity there because I

flying cap and because it counts towards

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.010

your<00:01:13.170> score<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> minute<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
your score for a minute and and just

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
your score for a minute and and just
pretty<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.560> instead<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.040> getting<00:01:17.250> three

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pretty much instead of getting three

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.969 
pretty much instead of getting three
kills<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> jump<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.110> flag<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
kills you can jump on one flag so it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
kills you can jump on one flag so it
counts<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.460> three<00:01:20.670> kills<00:01:21.080> 150<00:01:22.080> points

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
counts as like three kills 150 points

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.179 
counts as like three kills 150 points
you<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.650> 50<00:01:22.979> kills<00:01:23.189> per<00:01:23.340> point<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:24.270> kills

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
you get 50 kills per point three kills

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
you get 50 kills per point three kills
but<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.369> mind<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.939> mw3<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:28.229> I

but your mind is really can mw3 when I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
but your mind is really can mw3 when I
take<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> time<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.460> game<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.350> like

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
take the time I like my game to go like

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.039 
take the time I like my game to go like
solo<00:01:32.610> cap<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> couple<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> flags<00:01:33.479> usually<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
solo cap a couple of flags usually like

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
solo cap a couple of flags usually like
I<00:01:34.140> said<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.439> five<00:01:34.740> characters<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.490> game<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I said I get five characters for game so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.550 
I said I get five characters for game so
in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> timeline<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.409> be

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in the timeline like I'm I could be

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.990 
in the timeline like I'm I could be
capturing<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.280> flags<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.670> could<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.909> out

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
capturing those flags that could be out

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
capturing those flags that could be out
there<00:01:39.030> getting<00:01:39.210> kills<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
there getting kills you know I think it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
there getting kills you know I think it
benefits<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:42.600> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
benefits me more because you get like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
benefits me more because you get like
more<00:01:43.649> score<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.220> grabbing<00:01:44.520> flags<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.000> flight

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
more score for grabbing flags one flight

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
more score for grabbing flags one flight

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
like I said three kills so usually when

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.840 
like I said three kills so usually when
i<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.060> 5<00:01:48.509> flake<00:01:48.840> apps<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> game<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.850> 15

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
i get 5 flake apps a game that's 15
kills<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.659> i<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.590> rich<00:01:52.829> probably<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.399> maybe

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
kills so i have rich probably like maybe

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.950 
kills so i have rich probably like maybe
like<00:01:54.299> 50<00:01:54.750> kills<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.470> game<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.520> domination<00:01:56.960> 4216

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
