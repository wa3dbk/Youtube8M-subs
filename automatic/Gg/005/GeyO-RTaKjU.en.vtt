00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.720
 novum 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.559
 one of the larger ones we are going to be a bit finished with around 40 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.559
 the throne 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.699
 just once 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.699
 for that we of course have it 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.050
 the second half of 2010 to distract earlier it is a fact that when one 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.919
 pub with extinction is threatened by outsourcing takes effect 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.819
 4 the watermark 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.630
 writes the ad 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.990
 turning olaf 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.430
 4 among the women went the intel 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 of course 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 in the treaties it is true 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.790
 also extended he is 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 about the future of the former foreman 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680
 nothing so far 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800
 via a press release 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 with an exaggeration 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 rapporteur 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.720
 dismiss all points the home team 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.260
 what i further 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.000
 but beyond 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 is undoubtedly being prosecuted 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130
 then follow 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.320
 accept 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.900
 that's for me but also 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 van der v 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.550
 that was true in the eyes 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.870
