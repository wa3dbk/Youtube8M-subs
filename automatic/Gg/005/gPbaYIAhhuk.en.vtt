so this is our first section that we're
going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> take<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.340> what's<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.519> happen

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
going to take and what's going to happen

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.030 
going to take and what's going to happen
from<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.180> we're<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:17.690> work<00:03:18.040> vertically

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
from that we're going to work vertically

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.660 
from that we're going to work vertically
across<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.580> head<00:03:19.730> shape<00:03:21.190> over<00:03:22.190> directing

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
across the head shape over directing

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.509 
across the head shape over directing
everything<00:03:23.120> back<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.170> original<00:03:24.519> section

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
everything back to that original section

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.070 
everything back to that original section
that<00:03:25.909> we're<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> do<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.780> have<00:03:26.959> to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that we're going to do so you have to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.479 
that we're going to do so you have to
take<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.650> little<00:03:27.920> bit<00:03:28.099> shorter<00:03:28.430> because

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
take it a little bit shorter because

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.819 
take it a little bit shorter because
it's<00:03:28.760> only<00:03:28.909> going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.209> gradually<00:03:29.870> get<00:03:30.470> longer

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
it's only going to gradually get longer

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.399 
it's only going to gradually get longer
as<00:03:31.280> we<00:03:31.819> as<00:03:32.269> we<00:03:32.299> progress<00:03:32.629> through<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.170> Hat

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
as we as we progress through the Hat

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.410 
as we as we progress through the Hat
okay<00:03:34.159> obviously<00:03:34.790> there's<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.239> bit

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
okay obviously there's going to be a bit

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.149 
okay obviously there's going to be a bit
of<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.569> disconnection<00:03:36.110> here<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:36.799> don't<00:03:36.920> want

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
of a disconnection here you don't want

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.009 
of a disconnection here you don't want
too<00:03:37.400> much<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.849> this<00:03:37.970> disconnection<00:03:38.780> in

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
too much of it this disconnection in

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.319 
too much of it this disconnection in
this<00:03:39.200> area<00:03:39.560> take<00:03:40.129> it<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.310> bit<00:03:40.340> shorter<00:03:40.909> you<00:03:41.090> know

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
this area take it a bit shorter you know

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
every kid's head is going to be

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.530 
every kid's head is going to be
different<00:03:42.680> just<00:03:43.400> like<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.549> regular<00:03:44.000> client<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
different just like a regular client the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.420 
different just like a regular client the
angle<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.079> I'm<00:03:48.230> cutting<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.799> that<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.250> can

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
angle that I'm cutting it that that can

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.970 
angle that I'm cutting it that that can
vary<00:03:49.730> as<00:03:49.970> well<00:03:50.239> if<00:03:50.629> you<00:03:50.750> wanted<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.170> little<00:03:51.769> bit

and<00:05:37.360> take<00:05:37.660> some<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.020> this<00:05:38.250> perimeter<00:05:39.960> guys

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
and take some of this perimeter guys

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.400 
and take some of this perimeter guys
we're<00:05:41.260> just<00:05:41.410> going<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.620> point<00:05:41.920> cut<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:43.410> now

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
we're just going to point cut that now

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.830 
we're just going to point cut that now
we're<00:05:44.590> going<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.770> do<00:05:44.950> is<00:05:45.160> just<00:05:45.400> simply<00:05:45.840> over

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:09.550 

bring<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.760> down<00:05:59.820> boom

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.900 

put<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.590> bit<00:06:10.770> of<00:06:10.800> hat<00:06:11.070> through<00:06:11.370> here<00:06:11.550> just<00:06:11.580> want

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
point cut there's a little bit of Wax

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.770 
point cut there's a little bit of Wax
cool<00:06:26.240> all<00:06:27.240> right<00:06:27.270> so<00:06:27.600> there<00:06:27.780> you<00:06:27.870> have<00:06:27.930> it<00:06:28.260> a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
cool all right so there you have it a

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.230 
cool all right so there you have it a
disconnected<00:06:30.920> asymmetric<00:06:31.920> undercut<00:06:32.550> on<00:06:33.180> a

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
disconnected asymmetric undercut on a

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.720 
disconnected asymmetric undercut on a
two<00:06:33.510> year<00:06:33.690> old
