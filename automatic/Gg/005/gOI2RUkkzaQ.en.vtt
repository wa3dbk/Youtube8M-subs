fives and if you got all the same number

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.069 
fives and if you got all the same number
that's<00:01:27.659> Yahtzee<00:01:28.759> okay<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that's Yahtzee okay but it so I did it

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.149 
that's Yahtzee okay but it so I did it
so<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> add<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.759> 5<00:01:33.000> times<00:01:33.439> 5<00:01:34.439> times<00:01:34.500> 4<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
so I can add what 5 times 5 times 4 is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.069 
so I can add what 5 times 5 times 4 is
20<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> fives<00:01:37.409> column<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
20 so you go to the fives column and

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.429 
20 so you go to the fives column and
then<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.500> write<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.909> right<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.439> 20

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
then you would write it right there 20

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.130 
then you would write it right there 20
so<00:01:43.710> we've<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.040> 20<00:01:44.220> points<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.850> far<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so we've got 20 points so far and you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.770 
so we've got 20 points so far and you
would<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> rest<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.939> like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
would do that with the rest and see like

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.399 
would do that with the rest and see like
if<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:50.060> two<00:01:51.060> ones<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.049> two<00:01:52.229> times

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
if I have two ones I would do two times

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
if I have two ones I would do two times
one<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.329> two

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
one which is two so I would have got two

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.340 
one which is two so I would have got two
points<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> same<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> rest

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
points and do the same with the rest

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.050 
points and do the same with the rest
three<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.939> would<00:01:59.939> be<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:01.040> if<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.790> had

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
three of a kind would be like if I had

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.459 
three of a kind would be like if I had
that

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.499 
that
that<00:02:05.979> would<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.249> three<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.729> kind<00:02:06.759> four<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.420> a

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
that would be three of a kind four of a

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.839 
that would be three of a kind four of a
kind<00:02:07.780> would<00:02:08.709> be<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:11.410> that's<00:02:12.330> full<00:02:13.330> house

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
kind would be like that's full house

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:26.250 
kind would be like that's full house
would<00:02:15.849> be<00:02:23.879> well<00:02:24.879> if<00:02:25.060> three<00:02:25.629> of<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.840> kind<00:02:25.870> you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
would be well if three of a kind you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.170 
would be well if three of a kind you
would<00:02:26.410> forfeit<00:02:27.340> I'm<00:02:27.489> gonna<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.060> then

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
would forfeit I'm gonna be that and then

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.119 
would forfeit I'm gonna be that and then
you<00:02:28.269> add<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.660> up<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.290> equals<00:02:29.739> twenty

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
you add that up with that equals twenty

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.130 
you add that up with that equals twenty
three<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.879> a<00:02:30.970> kind<00:02:31.000> will<00:02:31.330> be<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.959> that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
three of a kind will be that so that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.940 
three of a kind will be that so that
would<00:02:32.290> equal<00:02:32.709> 15<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.120> full<00:02:34.450> house<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
would equal 15 and then full house you

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.839 
would equal 15 and then full house you
could<00:02:36.190> full<00:02:36.730> house<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.269> really<00:02:37.660> where<00:02:38.849> you

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
could full house is really where you

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.289 
could full house is really where you
just<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:42.030> two<00:02:45.000> nope

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
just go one two nope

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.900 
just go one two nope
yeah<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:49.019> forgot<00:02:50.019> what<00:02:50.200> full<00:02:50.379> house<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.829> but<00:02:51.129> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
yeah I forgot what full house is but a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.750 
yeah I forgot what full house is but a
small<00:02:52.360> straight<00:02:52.870> would<00:02:53.049> be<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.470> two<00:02:53.920> three

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150 

and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.660> large<00:02:58.930> state<00:02:59.260> would<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.590> one<00:02:59.829> two

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
and then a large state would be one two

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.000 
and then a large state would be one two
three<00:03:02.099> four<00:03:03.099> so<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:05.440> Yahtzee<00:03:05.890> are

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
three four so like that then Yahtzee are

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.849 
three four so like that then Yahtzee are
all<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.280> same<00:03:06.459> numbers<00:03:06.879> then<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> chance<00:03:07.859> you

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
all the same numbers then a chance you

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.479 
all the same numbers then a chance you
just<00:03:09.160> add<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:10.269> just<00:03:10.540> say<00:03:11.139> if<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.349> got<00:03:11.470> off<00:03:11.739> all

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
just add you just say if you got off all

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.170 
just add you just say if you got off all
fives<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.950> then<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.880> would<00:03:16.030> add

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
fives and one for then you would add

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.750 
fives and one for then you would add
five<00:03:16.540> times<00:03:16.840> four<00:03:17.139> and<00:03:17.170> 20<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:18.040> would<00:03:18.609> do

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
five times four and 20 so you would do

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.599 
five times four and 20 so you would do
20<00:03:19.239> points<00:03:19.569> then<00:03:20.109> at<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.500> end<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:21.130> add<00:03:21.310> up<00:03:21.489> all

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
20 points then at the end you add up all

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.569 
20 points then at the end you add up all
your<00:03:21.700> points<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.510> get<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.109> grand<00:03:23.889> total<00:03:24.400> so

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
your points and get the grand total so

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.390 
your points and get the grand total so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you put the top section right there

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.240 
you put the top section right there
lower<00:03:28.269> section<00:03:28.750> right<00:03:28.870> there<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.889> total

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
lower section right there and the total

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.870 
lower section right there and the total
and<00:03:30.780> most<00:03:31.780> people<00:03:32.200> win<00:03:32.410> by<00:03:33.370> thanks<00:03:33.760> for
