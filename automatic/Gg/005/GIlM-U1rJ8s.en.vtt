00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.110
 if you talk 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.110
 first there is the stress that brings us to 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.420
 depression if you do not fight if you are strong 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.070
 leads to self-destruction and I started 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.919
 writing is because the body asked me to 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.989
 What would it be like for me if this did not exist? 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.029
 I know what will be of my tears in each 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.309
 secret aspect inconfesables between the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.110
 pen and notebook I do not write you rhythm 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.610
 I even write feelings if not that 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.379
 write sad is that I never write 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.820
 concerts I remember that night 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.920
 sending it we were cold 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 we have spent a lot of time we have learned 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.420
 now we are smarter at heart 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.820
 tanned that take away what I love I do not 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.250
 they take away the lived ones I have 20 years of 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.440
 Shit experiences almost do not fit me 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.110
 adolescence promise you can grow it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.540
 beat and make you strong eyes know the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.850
 war that I maintain internally almost 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.070

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.989
