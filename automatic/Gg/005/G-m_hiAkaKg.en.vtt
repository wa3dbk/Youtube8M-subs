00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
I have for the CES was it kind of looks

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
I have for the CES was it kind of looks
like<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.340> EES<00:01:41.700> isn't<00:01:42.030> necessarily<00:01:42.450> where

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
like this EES isn't necessarily where

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
like this EES isn't necessarily where
all<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.649> big<00:01:43.950> first<00:01:44.369> announcers

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
all of the really big first announcers

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
all of the really big first announcers
are<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> come<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:45.869> perfectly

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
are going to come but that's perfectly

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.690 
are going to come but that's perfectly
fine<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
fine because what we're going to see is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
fine because what we're going to see is
like<00:01:47.939> me<00:01:48.180> zoo<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.600> my<00:01:49.049> zoo<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.560> haven't<00:01:50.159> figured

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
like me zoo or my zoo we haven't figured

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.630 
like me zoo or my zoo we haven't figured
that<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.549> yet

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
that out yet

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.940 
that out yet
is<00:01:52.450> like<00:01:52.690> my<00:01:52.870> zoo<00:01:53.110> where<00:01:53.320> they're<00:01:53.590> they're

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is like my zoo where they're they're

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
is like my zoo where they're they're
creating<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.370> phone<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.820> yes<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.210> doesn't

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
creating a phone that yes it doesn't

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.520 
creating a phone that yes it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:55.479> innovate<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:56.290> they're<00:01:56.409> doing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
necessarily innovate but they're doing

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.680 
necessarily innovate but they're doing
it<00:01:56.740> correctly<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.060> valuable<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.630> and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
it correctly and that is valuable in and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.450 
it correctly and that is valuable in and
of<00:01:58.870> itself<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.710> that's<00:01:59.830> a<00:01:59.920> lot<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.130> what<00:02:00.340> we're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460
