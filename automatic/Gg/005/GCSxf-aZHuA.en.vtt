to<00:03:13.980> last<00:03:14.519> season<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.959> did<00:03:16.320> finish<00:03:16.560> strong<00:03:16.890> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to last season we did finish strong I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
to last season we did finish strong I
think<00:03:17.190> coming<00:03:17.370> into<00:03:17.720> two<00:03:18.720> year<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.200> there's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
think coming into two year to there's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.130 
think coming into two year to there's
you<00:03:20.220> know<00:03:20.310> greater<00:03:20.579> expectations<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.079> know

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
you know greater expectations you know

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.750 
you know greater expectations you know
higher<00:03:22.620> goals<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.489> that's<00:03:23.640> really

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
higher goals and I think that's really

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220 
higher goals and I think that's really
what<00:03:23.970> we're<00:03:24.060> working<00:03:24.180> towards<00:03:24.540> right<00:03:24.690> now<00:03:24.810> we

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
what we're working towards right now we

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.110 
what we're working towards right now we
have<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> confident<00:03:25.980> group<00:03:26.070> they<00:03:26.730> feel<00:03:26.970> good

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
have a confident group they feel good

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.900 
have a confident group they feel good
about<00:03:27.180> themselves<00:03:28.070> they've<00:03:29.070> worked<00:03:29.280> hard<00:03:29.430> and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
about themselves they've worked hard and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.880 
about themselves they've worked hard and
I<00:03:30.390> think<00:03:30.630> we<00:03:30.780> can<00:03:30.930> carry<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.230> confidence

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
I think we can carry that confidence

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.860 
I think we can carry that confidence
into<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> season<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.720> be

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
into the season and I think we can be

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870 
into the season and I think we can be
consistently<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.590> good<00:03:34.920> group<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.640> entire

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
consistently a good group for the entire

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.640 
consistently a good group for the entire
year<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.989> think<00:03:37.140> it's<00:03:37.260> going<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.440> take<00:03:37.620> a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
year I don't think it's going to take a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.680 
year I don't think it's going to take a
