00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:17.710
 it was this forms the grand finale of the wm-year 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 Here decides whether the work of the winemaker over the year 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.970
 were successful 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.880
 However, an unaffected Barça factor for the quality of the grapes is the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.110
 natural weather conditions 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.410
 a rainy autumn can ruin the hard work of a whole year 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.860
 do 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.540
 and so we hope every year for a golden sonic in the fall 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.850
 Due to our diversity of varieties, the grape harvest already starts in the middle of the year 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.260
 September and can be years in which we hope for an ice wine 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 to last into the winter 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.810
 and to produce top-quality wines, it is essential in the vintage to it 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.310
 Make sure that only healthy and ripe grapes are read 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.560
 the courage these grapes have the full aroma and the desired sugar content 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.550
 immature grapes from stay on the stick and become later 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.080
 read 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 Falling below the different qualities requires accuracy and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.750
 a lot of tact 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.980
 Ben 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.010
 especially with the red wine liese it is very important that only fully 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.180
 Dyed and ripe grapes are read to drive at a maximum and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630
 To reach taste yield 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.930
 because the red dyes are not in the bear but said in the BI 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 Scheuerle included 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 The grapes you read will go to the winery as soon as possible 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.790
 brought to them there quickly and gently to process so the valuable 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 Aromas are preserved 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.920
 First, the grapes are tipped onto a vibrating alert tape and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.420
 again sorted to remove last leaves and bad grapes 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:21.170
 Via the conveyor the grapes reach the work BA machine 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.549
 where they are separated from the style 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.349
 This happens so Scheunemann that we mostly whole and only a little 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.039
 damaged the bear received 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.509
 this mixture of bears and juice 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.309
 Menz man mash 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:40.180
 to maintain quality during the acceptance process on any 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.179
 Points up to good Liese waived 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.719
 Now the production process of red and white wine separates 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:57.029
 the white wines mash is tilted after a lifetime in the press and the 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.649
 Juice squeezed 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.619
 the length of the service life is taken care of and quality depends 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.509
 The juice runs Ryan over gravity and without pumping 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.509
 gently in the lower cellar 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:19.189
 the red wines mash, however, is dumped in the Air »TANs and there on the 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.279
 Mash fermented 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.509
 this is necessary because during fermentation the colors and flavors as well as 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:31.239
 Tannins are released from the bear's skin and the kernels and the first 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 looking for a red wine can emerge 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.239
 One would like with the red wine mash like tenant white wine mash process so 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.189
 you would get a white wine from red grapes a blue one 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.919
 After completing the mainstream around he will finish in front of Bora Millions leg 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.939
 further processing in the cellar drained 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.099
 great wines from 6 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.599
 Winery also concludes then Bergh
