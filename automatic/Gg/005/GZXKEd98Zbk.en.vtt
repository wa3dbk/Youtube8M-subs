inside<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.830> spool<00:01:06.070> here<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.140> cast<00:01:08.410> control

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
inside the spool here is a cast control

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.420 
inside the spool here is a cast control
system<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:10.210> has<00:01:10.450> spool<00:01:11.050> actuators<00:01:11.830> on<00:01:12.010> the

inside of the spool here and this
braking<00:01:15.310> system<00:01:15.640> will<00:01:15.790> allow<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.710> have

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
braking system will allow you to have

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.100 
braking system will allow you to have
the<00:01:17.860> brakes<00:01:18.240> function<00:01:19.240> when<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.690> need<00:01:19.900> them

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the brakes function when you need them

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.200 
the brakes function when you need them
but<00:01:20.800> if<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:21.010> don't<00:01:21.310> really<00:01:21.520> need<00:01:21.670> them<00:01:21.850> say

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
but if you don't really need them say

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.420 
but if you don't really need them say
for<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.480> short<00:01:22.750> pitch<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:24.070> know<00:01:24.160> cover

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
for a short pitch just you know cover

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.880 
for a short pitch just you know cover
that's<00:01:25.420> real<00:01:25.660> close<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:26.020> proximity<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.530> you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
that's real close in proximity to you

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.710 
that's real close in proximity to you
you're<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.880> have<00:01:27.970> super<00:01:28.360> free<00:01:28.570> you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
you're going to have super free you

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.750 
you're going to have super free you
don't<00:01:29.020> need<00:01:29.350> brake<00:01:29.800> weights<00:01:30.040> or<00:01:30.190> friction<00:01:30.400> at

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
don't need brake weights or friction at

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.330 
don't need brake weights or friction at
all<00:01:31.210> now<00:01:31.780> let's<00:01:32.110> say<00:01:32.230> fish<00:01:32.710> your<00:01:32.860> schooling<00:01:33.220> up

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
all now let's say fish your schooling up

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.920 
all now let's say fish your schooling up
about<00:01:33.550> 50<00:01:33.940> yards<00:01:34.060> away<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.540> rule<00:01:34.750> will<00:01:34.810> be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
about 50 yards away this rule will be

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.210 
about 50 yards away this rule will be
able<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.080> get<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.620> closely<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.130> you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
able to get you to it closely so you

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.280 
able to get you to it closely so you
make<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:36.580> cast<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.240> that's<00:01:37.660> when<00:01:38.050> your

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
make that cast and that's when your

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.360 
make that cast and that's when your
break<00:01:38.500> which<00:01:38.710> are<00:01:38.830> going<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.040> come<00:01:39.220> into

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
break which are going to come into

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.370 
break which are going to come into
effect<00:01:39.870> under<00:01:40.870> extreme<00:01:41.820> rpm<00:01:42.820> highest<00:01:43.600> rpm<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
effect under extreme rpm highest rpm the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.500 
effect under extreme rpm highest rpm the
actuators<00:01:44.920> kick<00:01:45.160> in<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.640> move<00:01:45.910> that<00:01:46.120> braking

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
actuators kick in and move that braking

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.240 
actuators kick in and move that braking
system<00:01:46.840> into<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.050> braking<00:01:47.500> ring<00:01:47.710> which<00:01:48.100> is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
system into the braking ring which is

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.470 
system into the braking ring which is
when<00:01:48.460> you're<00:01:48.610> going<00:01:48.760> to<00:01:48.820> need<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.180> cast

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
when you're going to need that cast

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.500 
when you're going to need that cast
control<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.590> work<00:01:50.800> properly<00:01:51.130> reduce<00:01:52.000> backlash

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
control to work properly reduce backlash

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.480 
control to work properly reduce backlash
so<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.930> fish<00:01:53.200> hits<00:01:53.500> your<00:01:53.710> bait<00:01:53.920> as<00:01:54.100> soon<00:01:54.340> as

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
so if the fish hits your bait as soon as

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.190 
so if the fish hits your bait as soon as
it<00:01:54.610> hits<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.850> water<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.690> don't<00:01:55.840> have<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> pick

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
it hits the water you don't have to pick

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.870 
it hits the water you don't have to pick
