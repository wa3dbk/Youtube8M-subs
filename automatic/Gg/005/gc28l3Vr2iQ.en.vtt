like proper animation is difficult
time-consuming<00:01:50.990> requires<00:01:51.990> dedication<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
time-consuming requires dedication I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.539 
time-consuming requires dedication I
don't<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.880> any<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> those<00:01:54.270> things

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
don't have any of those things

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.850

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
so if stuff like this is more like sort

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859
