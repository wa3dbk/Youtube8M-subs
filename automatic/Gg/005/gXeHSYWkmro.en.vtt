00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
actually do believe it or not the JSL

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.289 
actually do believe it or not the JSL
connection<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.430> whatever<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:21.060> is

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
connection and whatever this is

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.270 
connection and whatever this is
they<00:03:21.930> it'll<00:03:22.290> it'll<00:03:22.500> plug<00:03:22.709> together<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
they it'll it'll plug together and it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.420 
they it'll it'll plug together and it
work<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:26.450> back<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.690> car<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.950> steering's

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
work so back to the car the steering's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.620 
work so back to the car the steering's
pretty<00:03:29.730> nice<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.260> good<00:03:31.799> um<00:03:32.730> one

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
pretty nice it's really good um one

pretty nice it's really good um one
thing<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.870> recommend<00:03:34.380> though<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.709> right<00:03:35.700> here

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
thing I recommend though is right here

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.440 
thing I recommend though is right here
that<00:03:36.570> ball<00:03:36.840> linkage<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.459> right<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:39.060> linkage

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
that ball linkage and right that linkage

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.720 
that ball linkage and right that linkage
right<00:03:39.630> there<00:03:40.040> there's<00:03:41.040> some<00:03:41.190> slop<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.580> them

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
right there there's some slop in them

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.250 
right there there's some slop in them
which<00:03:42.180> isn't<00:03:42.420> good<00:03:42.750> when<00:03:42.959> you're<00:03:43.110> running

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
which isn't good when you're running

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.770 
which isn't good when you're running
around<00:03:43.580> 20<00:03:44.580> miles<00:03:44.760> per<00:03:44.850> hour<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.150> your<00:03:45.420> cards

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
around 20 miles per hour and your cards

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.710 
around 20 miles per hour and your cards
decides<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.500> turn<00:03:46.620> randomly<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.720> that's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
decides to turn randomly and that's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.340 
decides to turn randomly and that's
solvable<00:03:49.230> too<00:03:50.330> on<00:03:51.330> eBay<00:03:51.780> I've<00:03:51.930> seen<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.290> before

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
solvable too on eBay I've seen it before

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.340 
solvable too on eBay I've seen it before
for<00:03:52.830> 10<00:03:53.010> bucks<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.549> get<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.630> bar<00:03:54.959> which

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
for 10 bucks you can get a bar which

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.990 
for 10 bucks you can get a bar which
connect<00:03:55.680> essentially<00:03:56.400> connect<00:03:56.670> these<00:03:56.790> two

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
connect essentially connect these two

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.509 
connect essentially connect these two
together<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.660> there's<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.530> eliminate<00:03:59.100> all<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
together so there's it eliminate all the

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.449 
together so there's it eliminate all the
slop<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:01.709> ways<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:02.250> car

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
slop you have and that ways your car

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.740 
slop you have and that ways your car
just<00:04:02.670> won't<00:04:02.850> go<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.239> random<00:04:03.540> unpredictable

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
just won't go in a random unpredictable

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.430 
just won't go in a random unpredictable
way<00:04:04.910> also<00:04:05.910> about<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.330> gears<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:06.930> here<00:04:07.110> as<00:04:07.380> I

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
way also about the gears right here as I

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.490 
way also about the gears right here as I
mentioned<00:04:07.830> earlier<00:04:08.400> they<00:04:09.090> also<00:04:09.360> saw<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> gear

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
mentioned earlier they also saw a gear

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
mentioned earlier they also saw a gear
cover<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.299> which<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.450> thought<00:04:12.630> was

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
cover for this which I thought was

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.750 
cover for this which I thought was
pretty<00:04:13.019> nice<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.440> them<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:13.860> I'm<00:04:14.160> not<00:04:14.430> gonna<00:04:14.549> go

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.500 
yeah so four wheel drive aluminum shaft
even<00:04:41.520> though<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.640> don't<00:04:41.880> think<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.150> can<00:04:42.270> see

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.410 
even though I don't think you can see
that<00:04:42.690> aluminum<00:04:43.410> shaft<00:04:44.840> ball<00:04:45.840> differentials

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
that aluminum shaft ball differentials

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.040 
that aluminum shaft ball differentials
and<00:04:48.830> yeah<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:51.410> um<00:04:53.300> about<00:04:54.300> running<00:04:54.870> this

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
and yeah so um about running this

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.580 
and yeah so um about running this
earlier<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.770> was<00:04:56.130> using<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.790> combination

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
earlier I was using this combination

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
earlier I was using this combination
this<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:59.070> eight<00:04:59.520> hundred<00:04:59.910> eight<00:05:00.120> thousand

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
this is it eight hundred eight thousand

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.480 
this is it eight hundred eight thousand
nine<00:05:00.660> hundred<00:05:01.200> kv<00:05:02.100> motor<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.100> way<00:05:05.280> less

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
nine hundred kv motor this is way less

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.310 
nine hundred kv motor this is way less
it's<00:05:05.880> almost<00:05:06.210> equivalent<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.960> mom<00:05:07.170> at

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
it's almost equivalent to the mom at

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.920 
it's almost equivalent to the mom at
nine<00:05:07.470> thousand<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:09.540> only<00:05:09.750> main

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
nine thousand and the only main

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.460 
nine thousand and the only main
difference<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.410> 100<00:05:11.370> cavies<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:12.200> this<00:05:13.200> cost

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
difference is 100 cavies and this cost

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.290 
difference is 100 cavies and this cost
is<00:05:13.590> about<00:05:13.740> $80<00:05:14.460> less<00:05:15.440> this<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.830> 3<00:05:17.400> cell<00:05:17.610> 1000

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
is about $80 less this is a 3 cell 1000

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.020 
is about $80 less this is a 3 cell 1000
I<00:05:18.360> was<00:05:18.540> running<00:05:18.900> with<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.820> speed

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
I was running with this and the speed

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.800 
I was running with this and the speed

control right there and pretty much this

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.950 
control right there and pretty much this
set<00:05:25.050> up<00:05:25.230> for<00:05:25.410> about<00:05:25.530> 80<00:05:25.770> bucks<00:05:26.330> will<00:05:27.330> make<00:05:27.540> your
