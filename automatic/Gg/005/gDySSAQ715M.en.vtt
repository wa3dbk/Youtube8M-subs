that<00:02:48.300> was<00:02:48.450> unique<00:02:49.170> about<00:02:49.379> what<00:02:50.040> I've

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that was unique about what I've

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
that was unique about what I've
installed<00:02:50.610> there<00:02:50.910> I've<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.270> camera<00:02:51.569> here

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
installed there I've got a camera here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.000 
installed there I've got a camera here
and<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.230> shows<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.680> back<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.190> boot

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.440 

but<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> rest<00:02:57.879> right<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
but I'm going to rest right in the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.210 
but I'm going to rest right in the
v-groove<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.319> made<00:02:59.590> for<00:02:59.860> our<00:03:00.010> tile

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
v-groove that we made for our tile

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.160 
v-groove that we made for our tile
connection<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.510> now<00:03:01.659> I'm<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:02.140> to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
connection and now I'm just going to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.570 
connection and now I'm just going to
watch<00:03:02.379> that<00:03:02.409> till<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.250> just

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.720 

there<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.390> right<00:03:07.570> on<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> bottom<00:03:08.550> now<00:03:09.550> we're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
there it's right on the bottom now we're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.980 
there it's right on the bottom now we're
gonna<00:03:09.850> hit<00:03:10.060> lay<00:03:10.270> mode

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
gonna hit lay mode

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.350 
gonna hit lay mode
now<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:12.950> calculated<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> entire<00:03:14.060> line

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
now it just calculated the entire line

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.040 
now it just calculated the entire line
that<00:03:14.600> we're<00:03:14.720> gonna<00:03:14.840> install

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
that we're gonna install

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.460 
that we're gonna install
that's<00:03:17.440> gonna<00:03:17.650> maintain<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:19.300> optimum<00:03:20.200> depth

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that's gonna maintain it optimum depth

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:30.390 
that's gonna maintain it optimum depth
that<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.800> asked<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.280> to

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430 

now<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.000> really<00:03:31.239> unique<00:03:31.540> thing<00:03:31.989> about<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
now the really unique thing about the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.820 
now the really unique thing about the
wolf<00:03:32.650> parallel<00:03:33.220> leg<00:03:33.400> plow<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:35.379> look<00:03:35.590> here

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
wolf parallel leg plow is you look here

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.640 
wolf parallel leg plow is you look here
we've<00:03:36.069> got<00:03:36.220> slope<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.819> 307<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.170> slope<00:03:38.440> on

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
we've got slope of 307 and the slope on

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.280 
we've got slope of 307 and the slope on
the<00:03:38.799> attitude<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.519> 307<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.629> whatever<00:03:41.019> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
the attitude is 307 so whatever the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.250 
the attitude is 307 so whatever the
slope<00:03:41.560> changes<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:43.150> attitude<00:03:43.330> cylinders

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
slope changes the attitude cylinders

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.380 
slope changes the attitude cylinders
were<00:03:44.409> matched<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:45.069> same<00:03:45.459> slope<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
were matched that same slope the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.970 
were matched that same slope the
advantage<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.680> as<00:03:50.680> we're

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
advantage to that is is that as we're

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.890 
advantage to that is is that as we're
tiling<00:03:51.489> we've<00:03:51.640> always<00:03:51.849> got<00:03:52.150> back<00:03:52.180> pressure<00:03:52.690> on

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
tiling we've always got back pressure on

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.630 
tiling we've always got back pressure on
the<00:03:53.049> back<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.560> boot<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.220> we're<00:03:54.340> always

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
the back of that boot and we're always

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520 
the back of that boot and we're always
cutting<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.329> groove<00:03:55.569> for<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.930> tile<00:03:56.260> that's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
cutting the groove for that tile that's

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.339 
cutting the groove for that tile that's
super<00:03:56.950> important

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
super important

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.110 
super important
another<00:03:58.680> big<00:03:58.890> advantage<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.670> when<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
another big advantage is when the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.110 
another big advantage is when the
machine<00:04:00.269> breaks<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.989> other<00:04:01.110> way<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
machine breaks the other way the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.330 
machine breaks the other way the
attitude<00:04:03.629> of<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.959> plow<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.230> very<00:04:04.829> point<00:04:05.099> of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
attitude of the plow the very point of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.849 
attitude of the plow the very point of
the<00:04:05.459> plow<00:04:05.670> would<00:04:06.000> never<00:04:06.239> get<00:04:06.510> higher<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:07.170> lower

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
the plow would never get higher or lower

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.429 
the plow would never get higher or lower
than<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.310> back<00:04:08.489> end<00:04:08.819> if<00:04:09.719> it<00:04:09.900> did<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.260> we'd

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
than the back end if it did that we'd

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.140 
than the back end if it did that we'd
have<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> hump<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:11.010> our<00:04:11.129> tile<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.640> attitude

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
have a hump on our tile the attitude

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.229 
have a hump on our tile the attitude
keeps<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:12.719> point<00:04:13.019> always<00:04:13.379> up<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.670> positive

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
keeps that point always up in a positive

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.740 
keeps that point always up in a positive
mode<00:04:16.489> that's<00:04:17.489> what<00:04:17.729> makes<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.120> paralleling

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
mode that's what makes the paralleling

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.449 
mode that's what makes the paralleling
plow<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.229> feel<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> best<00:04:19.859> plow<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.489> world

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
plow I feel the best plow in the world

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.129 
plow I feel the best plow in the world
to<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.150> best<00:04:22.180> job<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.930> possibly<00:04:23.500> do

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.170 

so<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.889> see<00:04:28.069> we're<00:04:28.250> maintaining<00:04:28.490> three

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
so you can see we're maintaining three

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.470 
so you can see we're maintaining three
and<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> half<00:04:29.419> foot<00:04:29.689> deep

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.050 

sloper<00:04:35.320> running<00:04:35.650> at<00:04:35.770> about<00:04:35.890> four<00:04:36.370> seven<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
sloper running at about four seven and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.300 
sloper running at about four seven and
then<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.330> 3:06<00:04:37.990> box<00:04:38.290> that's<00:04:38.590> where<00:04:38.800> running

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
then the 3:06 box that's where running

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.790 
then the 3:06 box that's where running
also
