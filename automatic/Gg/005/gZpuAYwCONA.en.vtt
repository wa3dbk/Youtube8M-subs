00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
few different steps that cover a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.819 
few different steps that cover a
powerful<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.270> first<00:01:00.540> step<00:01:00.810> is<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.500> simple

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
powerful the first step is just a simple

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
powerful the first step is just a simple
approach<00:01:02.220> so<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.060> you<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.720> you

the starting position I want to sink in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
the starting position I want to sink in
and<00:01:20.400> settle<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.479> my<00:01:21.630> position<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.979> raising

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and settle into my position by raising

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.180 
and settle into my position by raising
my<00:01:23.580> chest<00:01:23.940> flattening<00:01:24.690> my<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:25.190> spreading

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
my wrist I want to roll my wrist forward

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.460 
my wrist I want to roll my wrist forward
just<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.710> bit

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
just a little bit

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.020 
just a little bit
the<00:01:32.680> reason<00:01:32.950> why<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.220> roll<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.550> wrist<00:01:33.760> forward

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the reason why we roll the wrist forward

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.450 
the reason why we roll the wrist forward
so<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.810> you're<00:01:35.110> not<00:01:35.140> jerking<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.010> way<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
so that you're not jerking the way and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.670 
so that you're not jerking the way and
getting<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.880> bend<00:01:37.150> which<00:01:37.630> will<00:01:37.810> then<00:01:37.990> actually

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
getting to bend which will then actually

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.320 
getting to bend which will then actually
have<00:01:39.250> your<00:01:39.430> shoulders<00:01:39.790> come<00:01:39.970> up<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.240> you'll

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
have your shoulders come up and you'll

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.610 
have your shoulders come up and you'll
be<00:01:40.360> lifting<00:01:40.750> with<00:01:40.870> your<00:01:40.900> back<00:01:41.200> instead<00:01:41.500> of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
be lifting with your back instead of

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.890 
be lifting with your back instead of
your<00:01:41.800> legs<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.240> there's<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.510> couple<00:01:43.660> different

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
your legs so there's a couple different

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.600 
your legs so there's a couple different
phases<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.710> power<00:01:44.920> clean<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.460> want

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
phases in the power clean that you want

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.610 
phases in the power clean that you want
to<00:01:45.640> be<00:01:45.700> aware<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.660> first<00:01:46.930> phase<00:01:47.200> which

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
to be aware of the first phase which

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.130 
to be aware of the first phase which
called<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.280> first<00:01:48.550> pull<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.270> that's<00:01:49.720> simply

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
called the first pull and that's simply

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.530 
called the first pull and that's simply
just<00:01:50.350> lifting<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.010> barbell<00:01:51.400> up<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:52.000> about<00:01:52.240> mid

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
just lifting the barbell up to about mid

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.200 
just lifting the barbell up to about mid
me<00:01:52.720> height<00:01:52.990> okay<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.640> again<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.150> you're

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
me height okay now again that you're

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.730 
me height okay now again that you're
going<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.450> incorporate<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:56.170> all<00:01:56.380> into<00:01:56.500> one

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
going to incorporate this all into one

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.870 
going to incorporate this all into one
movement<00:01:57.010> but<00:01:57.250> I'm<00:01:57.370> going<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.580> go<00:01:57.700> through

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
movement but I'm going to go through

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.340 
movement but I'm going to go through
each<00:01:57.940> of<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.360> steps<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.960> can<00:01:59.080> actually

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
each of the steps that you can actually

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.690 
each of the steps that you can actually

see exactly what you should be doing

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.230 
see exactly what you should be doing
during<00:02:01.510> every<00:02:01.780> single<00:02:02.020> phase<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.470> power<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
during every single phase the power the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.219 
during every single phase the power the
approach<00:02:04.800> step<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:07.390> here<00:02:07.660> when<00:02:08.080> you're
