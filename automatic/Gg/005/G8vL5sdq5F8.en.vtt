00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.520
 i am taylor i am paying you active and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.980
 to the heartbreaking questions about gta 5 what we are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.410
 we are waiting for the game to be announced 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.149
 note 18 of the hummer like me seems a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 very varied because I could also 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.010
 the fact of being able to play in others 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.489
 games are many you can throw grave 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.379
 tell faresud a feature 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.200
 present in other sites open e 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.630
 this time it will surely be something 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 of epic because I saw that already said 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.770
 there is also the deep of mountain 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.590
 bike at random but tanning play 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.230
 tennis and sick inside zebra around the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 incredix even if there is practically no or 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.510
 compact gta 5 matches playing tennis 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 you can do parachuting you can do 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.519
 supermodel and shoot you can analyzed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.369
 for free media company because we know 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.439
 all that gta 5 si gta knows what a difference 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.390
 because it is not necessary between a mission 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.000
 to calenzano the apparent city because 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 at the end 16 michael a story you want 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 the story of gta 5 1 follows we are 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 clearly to play it to play it between then 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.520
 let's say we talk because you go youtube 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.560
 and a road takes a road 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.740
 commission but against evil between the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.869
 fact that we search where it escapes 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.270
 never fails to do the mission in the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.740
 searching started but surely there 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 graphic and site improvements will be 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.259
 also by the traders who see themselves taken 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.049
 on the shoulders it looks like a through a game 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.539
 which will mark another star lantern era 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.219
 production costs were also seen 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.689
 been really high but when he speaks 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.060
 in such shall all the money collapse 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.489
 presale instead really good that 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.349
 make you use between the characters yes 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.500
 suonarsi is an innovative thing 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.950
 see about respect to any other 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 game 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.709
 let's say if people to the person of the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 its there are three you can also change 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.410
 instantly with a vision of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.090
 google earnings tourists opened 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.040
 going milan song decision makers to 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 sounds that have other characteristics 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 different 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.340
 what we will do when we touch the disc 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.150
 names that were beautiful 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.270
 consul 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.850
 the first thing we do is say is 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.320
 surely then I take and cassino for 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.020
 a safe car first thinks that 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.410
 everyone gave it close to the first thing 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.300
 as to steal stealing to steal go of 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.890
 backup the capital it makes to make a 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.120
 around the city all things fall 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.040
 that you can do without 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.870
 I do n't really know how to do everything but 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.300
 at least at the beginning, we can see it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.280
 then find the three characters as much 6 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.990
 see if at the moment how big is the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.600
 deduction map per race and one thing 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.250
 huge if then and then after playing 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.860
 less so than not having done either 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.160
 the profession will go on to try 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.650
 immediately multiplayer yes even though 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.220
 however, they were no different any more 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.470
 two hours 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.660
 I would certainly go on to see things 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.440
 that you don't find we are made up of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.410
 this site 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.610
 there's a whole but may act as super 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.980
 final is after I will go into multiplayer and 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.540
 they buy or steal what they don't at home 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
 I know we see it was better to steal it 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.380
 khamis I will sing at his son's house because 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.560
 multiplayer guys I remind you that ai 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.570
 16 players so you can play of 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.600
 six months alessandro do not know what you will have to 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.180
 do 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.740
 Our qualities are genuinely traders 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.340
 I've seen less of these on the right 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.630
 what the girl really also has 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 bought titles guys like them 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.350
 buy some light country house then 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:10.590
 definitely around the map and then 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:13.290
 multiplayer the last question was on 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.400
 before social salt we are in ruin 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.110
 but with this game 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.060
 we'll go sabrina because we had out 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.540
 so many more images written about my life 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.330
 between end when going straight to 5 is 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.620
 probable 5 really estimate a lot 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.740
 he realized it is not like the territory 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.930
 of sweets because they define it as background 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.490
 but all to a world that advances much 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.020
 single player which will involve for that 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.640
 you could do all these things 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.740
 mayer has established what I repeat but in 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.610
 multiplayer now speaks of aosta 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.919
 multiplayer to while not 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.810
 I don't know anyway I think that 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:55.979
 someone remains almost anyway 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.180
 would have if you had to choose between 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.310
 Siro good multiplayer really not 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.840
 I would know downstream on Android however according to 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.180
 me multiplayer if it's not fun anymore 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.969
 lasts because you play with other people ad 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.250
 friends if you do n't make it the first one you are 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.389
 so what to say in my opinion points to those 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.270
 accents you will have something more 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.360
 fun to memorize the progress made 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.189
 in the game we also find them well say 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.349
 if I go back to exact then spiro I think 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.139
 that playing more with the mood is true but not 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.020
 for this I will not finish the single 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.590
 player at least once then in video 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.319
 it's over 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.199
 we hope that gt5 respects 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.110
 the expectation is correct and we will see everything 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.789
 on 17th September hi Neapolitan boys 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.789
 next video from the next hello
