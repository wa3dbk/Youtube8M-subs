the standard glueless full lace wig so
you<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.440> part<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.770> anywhere<00:02:52.190> because<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.790> is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
you can part it anywhere because it is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.020

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
full lace it has two cones on the side a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.630 
full lace it has two cones on the side a
comb<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.870> middle<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.860> always<00:02:58.220> take

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
comb in the middle that I always take

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.610 
comb in the middle that I always take
out<00:02:58.850> because<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.240> never<00:02:59.570> ever<00:02:59.810> used<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.260> comment

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
out because I never ever used a comment

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.200 
out because I never ever used a comment
at<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.800> top<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.130> my<00:03:01.220> head<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.820> just<00:03:01.910> think

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
at the top of my head like I just think

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.140 
at the top of my head like I just think
that's<00:03:02.330> odd<00:03:02.660> placement<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.250> always<00:03:04.790> take

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
that's odd placement so I always take

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.940 
that's odd placement so I always take
that<00:03:05.300> comb<00:03:05.540> out<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.020> then<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.230> does<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
that comb out and then it does have the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.510 
that comb out and then it does have the
adjustable<00:03:07.820> straps<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> back<00:03:08.570> so<00:03:09.520> yeah

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
adjustable straps in the back so yeah

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.479 
adjustable straps in the back so yeah
this<00:03:10.850> week<00:03:11.150> y'all<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.680> business<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.370> think

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
this week y'all is the business I think

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.220 
this week y'all is the business I think
it's<00:03:13.820> awesome<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.270> I<00:03:14.360> think<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> length

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
it's awesome and I think that the length

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.110 
it's awesome and I think that the length
obviously<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:16.250> what<00:03:16.430> makes<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.850> look<00:03:17.060> so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
obviously is what makes it look so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.840 
obviously is what makes it look so
realistic<00:03:17.930> because<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:19.220> know<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:19.640> all

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
realistic because you know it's not all

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.150 
realistic because you know it's not all
the<00:03:20.000> way<00:03:20.090> down<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.510> my<00:03:20.630> butt<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.230> things<00:03:21.890> like

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.860 
that
nothing<00:03:22.790> nothing<00:03:23.239> wrong<00:03:23.390> with<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.660> hair

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
as realistic as it could look if I had

or<00:03:57.530> brown<00:03:57.859> stocking<00:03:58.609> cap<00:03:58.849> so<00:03:59.269> this<00:04:00.109> is<00:04:00.319> what<00:04:00.469> it

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
has said what unit is there is what we

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.099 
has said what unit is there is what we
get<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.609> everybody<00:04:11.150> assumes<00:04:11.599> that<00:04:11.719> it's<00:04:11.959> my

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
get is everybody assumes that it's my

hair and never even want posted the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.520 
hair and never even want posted the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
feedback was and so far everybody thinks

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.529 
feedback was and so far everybody thinks
that<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:19.039> mine<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.669> thank<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.180> if<00:04:20.449> you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
thought it was mine but it's actually a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.290

if you do plan on purchasing it the link
that<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.770> 14<00:04:37.130> inches<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.580> I'm<00:04:37.639> five

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
that I have is 14 inches and I'm five

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.020 
that I have is 14 inches and I'm five
three<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.810> quarter<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.860> I'm<00:04:40.220> sure<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.849> this

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
three and a quarter so I'm sure and this

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.629 
three and a quarter so I'm sure and this
is<00:04:41.180> where<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.479> falls<00:04:41.750> on<00:04:42.020> me<00:04:42.289> as<00:04:42.949> far<00:04:43.340> as<00:04:43.490> the

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
is where it falls on me as far as the

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.210 
is where it falls on me as far as the
density<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.900> guys<00:04:45.050> know<00:04:45.259> that<00:04:45.289> normally<00:04:45.949> I

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
density you guys know that normally I

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.589 
density you guys know that normally I
always<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.699> something<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.030> say<00:04:47.210> about<00:04:47.240> our

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
always have something to say about our

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.450 
always have something to say about our
PC<00:04:47.960> show<00:04:48.139> density<00:04:48.650> because<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.009> feel<00:04:49.220> like

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
PC show density because I feel like

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.520 
PC show density because I feel like
they're<00:04:49.789> thinner<00:04:50.180> than<00:04:50.660> what<00:04:50.900> they<00:04:51.020> should<00:04:51.050> be

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
they're thinner than what they should be

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.129 
they're thinner than what they should be
which<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.220> can<00:04:52.490> get<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.300> know<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.990> get

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
which you can get you know you can get

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.350 
which you can get you know you can get
any<00:04:54.320> custom<00:04:54.740> made<00:04:54.949> to<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.699> density<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
any custom made to the density that you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.450 
any custom made to the density that you
prefer<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.169> if<00:04:57.259> you<00:04:57.380> get<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.560> spot<00:04:57.830> wig<00:04:58.099> it's

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
prefer but if you get a spot wig it's

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.010 
prefer but if you get a spot wig it's
going<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.759> be<00:04:58.880> like<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.389> think<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.870> hundred

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
going to be like I think a hundred

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.480 
going to be like I think a hundred
percent<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:01.300> because<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.539> unit<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.490> shorter

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
percent and because this unit is shorter

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.580 
percent and because this unit is shorter
the<00:05:05.030> density<00:05:05.479> doesn't<00:05:05.750> bother<00:05:06.020> me<00:05:06.199> at<00:05:06.440> all

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
the density doesn't bother me at all

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.680 
the density doesn't bother me at all
because<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.159> also<00:05:07.400> makes<00:05:07.789> it<00:05:07.940> look<00:05:08.180> more

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
because it also makes it look more

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.930 
because it also makes it look more
realistic<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.460> density<00:05:10.729> is

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
realistic so I think that the density is

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.510 
realistic so I think that the density is
perfect<00:05:11.599> on<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.380> unit<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.220> fact<00:05:13.460> that

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
perfect on this unit and the fact that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.060 
perfect on this unit and the fact that
it's<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:13.940> Yacky<00:05:14.479> texture<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.320> seriously<00:05:15.889> looks

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
it's a Yacky texture it seriously looks

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.460 
it's a Yacky texture it seriously looks
like<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.639> just<00:05:16.729> got<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.180> relaxer<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:17.990> looks<00:05:18.260> like

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
like I just got a relaxer it looks like

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.439 
like I just got a relaxer it looks like
I<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:18.680> stepped<00:05:19.190> on<00:05:19.370> somebody's<00:05:19.909> new<00:05:20.120> salon

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
I just stepped on somebody's new salon

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.170 
I just stepped on somebody's new salon
chair<00:05:20.780> because<00:05:21.320> that's<00:05:21.979> how<00:05:22.190> sleek<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:23.150> is

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
chair because that's how sleek it is

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.540 
chair because that's how sleek it is
either<00:05:23.810> was<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.229> being<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.590> Yacky<00:05:24.919> texture

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
either was it being a Yacky texture

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.480 
either was it being a Yacky texture
there's<00:05:26.120> absolutely<00:05:26.720> no<00:05:27.050> tangling<00:05:27.800> at<00:05:28.220> all

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
there's absolutely no tangling at all

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.920 
there's absolutely no tangling at all
the<00:05:29.419> shedding<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.990> very<00:05:30.349> very<00:05:30.620> minimal<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.669> I

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
the shedding it's very very minimal so I

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.149 
the shedding it's very very minimal so I
definitely<00:05:32.930> recommend<00:05:33.229> this<00:05:33.440> week<00:05:33.740> out<00:05:34.039> of

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
definitely recommend this week out of

definitely recommend this week out of
all<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.490> units<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.940> I've<00:05:35.060> had<00:05:35.240> from<00:05:35.360> our<00:05:35.539> PG
