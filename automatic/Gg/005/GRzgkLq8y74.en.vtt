finish in a few days time send off to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
finish in a few days time send off to
cert<00:00:51.660> testing<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> didn't<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.590> sir

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
cert testing and if you didn't know sir

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
business days so you have to exclude the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.080 
business days so you have to exclude the
weekends<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.460> completed

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it to search testing and if it takes the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.440

maximum 10 business days and comes back
we<00:01:09.659> could<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> looking<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.439> halfway<00:01:11.070> through

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
we could be looking at halfway through

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.179 
we could be looking at halfway through
august<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> release<00:01:12.570> date<00:01:13.070> but<00:01:14.070> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
august as the release date but then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
august as the release date but then
again<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.390> even<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.960> accepted

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
again if it doesn't even get accepted

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
again if it doesn't even get accepted
for<00:01:16.740> cert<00:01:16.920> testing<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.670> fails<00:01:17.909> cert

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
for cert testing like if it fails cert

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
for cert testing like if it fails cert
testing<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.860> through<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
testing they have to look through it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940 
testing they have to look through it
again<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> fix<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> bugs<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.590> send<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.680> over

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
again and fix the bugs and send it over

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
again and fix the bugs and send it over
to<00:01:22.979> set<00:01:23.280> testing<00:01:23.580> again<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.150> i<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:25.200> hope

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to set testing again so i really hope

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.539 
to set testing again so i really hope
that<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.830> happen<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> would

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that doesn't happen because it would

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
that doesn't happen because it would
mean<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.630> most<00:01:28.170> likely<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.560> come

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
mean that it would most likely not come

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.069 
mean that it would most likely not come
out<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> august<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.759> i'm<00:01:30.750> pretty<00:01:30.960> sure

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
out in august but i'm pretty sure

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
out in august but i'm pretty sure
they've<00:01:31.590> been<00:01:31.770> bug<00:01:31.979> fixing<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.460> quite<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
they've been bug fixing it for quite a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
they've been bug fixing it for quite a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
while now just two hundred percent make

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
for when the game actually does come out

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.859 
for when the game actually does come out
because<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:38.970> obviously<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.659> like

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
yeah guys it's pretty much it they're

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
yeah guys it's pretty much it they're
still<00:01:47.159> bug<00:01:47.340> fixing<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.420> i'm<00:01:48.689> not

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
still bug fixing the game so i'm not

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
still bug fixing the game so i'm not
really<00:01:48.869> sure<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.590> they're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.189> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
really sure if they're going to be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.149 
really sure if they're going to be
telling<00:01:50.579> us<00:01:50.670> any<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.090> info<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> moment

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
telling us any more info at the moment

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.080 
telling us any more info at the moment
because<00:01:53.159> obviously<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.759> even<00:01:54.000> know

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
because obviously they don't even know

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
because obviously they don't even know
when<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> release<00:01:54.600> date<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.810> coming<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.560> going

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
when the release date is coming is going

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
when the release date is coming is going
to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.130> yet<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.700> obviously<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.210> still

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to be yet because obviously they still

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.440 
to be yet because obviously they still
need<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> send<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> cert<00:01:58.469> testing<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.450> other

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
need to send it to cert testing so other

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120 
need to send it to cert testing so other
than<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> i'm<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.439> sure<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.920> can't

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
than that i'm not really sure they can't

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.580 
than that i'm not really sure they can't
really<00:02:02.250> tell<00:02:02.520> us<00:02:02.549> anything<00:02:02.670> else<00:02:03.030> because

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
really tell us anything else because

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.719 
really tell us anything else because
that<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.799> doesn't<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.520> there's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that there doesn't look like there's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
that there doesn't look like there's
going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.060> any<00:02:06.149> features<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.170> obviously

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
going to be any features and obviously

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
going to be any features and obviously
the<00:02:07.770> multiplayer<00:02:08.310> isn't<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.849> much

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the multiplayer isn't going to be much

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210 
the multiplayer isn't going to be much
different<00:02:09.660> apart<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.050> bigger<00:02:10.289> world<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.890> in

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
different apart from bigger world so in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.610 
different apart from bigger world so in
all<00:02:12.120> honesty<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:12.989> didn't<00:02:13.200> really<00:02:13.410> have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
all honesty that they didn't really have

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.130 
all honesty that they didn't really have
anything<00:02:13.920> else<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> tell<00:02:14.489> us<00:02:14.640> apart<00:02:14.849> from<00:02:15.360> when

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
anything else to tell us apart from when

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110
