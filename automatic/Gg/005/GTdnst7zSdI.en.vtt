00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 welcome to cr fotos.de in today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.569
 video I want you a bit 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 my experiences and impressions here to 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.870
 tell wacom intus 52 graphics tablet 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 I 've been here for a while 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 graphics tablet in used though had 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.859
 also a vacuum and this little one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 pennant touch and now I have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.779
 thoughtfully I climb here on this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 important info 54 above with the whole 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 buttons and I will also do some 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 more videos also do the same 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 whole sets then on the computer the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 whole system settings and what you can 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.870
 of course in Photoshop 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.610
 can start 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
 but in this video I would like to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 Show what's included 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 the whole comes this box and everything 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.700
 in there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.489
 there are after the intro you see i have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 most of it already unpacked and that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.489
 most important here for sure 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 tablet we'll see you soon 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.190
 is on 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 I like to show you something else 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 is included of course included 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 a pen and i have to say that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 physically a little less 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.540
 and is better in the hand than the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.619
 founder of the canon touch 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.610
 So I have the feeling that somehow 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.530
 it's a bit better here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.939
 so balanced is definitely 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.750
 important is if you use the pen 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.790
 is working 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.420
 and just like the other pen has 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.830
 also the two buttons on the side 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.229
 and of course an eraser too 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.689
 if you like that at the top 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 but these are all these functions 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.869
 of course freely assignable 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.560
 I'll show you that in the next one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.610
 video how to set it all 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 Also included is this beautiful 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.780
 pen holder we can pen so 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.340
 just put it in or you can get it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 put it on top too 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 that is extra notch but because 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.340
 I find it much more interesting 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.009
 that's what it hides 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.200
 more brush tips or pen 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.649
 There are tips that have such a 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.259
 small are a little feather on it 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.920
 so something softer we also have something 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.600
 harder and some even do not know what 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 but this is a material for everyone 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 case different pen tips already 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.020
 with it for those of you 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.330
 that too 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.550
 then really paint with this tray 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.320
 certainly a great thing that it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.170
 everything is supplied with a pen 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.620
 Touch was not there here it was 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.050
 not with you 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.120
 here is this usb cable that 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.340
 I just put it in here then 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.550
 Just put it in here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 and then the whole thing about mini usb or 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.670
 connected to the computer with usb and me 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.320
 can work with the tablet what 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.090
 did not surprise what I am so 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.120
 order did not know that is 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.250
 fact that here also a usb dongle 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 it is and has the opposite to it 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.090
 I already used here I show you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:59.450
 that just for a minute that's here 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.300
 down in the floor once in there we have 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.390
 here is the battery that is up here and here 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.040
 sits the counterpart to the usb dongle and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.160
 now just gives me the opportunity 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.160
 that the tablet also completely without 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.370
 can use without cable 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.440
 speak wirelessly and I think the battery 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.580
 I did not really know it yet 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.380
 try the time 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.490
 he keeps a whole while and that 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.750
 Of course, then nice if you 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.660
 You do not necessarily have to travel 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.140
 I haul the cable but I know 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.060
 make my hommel in the calculator and 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.840
 you are at the side and can 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.830
 then work with this tablet 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.630
 Also included with this tablet 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.100
 do they still have such 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.070
 individualization rings to make the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.540
 are here for find in the pen 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.640
 I am very interesting when you are with 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.230
 several people together is the same 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.150
 all have this tablet or that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.930
 same pen and you can get that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 Mark here a bit 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.110
 otherwise it was already 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 with what is included here it is 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.110
 Of course there is also a cd and 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.540
 instructions which is ekd are on the cd 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.340
 all drivers and 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.590
 programs he needs I would you 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.900
 but recommend going on vakuums 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.880
 website and invite you 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.709
 current version of the now 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.940
 everyone was at that was unfortunately not the 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.610
 Latest here come to the tablet and there 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.259
 I would like to know what to say like 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.370
 said the attitude then show up 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.740
 in extra video 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.240
 you have now with this small version 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.139
 there is one middle and one whole 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.639
 big version 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.539
 I have to say the little one is enough for 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.030
 absolutely no problem at all 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.280
 there are here six hot keys express the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.470
 can prove itself free at 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.599
 calculator in the system settings can 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.280
 tell her exactly what to do with this program 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.830
 this button will do the following 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.919
 There are endless possibilities 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.380
 I'll show you everything and you have 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:04.720
 here a middle a click wheel as well as 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:08.110
 maybe it knows from the ipod touch of 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.289
 earlier ipod ipod 1 it was, I think 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.259
 clicked a click wheel here 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.820
 Show the four can occupy their free 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.560
 So you click through the function 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.210
 if you are on the right side for 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.400
 For example, at xoom we can go through 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.440
 Just turn that around to achieve that 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.250
 picture then just wanted in or out 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.130
 is the area which he for disposal 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.250
 So they really have to work 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:37.120
 your pen here it reacts 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.530
 marked by such four corners and you 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.060
 you have to imagine that desire 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.610
 complete screen in his 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.550
 resolution on this surface 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.680
 is projected, the surface of the tablets 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.780
 is a bit bigger but really 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.190
 the work surface that marks it here 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.090
 with these countries you can too 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.370
 still change 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.680
 So not necessarily one 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.240
 one copy because there are two 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.919
 you either leave different modes 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.729
 this whole screen on it 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.120
 project 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.919
 So now that I have here but he has 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.300
 almost exactly the same area as above 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.490
 that is if you are here with the pen 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.009
 top right corner is then you are 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.970
 also put on the screen to the right 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.130
 pen down 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.070
 the mouse also jumps and gives 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.229
 another mode you have to quasi 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.560
 Push the mouse but I'll show you 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.260
 as I said in the text 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.710
 otherwise there is not really video 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.380
 much to say about this tablet the whole 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.240
 costs 180 euro I have the link 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.130
 to the tablet times the video describe 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.080
 Packed in if you like the product 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.270
 interested and now to lay down 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.770
 want to click above and my link below 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.320
 the video description then supported 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.520
 you are me with your purchase one 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.650
 Maybe I'll still do that to you 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.780
 can tell that is the whole 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.830
 of course also sensitive to pressure 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.919
 that means as hard as you press on like that 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.110
 becomes strong then for example also the 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.410
 Brush stroke higher there are many 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.940
 gradings and you can also do this 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.889
 hardness in the exact set 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.139
 attitudes and strong wears 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.860
 and in certain strength 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.190
 accusation to reach it 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:15.440
 In addition, the tablet supports your 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.690
 pen attitude so depending on how you 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.720
 hold the pen whether you paint like this or 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.320
 just as all this plays a role and 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.979
 will 1 1 then on the computer in 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.919
 photoshop eg implemented so far 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.840
 to overview what you get 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:35.120
 if ye here as a vacuum inside them 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.400
 five trays I'm on each 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.070
 I really just like the fall case 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.780
 a little better than the pen touch 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.580
 and if you still know now 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.890
 want how to set the whole and 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.300
 how to work with it in photoshop then 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.640
 subscribe to the channel in any case 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.680
 right here under me then you get 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.750
 that directly with and here have a page 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.940
 I'll give you two more videos just now 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.729
 linked the upper bed I show you how 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.490
 in photoshop a splatter look 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:04.490
 generated and in the bottom video I show 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.979
 you have a speed processing of a 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.479
 Portraits in photoshop should be on everyone 

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.650
 Let's take a look 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.840
 So I 'm glad if you when 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.490
 Next video then be there thanks 

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.490
 for watching what is good and expensive
