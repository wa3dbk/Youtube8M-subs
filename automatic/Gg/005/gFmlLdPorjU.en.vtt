00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.110
 lighting scolding somehow I'm in the open spaces 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 internet stumbled upon the way that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.570
 It says that we are a pint read this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.890
 I became a question damn how to grind 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.379

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.860

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.260
 a spoon of panty thread for every 10 is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:04.229
 It turns out a liter of water and three cats screw 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:13.740
 such a device here is a drill stud and iron 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.760
 any frieze that you calmly pass 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 the neck of the can is a matter of fact 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.720
