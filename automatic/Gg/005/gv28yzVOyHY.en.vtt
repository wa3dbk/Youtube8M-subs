mode usually armed systems don't have
addressed<00:00:24.689> enough<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> created<00:00:25.680> this

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
addressed enough but I created this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
learned about the rest the direst code

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
learned about the rest the direst code
the<00:00:30.179> direst<00:00:30.539> code<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> trap<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> burglar

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the direst code is a trap with a burglar

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
the direst code is a trap with a burglar

circle<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> were<00:01:39.780> seeing<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.409> trying

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
circle you were seeing that I was trying

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.370 
circle you were seeing that I was trying
to<00:01:40.920> appear<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> timer<00:01:41.970> circle<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.020> if

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to appear it's the timer circle so if

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.010 
to appear it's the timer circle so if
the<00:01:43.500> full<00:01:43.710> shook<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.729> full<00:01:45.030> circle<00:01:45.630> shows

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the full shook if the full circle shows

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
the full shook if the full circle shows
then<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.710> means<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.220> alarm<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.790> armed<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
then that means the alarm is armed and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.319 
then that means the alarm is armed and
when<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.290> away<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.310> real<00:01:50.460> life<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.909> you

when I away this is for real life if you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
when I away this is for real life if you
don't<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:52.229> exit<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.820> exit<00:01:54.210> the
