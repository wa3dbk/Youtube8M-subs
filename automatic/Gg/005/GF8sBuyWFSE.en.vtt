00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.440
 so love people and there is already 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.539
 solemnly welcome 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.580
 in guild wars 2 out and drk are here 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.580
 with the really fat broke at the start 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.399
 I would like to say something but that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.980
 It is so breathtaking that I am 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.489
 now just this story here 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.489
 would like to show 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 look where we can attack or 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.159
 are even smaller than make the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.090
 We definitely times equal dead 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.409
 but there are so many people here too 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.409
 that is not a problem is the center 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.830
 I did not have to say anything to you or 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.310
 We come here to pose the crystal 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.659
 lump 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.399
 to which we have did in any case 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:58.090
 do the way it looks because he is right now 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.770
 a trance state as you see behind 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.789
 we also have siege weapons 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.789
 they help 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.630
 a daily updated 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 the question is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.940
 now 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.349
 we close the target 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.670
 fire free again I am trying 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 I catch that a little bit 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.510
 a damage is not so relevant here 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.510
 with level 50 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.660
 get a bird out of it as well 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.440
 there are so many players here that we 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.440
 be very hard 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.090
 an organ 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.950
 sony more much just barely out 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 10 as you see her now fast 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
 worn 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.090
 okay that means again 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.379
 OK 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.379
 once again 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.590
 ok death he is not but a huge party 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:14.370
 tool is there and everyone wants to load it 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.370
 then we'll see what's inside 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.630
 I have a lot of good living there 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.769
 I'll take a closer look 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.550
 more quickly 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:30.699
 what came out but knicks green is just 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.350
 unfortunately a strong thing along blue things 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.340
 trident hire the definitely 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.199
 use immediately but otherwise relative 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.830
 mau could be a bit more but 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.610
 I alone believe the event itself 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.900
 wash worth seeing at the place 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.910
 contact us as we said 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.770
 Play goes two on the server 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.520
 Riverside riverside are still looking 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.660
 people for our instances et cetera with 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.539
 our community with our guild 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.310
 start together on amazon.de 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.710
 simply rheine the community and are 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.760
 then I would say your baby and we 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.110
 Now go to the next instance and 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.949
 watch if we need local too 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.949
 until then look
