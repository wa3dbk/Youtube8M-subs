so<00:02:04.080> when<00:02:04.320> she<00:02:04.470> gets<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.800> usually<00:02:05.130> scribe<00:02:05.400> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so when she gets that usually scribe to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.070 
so when she gets that usually scribe to
him<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.850> he's<00:02:05.970> bad<00:02:06.270> player<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:06.750> me<00:02:06.900> but

him because he's bad player than me but

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.000 
him because he's bad player than me but
that's<00:02:07.200> probably<00:02:07.380> cuz<00:02:07.560> he's<00:02:07.680> got<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.830> bad

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
that's probably cuz he's got a bad

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.710
