with this j-style kayak carrier it's
going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> allow<00:00:42.270> us<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.510> simply<00:00:43.469> displace<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
going to allow us to simply displace the

so<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> install<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.890> we'll<00:00:50.070> simply<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
so to install it we'll simply need to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
so to install it we'll simply need to
take<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:50.969> some<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.300> our<00:00:51.390> hardware<00:00:51.780> we'll<00:00:52.500> need

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
take out some of our hardware we'll need

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.090 
take out some of our hardware we'll need
two<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.699> black<00:00:54.030> bolts<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.770> then<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
two of these black bolts and then one of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
two of these black bolts and then one of
the<00:00:56.250> rubber-coated<00:00:56.640> black<00:00:57.149> brackets<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the rubber-coated black brackets and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
the rubber-coated black brackets and
we'll<00:00:58.890> need<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.370> black<00:01:00.030> wing<00:01:00.239> nut<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
we'll need the black wing nut which is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.939 
we'll need the black wing nut which is
going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> secure<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> bracket<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> bar

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
going to secure the bracket to the bar

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
going to secure the bracket to the bar
so<00:01:02.579> we'll<00:01:02.699> start<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.030> by<00:01:03.090> taking<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so we'll start off by taking one of the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.570 
so we'll start off by taking one of the
bolts<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.430> through<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.390> square<00:01:06.869> hole

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
bolts and going through the square hole

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
bolts and going through the square hole
here<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> steel<00:01:09.570> tube<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.409> you'll<00:01:10.560> notice

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
here on the steel tube now you'll notice

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.760 
here on the steel tube now you'll notice
there's<00:01:11.100> two<00:01:11.159> holes<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.290> are<00:01:13.290> not

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
there's two holes here which are not

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
there's two holes here which are not
designed<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> bolts<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.330> through<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
designed for the bolts to go through it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.030 
designed for the bolts to go through it
is<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.590> square<00:01:17.189> holes<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.030> bar

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
is the square holes that are in the bar

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.149 
is the square holes that are in the bar
so<00:01:20.040> we'll<00:01:20.189> slide<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> bolt<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:22.159> then

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so we'll slide the bolt through then

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
so we'll slide the bolt through then
we'll<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> bracket<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> underside

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we'll take the bracket on the underside

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
we'll take the bracket on the underside
and<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> start<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.630> hole<00:01:27.869> not

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and I'm going to start with the hole not

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.590 
and I'm going to start with the hole not
the<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.680> slot<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.329> now<00:01:30.329> we'll<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.570> ahead

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the little slot here now we'll go ahead

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
the little slot here now we'll go ahead
and<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> slide<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.439> bracket<00:01:31.650> over<00:01:31.950> onto

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and just slide the bracket over onto

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
and just slide the bracket over onto
that<00:01:33.180> downward<00:01:34.020> bolt<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.299> using

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that downward bolt now if you are using

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230 
that downward bolt now if you are using
the<00:01:37.229> thule<00:01:37.799> aeroblades<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.549> may<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the thule aeroblades it may be kind of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.289 
the thule aeroblades it may be kind of
difficult<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
difficult to get this on because the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
difficult to get this on because the
wing<00:01:42.479> nuts<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> very

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
wing nuts have to be right at the very

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.789 
wing nuts have to be right at the very
end<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.210> bolt<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
end of the bolt so now we have it on

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
end of the bolt so now we have it on
we'll<00:01:49.799> simply<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.189> tighten<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.540> two

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
we'll simply just tighten down the two

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
we'll simply just tighten down the two
wing<00:01:51.720> nuts<00:01:53.240> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> making<00:01:54.540> sure<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
wing nuts kind of making sure and it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.810 
wing nuts kind of making sure and it's
equal<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> both<00:01:57.810> sides<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:59.210> allowing<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
equal on both sides just allowing the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.400 
equal on both sides just allowing the
kayak<00:02:02.820> carrier<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.330> be<00:02:03.450> touching<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:03.960> much<00:02:04.140> bar

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
kayak carrier to be touching as much bar

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
kayak carrier to be touching as much bar
as<00:02:04.590> possible

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.539
