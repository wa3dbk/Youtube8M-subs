00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.109
 Alexey but 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.680
 one of the few who participated in the art 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.900

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.470
 cars our secret world was this time 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.290
 but they say that they do not go as 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.330

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.519

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 were with 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.610
 overheating leg variators watched with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 temperature 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.460
 extremely slowly overheating me that is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 you drove cautious and cautious now 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 tuned to order that is already in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 the second stage you give fights 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.600

 now favorite rzr on the case on 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.160
 Acceleration is probably the maximum 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.229
 speed will be so far because the mainland 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:38.060
 I think that people are not completely clear here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.190
 this question went down in history 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.100
 gone down in history now so country 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.110

 no jumping broke no one lied that's all 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.819
 they say that many lost with what 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 due to the fact that it is inexperience or 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.450
 this is due to some problems 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.190
 trips and problems of course feasting 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.370
