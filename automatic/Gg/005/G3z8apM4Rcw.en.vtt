00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
 If you are an absolute amateur for the first time playing a rugby game then you are surprised 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.730
 Maybe over the crowd on the field Sa at the attachment and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.180
 cared for it is a very important game element the black beer and still 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.610
 something you absolutely must know with the hand you must not just the ball 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.089
 throw backwards 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.199
 If you can not imagine everything right now then look 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.269
 They just relaxed to us today for them both finals 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 German championship in Frankfurt 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.740
 when these hard-fought battle against body throw into the fray of a field 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.150
 immediately 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 the large number of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740
 female fans in the audience 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.430
 For example, women are about particularly large market the connoisseurs perhaps even larger 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 Rooms the experts like a lot of man 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.200
 so honest this way of oiling 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 I have 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.999
 Nani g-ba 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.820
 what is not 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.229
 more Mattia Pasini and the strong men defeated the Rhinelander 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.049
 The sport is not why they still bake so many women at the same time 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.880
 Reilly - of course - many offers 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.280
 only the most beautiful in it lies the portion of the clear words or 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.250
 Mr 16 07 clock Couples the world number 16 from the SC 18 80 Frankfurt Sun Numbers 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 16 that's what Sladen likes 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.600
 Face had to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.990
 So the 16 percent 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.220
 September 1901 was 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 in the way 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.390
 the 16 and u 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.430
 the money in their community Martin 1 out 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.040
 that means that squandered 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.650
 Manuel Thormann analyst himself civilians 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.460
 Norman Salad enlightened this man Andrew Shore as edgy said that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.070
 Immediately gets to feel the full severity of abuse of power 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.340
 Humming there, the man with the action really hurt himself 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.910
 short moment of shock 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.100
 and then 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.920
 the final for the German championship 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 in every relationship 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.860
 Defending champion Frankfurt in red-black so in front of home scenery 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.560
 to impress the opponent from Heidelberg 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 to defend the guests in blue and white 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.929
 By the way, any type of upholstery is prohibited 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.959
 the players are dressed 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.209
 for the footballers 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.069
 Every body contact litigation steamed on the bones 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.069
 Playing time twice 40 minutes the last seconds are currently running 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.629
 traumatic final 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.769
 he does not do everything this attacks must also be shot exactly over the bar 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.079
 the city of Bad Waltersdorf 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.939
 Nicola enforces the no longer considered possible extension 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.169
 not in such a way 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.039
 but then 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.579
 the hits 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.579
 everything open 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.719
 nothing with Scrum 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.359
 this time 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.359
 Heidelberg is the better team and profits after extra time earned with 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.739
 39 to 22 and there is still one winner after this high-class finale 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.219
 Today, I grew and grew and it has to go on like this 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.729
 Staying ground though, it has not flowed or concerns its duration 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.729
 but now there the Dortelweiler but Bertz 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.939
 we want to dare 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.739
 you have to accept it clouds further episode what was not difficult with this stint 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.230
 should fall
