 with a maximum of 1000 revolutions per minute according to the manufacturer 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.369
 and it breaks all very adult Bernese within 30 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 with would be per minute 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.550
 to say that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.839
 is this a black frame 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.990
 the fan blades and the rotor 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 so would be kept in its design 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.469
 this is going on throughout 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.469
 quite harmonious 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.550
 So it's the workmanship well 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.110

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 Schopper volume of Christ 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.120
 and 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.320
 a big market - just a span of 9 to 10 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.350
 unlike so many times before 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 Zeller like that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 if at all only under construction 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 Percent is also not really fast with his just over 300 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 ours per minute 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 Bilger after a pole by cool thing 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.570
 it's just an easy son to take Beau 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.070
 Thus, the fan is definitely suitable for PC lines 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 Another could read according to the test report 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.239
