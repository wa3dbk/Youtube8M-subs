00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
nice and tight and it gives you a loop

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.550 
nice and tight and it gives you a loop
that<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.630> shows<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.990> that<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.320> your

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you see there pull this portion down

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.989 
you see there pull this portion down
over<00:01:20.609> the<00:01:20.729> middle<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.149> nut<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.999> then

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999

you're gonna fold on top of that then if
you<00:01:29.490> turn<00:01:29.759> sideways<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.630> pull<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.859> will<00:01:32.039> see

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
you turn sideways and pull you will see

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.279 
you turn sideways and pull you will see
that<00:01:32.549> hole<00:01:32.819> is<00:01:33.389> where<00:01:33.569> you're<00:01:33.719> going<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:33.990> force

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
that hole is where you're going to force

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.569 
that hole is where you're going to force
the<00:01:34.889> back<00:01:35.189> end<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.880> bowtie<00:01:36.359> through<00:01:36.689> okay

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
the back end of this bowtie through okay

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:57.310 
the back end of this bowtie through okay
so<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:39.539> we<00:01:39.689> go

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.640 

I<00:01:58.150> like<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.300> straighten<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.870> middle<00:02:00.200> out<00:02:00.350> some

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
I like to straighten the middle out some

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.010 
I like to straighten the middle out some
people<00:02:00.830> like<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.190> leave<00:02:01.370> it<00:02:01.550> all<00:02:01.670> crinkly<00:02:02.090> but

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
people like to leave it all crinkly but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.260 
people like to leave it all crinkly but
I<00:02:03.320> guess<00:02:04.220> that's<00:02:04.430> why<00:02:04.550> I'm<00:02:04.610> too<00:02:04.730> square<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.030> like

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
I guess that's why I'm too square I like

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:14.500 
I guess that's why I'm too square I like
to<00:02:05.390> look<00:02:05.540> nice<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.020> neat<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.230> everything<00:02:13.510> all

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
to look nice and neat and everything all

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.810 
to look nice and neat and everything all
right<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.960> once<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.710> this<00:02:15.920> point<00:02:16.160> this

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
right so once you get to this point this

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.000 
right so once you get to this point this
is<00:02:17.060> when<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:18.200> start<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> play<00:02:18.740> with<00:02:18.770> it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
is when you can start to play with it

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.690 
is when you can start to play with it
and<00:02:20.440> manipulate<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.190> pull<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.520> loop

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and manipulate it if you pull the loop

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970 
and manipulate it if you pull the loop
ends<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.300> night<00:02:23.480> or<00:02:23.660> get<00:02:23.870> tighter<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
ends of the night or get tighter if you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.530 
ends of the night or get tighter if you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
pull the free ends of the night it'll

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.200 
pull the free ends of the night it'll
get<00:02:26.750> looser<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:28.430> keep<00:02:28.610> playing<00:02:28.820> with<00:02:28.970> it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
get looser and just keep playing with it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.840 
get looser and just keep playing with it
back<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.600> forth<00:02:29.840> until<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.280> as

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
back and forth until you get it as

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.300 
back and forth until you get it as
symmetrical<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.860> not<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.250> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
symmetrical as you can it's not going to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.760 
symmetrical as you can it's not going to
be<00:02:34.430> perfect<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.840> character<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
be perfect that is the character of the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.850 
be perfect that is the character of the
bowtie<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.490> talked<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> post

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
bowtie that I talked about in the post

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.199 
bowtie that I talked about in the post
but<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.370> couple<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.760> times<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
but you do this a couple of times and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:57.740 
but you do this a couple of times and
you'll<00:02:41.330> tie<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.570> bowtie<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:42.230> you're<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> pro

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.790 

so<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.890> how<00:02:59.070> a<00:03:00.320> self-taught<00:03:01.320> bowtie

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
so that is how a self-taught bowtie

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
so that is how a self-taught bowtie
should<00:03:02.070> look<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.690> has<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.080> lot<00:03:04.380> of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
should look as you can see has a lot of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.390 
should look as you can see has a lot of
character<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.320> nice<00:03:07.470> blazer<00:03:07.830> or
