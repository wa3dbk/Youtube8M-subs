corners<00:00:34.449> well<00:00:35.449> that's<00:00:35.629> a<00:00:35.750> corner<00:00:36.260> cutting

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
corners well that's a corner cutting

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.810 
corners well that's a corner cutting
machine<00:00:36.770> we<00:00:36.920> obviously<00:00:37.100> cut<00:00:37.520> them<00:00:37.670> their

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
machine we obviously cut them their

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.520 
machine we obviously cut them their
point<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.360> we've<00:00:38.600> always<00:00:38.870> done<00:00:39.199> things<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
point is we've always done things the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.380 
point is we've always done things the

bankrupt<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.399> time<00:00:46.790> for<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:47.000> cheaper<00:00:47.300> approach

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
bankrupt so time for a cheaper approach

allow<00:00:48.500> me<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.739> introduce<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.960> multiverse

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
allow me to introduce the multiverse

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.260 
allow me to introduce the multiverse
Infinite<00:00:52.160> Earths<00:00:52.340> with<00:00:52.730> an<00:00:52.820> infinite<00:00:53.239> number

of apertures and as of now they are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.040 
of apertures and as of now they are
going<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.880> take<00:00:56.000> over<00:00:56.270> all<00:00:56.420> test<00:00:56.719> chamber

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
going to take over all test chamber

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.020 
going to take over all test chamber
construction<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.770> more<00:00:58.340> importantly<00:00:58.730> all

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
construction and more importantly all

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.770 
construction and more importantly all

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
paying for test chamber construction why

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.600 
paying for test chamber construction why
are<00:01:02.840> they<00:01:03.020> agreeing<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.559> do<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.860> they're<00:01:04.430> not

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
are they agreeing to do that they're not

are they agreeing to do that they're not
we're<00:01:04.940> tricking<00:01:05.300> them<00:01:05.420> here's<00:01:06.380> how<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.619> works

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
we're tricking them here's how it works

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.820 
we're tricking them here's how it works
one<00:01:07.460> design<00:01:07.910> a<00:01:07.940> test<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:09.080> slip<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.680> mole

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
one design a test to slip the mole

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.590 
one design a test to slip the mole
monsters<00:01:10.009> or<00:01:10.490> what<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.119> blueprint

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
monsters or what have you the blueprint

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.050 
monsters or what have you the blueprint
when<00:01:11.750> they're<00:01:11.869> not<00:01:11.990> looking<00:01:12.280> three<00:01:13.280> once<00:01:13.880> they

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
when they're not looking three once they

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.380 
when they're not looking three once they
build<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.450> steal<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.380> back<00:01:15.910> look<00:01:16.910> at<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.119> sad

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
build it steal it back look at that sad

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.930 
build it steal it back look at that sad
little<00:01:17.539> octopus<00:01:18.020> yeah<00:01:18.860> that's<00:01:19.670> where<00:01:19.910> you

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
little octopus yeah that's where you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.150 
little octopus yeah that's where you
come<00:01:20.209> in<00:01:20.270> we<00:01:20.750> need<00:01:20.929> blueprints<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:21.800> are<00:01:21.950> about

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
come in we need blueprints we are about

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.650 
come in we need blueprints we are about
to<00:01:22.190> run<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.550> greatest<00:01:22.910> con<00:01:23.119> game<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.569> the
