is the amazing tap mind control
technology<00:03:30.920> which<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.910> was<00:03:32.060> macro<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.750> right

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
technology which I was macro up on right

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.990 
technology which I was macro up on right
now<00:03:33.160> alright<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:34.370> here's<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.670> best<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.940> can

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
now alright so here's the best I can

now alright so here's the best I can
macro<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.570> guess<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.770> I<00:03:37.100> mean<00:03:37.340> there's<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.580> tap

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
macro I guess so I mean there's a tap

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.090 
macro I guess so I mean there's a tap
line<00:03:38.090> control<00:03:38.480> technology<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.260> do<00:03:39.380> multiple

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
line control technology you do multiple

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.340 
line control technology you do multiple
things<00:03:40.130> with<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:40.760> stick<00:03:41.240> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.990> middle<00:03:42.170> as
