00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's going to go through so I've loaded
the<00:01:48.869> clasp<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.529> I've<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.279> string<00:01:50.639> tied<00:01:50.880> off

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the clasp in I've got my string tied off

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.840 
the clasp in I've got my string tied off
my<00:01:51.749> trick<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.259> wrap<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:53.069> button<00:01:53.579> twine

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
my trick is to wrap the button twine

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
my trick is to wrap the button twine
around<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.689> plunger<00:01:55.109> just<00:01:55.139> a<00:01:55.409> little<00:01:55.619> bit

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
around the plunger just a little bit

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.649 
around the plunger just a little bit
because<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.670> push<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.090> through<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.389> chair

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
because as I push this through the chair

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.330 
because as I push this through the chair
I<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.869> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> depress<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.799> plunger<00:01:58.889> yet

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I don't want to depress the plunger yet

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.209 
I don't want to depress the plunger yet
so<00:02:00.209> I'm<00:02:00.299> lining<00:02:00.539> everything<00:02:00.929> up<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.499> I'm

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so I'm lining everything up and I'm

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.449 
so I'm lining everything up and I'm
going<00:02:02.459> to<00:02:02.549> push<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:02.999> through<00:02:04.279> now<00:02:05.279> I'm<00:02:05.340> going

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
going to push it through now I'm going

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.429 
going to push it through now I'm going
to<00:02:05.549> turn<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.939> chair<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.289> where

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to turn this chair so you can see where

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.080 
to turn this chair so you can see where
the<00:02:07.529> back<00:02:07.709> of<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:07.889> needle<00:02:08.220> went

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.110 

now<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.959> needle<00:02:14.349> comes<00:02:14.590> through<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
now the needle comes through but the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.190 
now the needle comes through but the
plunger<00:02:16.690> area<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.650> through<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.099> padding

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
plunger area is just through the padding

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.540 
plunger area is just through the padding
once<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.470> clear<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.190> go<00:02:21.310> ahead<00:02:21.430> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
once that's clear you can go ahead and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.580 
once that's clear you can go ahead and
depress<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.330> plunger<00:02:22.450> from<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> front<00:02:23.260> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
depress the plunger from the front and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.710 
depress the plunger from the front and
there's<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.640> clasp<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.150> was<00:02:25.300> talking<00:02:25.660> about
