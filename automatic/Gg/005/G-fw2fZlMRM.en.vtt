once every day just fucking get easy

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.900 
once every day just fucking get easy
three<00:03:01.380> min<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> day<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:01.890> sometimes<00:03:02.400> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
three min a day because sometimes you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.670 
three min a day because sometimes you
