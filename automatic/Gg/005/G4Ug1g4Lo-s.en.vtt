in my opinion about me getting this new

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
in my opinion about me getting this new
is<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> chopper<00:02:08.819> gunner<00:02:08.849> or

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
is that I don't use a chopper gunner or

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.890 
is that I don't use a chopper gunner or
