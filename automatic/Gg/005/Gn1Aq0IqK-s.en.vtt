00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.010
 really great product 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 ultimately determined by the degree 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.450
 hardware and software integration 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.509
 funds 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 iphone development even more on and 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 modern screen demanded the most 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 great design effort and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.750
 design since submission 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.039
 original iphone 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.390
 47 inch display 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 iphone 6 got taller and wider we did 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.960
 body is much thinner at the same time 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 creating a smooth solid surface 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 comfortable to use and hold 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 we also present iphone 6 plus more 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.920
 large 5 5 inch display with the same 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.410
 solid surface and seamless change 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.210
 materials as in iphone 6 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 he is very subtle creating background 68 together 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.390
 we optimized the look for 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 gain software features 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 protective glass protrudes above 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.010
 surface to seamlessly connect 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 with aluminum uni body body in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.869
 the result is software and hardware 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:26.100
 collateral determines truly 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:29.659
 common experience of people interaction 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 the iphone always started the display 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.810
 so we did not imagine a big crane 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.869
 until we made it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.180
 great retina display hd 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.939
 This is the most advanced iphone display all 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.979
 what we did on this screen you can 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.560
 see a deeper black color and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.390
 clearer text with new up 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.829
 regional pixels you'll see more 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 accurate colors at wider angles 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.729
 to present these properties we 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.729
 applied advanced technology 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.899
 called photo alignment 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.540
 aligned pixels let you get 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.070
 excellent viewing experience 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 new ultra modern designed 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.340
 apple a8 chip continues our tradition by 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.720
 creating powerful energy efficient chips 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.400
 representing the second generation 6 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 four bit level architectures 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.540
 desktop solutions 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.220
 the gunner less he possesses faster 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.400
 better graphics and more 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.800
 energy efficient so you can 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 work longer without damage 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.510
 performance and work time we 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 was added a motion mode M8 coprocessor 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.390
 low power on fictitious 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.360
 monitor your daily activity 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.709
 and with the addition of a barometer, he can even 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 follow the height at which you 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 climbed like iphone steps 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 is the most popular camera in the world 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.370
 so we feel responsible for 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.330
 continued experience improvement 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.130
 of use 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.130
 allows you to adjust it for 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.400
 color and detail improvements before 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.610
 you took a picture iphone 6 plus has 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.290
 optical image stabilization for 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.250
 motion compensation of your hand 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.329
 gyro used 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.010
 then software 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.959
 intellectually combining frames with 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.470
 short long exposure to create 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.470
 clear image 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.609
 given the increasing number of people 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.780

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.910
 possible much faster 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.350
 downloads up to one hundred and fifty megabits per 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.550
 second built 20l then ranges 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.979
 significantly more than any other 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.570
 smartphone 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.280
 so you can use it yet
