00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:46.449 
cable to the back of the Ethernet port
like<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.670> use<00:02:44.030> your<00:02:44.239> hair<00:02:44.420> click<00:02:45.459> when

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
like so and you use your hair click when

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.610 
like so and you use your hair click when
it's<00:02:46.700> incorrectly<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.480> other<00:02:50.719> end<00:02:51.139> of<00:02:51.379> the

it's incorrectly the other end of the
network<00:02:52.180> work<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.629> go<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.620> cable<00:02:55.040> modem<00:02:55.760> or

network work to go to a cable modem or

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.990 
network work to go to a cable modem or
hub<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:59.030> so

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.140
