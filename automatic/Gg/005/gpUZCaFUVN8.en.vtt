first appearance this little bit of
movement<00:00:51.420> doesn't<00:00:52.020> seem<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> great<00:00:52.739> deal

what<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> does<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.390> translate<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
what it does when you translate that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
what it does when you translate that
into<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> Energy's<00:00:56.160> moved<00:00:56.670> around

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
into the way the Energy's moved around

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
into the way the Energy's moved around
the<00:00:57.149> binding<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> transfer<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> board<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the binding and transfer to the board it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
the binding and transfer to the board it
makes<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> massive<00:00:59.760> difference<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
makes a massive difference so with a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
makes a massive difference so with a
traditional<00:01:02.280> binding<00:01:02.870> when<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.140> onto<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
traditional binding when you go onto a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
traditional binding when you go onto a
turn<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.250> put<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> energy<00:01:05.729> into<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> frame

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
turn you put the energy into the frame

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
turn you put the energy into the frame
of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> high-back<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> energy<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of the high-back so all the energy is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.399 
of the high-back so all the energy is
going<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.060> board<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> center

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
going into the board have the center

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
going into the board have the center
points<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> board<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> now

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
points of the board with the now

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
points of the board with the now
bindings<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.890> rocking

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
bindings because you have that rocking

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
bindings because you have that rocking
motion<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:15.479> only<00:01:15.720> part<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> binding<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
motion the only part of the binding that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
motion the only part of the binding that
contacts<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> board<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.090> four<00:01:18.540> feet

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
contacts the board are these four feet

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.740 
contacts the board are these four feet
so<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> toe<00:01:20.400> side<00:01:20.670> turn<00:01:21.000> all

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so when you go on a toe side turn all

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.380 
so when you go on a toe side turn all
the<00:01:22.049> energy<00:01:22.409> shifts<00:01:23.250> onto<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.640> two<00:01:23.909> points

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the energy shifts onto these two points

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
the energy shifts onto these two points
basically<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> need<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> energy<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
basically where you need the energy to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.429 
basically where you need the energy to
be<00:01:26.670> along<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> edge<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> board<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
be along the edge of the board you can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.160 
be along the edge of the board you can
afford<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> run<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.369> far<00:01:29.790> shorter<00:01:30.060> high<00:01:30.390> by<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
afford to run a far shorter high by so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
afford to run a far shorter high by so
you<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.890> comfortable<00:01:32.250> binding

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
you have a really comfortable binding

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
you have a really comfortable binding
with<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> response<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> control<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.740> a

really<00:01:35.220> high-performance<00:01:35.430> stiff<00:01:36.119> binding

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
really high-performance stiff binding

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
really high-performance stiff binding
he's<00:01:37.500> convinced<00:01:37.950> me<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.820> the

he's convinced me to go out on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.539 
he's convinced me to go out on the

hovercraft with the knife awnings which

hovercraft with the knife awnings which
I'd<00:01:41.700> normally<00:01:41.850> never<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.780> always<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.350> my

I'd normally never do I always take my

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.160 
own bindings on testing board apparently
they're<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.950> it'll<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.340> feel

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
they're so good that it'll just feel

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.200 
they're so good that it'll just feel
first<00:01:48.650> time<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.580> talk<00:01:49.790> with<00:01:49.909> through<00:01:50.119> the

balls well the hovercraft well you could

describe it as a parable but that would

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.859 
describe it as a parable but that would
be<00:01:55.189> doing<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.880> at<00:01:55.970> kind<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.299> real<00:01:56.479> injustice

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.260 
be doing it at kind of a real injustice
because<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.830> lot<00:01:57.979> more<00:01:58.009> than<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.520> quite

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
because it's a lot more than that quite

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.510 
because it's a lot more than that quite
a<00:01:59.299> bit<00:01:59.600> stiffer<00:02:00.040> especially<00:02:01.040> towards<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
a bit stiffer especially towards the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.210 
a bit stiffer especially towards the
tail<00:02:01.820> where<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:02.810> also<00:02:03.049> scores<00:02:03.560> as<00:02:03.740> well<00:02:03.770> when

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
tail where this also scores as well when

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.010 
tail where this also scores as well when
you<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.640> thing<00:02:04.820> other<00:02:05.000> piece<00:02:08.020> so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
you get this thing other piece so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.830 
you get this thing other piece so
powerful<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:09.950> responsive<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.720> go

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
powerful and so responsive but you go

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
powerful and so responsive but you go
back<00:02:11.930> find<00:02:12.290> out<00:02:12.440> James<00:02:12.800> okay<00:02:13.340> well<00:02:13.640> I'm<00:02:13.819> gonna

now<00:03:07.960> bindings<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.100> felt<00:03:09.610> incredibly

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
now bindings it felt incredibly

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.270 
now bindings it felt incredibly
comfortable<00:03:10.750> straight<00:03:11.200> off<00:03:11.410> which<00:03:11.710> sometimes

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
comfortable straight off which sometimes

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.250

doesn't<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.120> happen<00:03:13.360> with<00:03:13.570> bindings<00:03:14.050> take

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
doesn't really happen with bindings take

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.410 
doesn't really happen with bindings take
a<00:03:14.290> while<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.860> used<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.490> don't<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:16.120> if

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
a while to get used to I don't know if

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.270 
a while to get used to I don't know if
it's<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.140> pivoting<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.830> does<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.160> or

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's the pivoting that does it or

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.770 
it's the pivoting that does it or
whether<00:03:18.490> it's<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.970> really<00:03:19.150> good<00:03:19.330> binding

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
whether it's just a really good binding

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.730 
whether it's just a really good binding
so<00:03:20.680> I'd<00:03:20.830> recommend<00:03:21.010> them<00:03:21.430> anyway
