00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi guys, I do not know how you guys happen. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.270
 but in the hair it very much embarrasses with the wind 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 it's impossible to comb 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 so I'll show you the super 8 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.610
 which has eight benefits for hair 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.610
 including untangling the wires 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 Look how comb slides more 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 easily 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.540
 remembering that the super 8 can be used 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.060
 in three ways 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 the shampoo as a pre-brush or as 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.510
 finisher like I used it now 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 Now I believe with hair, although I know 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 hairstyle I'll make a super look 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.160
 romantic is a built-in braid that goes 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160
 pulling to the side 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.110
 to start I'll put the whole 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.810
 hair back 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.880
 It's very simple at first, it's just you. 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.760
 split into three strands and braid 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.470
 normal to lock the beautiful finish 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.040
 it is important that the outside 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 go through the middle part you do 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.570
 this once and begins to embed always 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 in this side shit 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.880
 when you get to the end of the hair 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.650
 You make a normal braid and pull it 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.990
 by the side you want 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.280
 if I will pulling to the left here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.470
 Then you end up at the time you 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 I prefer as the scrap of hair I will not 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.210
 pulls too much until it points out that it does not 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.680
 very loose with elastic and secure the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.870
 end and then you can place the accessory 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.870
 romantic I chose this flower I go 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.880
 put her right here at the very end 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.650
 to make the look more natural, I 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.230
 I like to give a nipple as well 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.060
 of light in France she gets more loose 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.810
 and this is the result of our hairstyle 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.370
 romantic 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.300
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.300
 Kiss and see you next time
