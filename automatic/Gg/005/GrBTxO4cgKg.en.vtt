you<00:00:03.300> don't<00:00:03.480> change<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.799> k3v2<00:00:04.799> yep<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.759> this

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
you don't change the k3v2 yep is this

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850 
you don't change the k3v2 yep is this
the<00:00:06.000> k3v2<00:00:06.660> yeah<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.040> chip<00:00:08.309> name<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.800> how<00:00:10.800> do

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
the k3v2 yeah it's a chip name so how do

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.320 
the k3v2 yeah it's a chip name so how do
you<00:00:11.010> mean<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.400> fastest<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.090> world

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
64-bit memory is at the memory bandwidth
yes<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.500> power<00:00:43.680> spend<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.160> family<00:00:45.030> yeah<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
yes the power spend with family yeah you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.619 
yes the power spend with family yeah you
know<00:00:45.960> photo<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
know photo you know it's got a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.850 
know photo you know it's got a
smart<00:00:48.899> phones<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.620> computers<00:00:50.219> sister

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
smart phones there are computers sister

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.040 
smart phones there are computers sister
for<00:00:51.670> computer<00:00:51.970> system<00:00:52.300> three<00:00:52.690> seems<00:00:52.870> very

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
for computer system three seems very

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.850 
for computer system three seems very
very<00:00:53.320> important<00:00:53.770> cpu<00:00:54.670> GPU<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.470> memory

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
very important cpu GPU and the memory

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.340 
very important cpu GPU and the memory
anyways<00:00:57.450> so<00:00:58.450> is<00:00:58.570> this<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.720> fastest<00:00:59.170> memory

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
anyways so is this the fastest memory

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.380 
anyways so is this the fastest memory
bandwidth<00:00:59.800> in<00:00:59.950> the<00:00:59.980> market<00:01:00.310> yeah<00:01:00.880> currently

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
bandwidth in the market yeah currently

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.480 
bandwidth in the market yeah currently
you<00:01:01.900> know<00:01:02.380> it's<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> arm<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.160> sim

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
you know it's the arm of the sim

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.400 
you know it's the arm of the sim
compared<00:01:03.850> with<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.120> pc<00:01:04.510> yeah<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.290> the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
compared with the pc yeah so it's the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.400 
compared with the pc yeah so it's the
fastest<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.550> most<00:01:06.580> part<00:01:07.479> ken<00:01:07.750> camera

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410

Emily latest for ddr2 mobile yeah so how
early<00:01:22.180> can<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.900> say<00:01:23.080> how<00:01:23.229> many<00:01:23.290> gigabits<00:01:23.770> per

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
early can you say how many gigabits per

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.630 
early can you say how many gigabits per
gigabyte<00:01:24.430> per<00:01:24.580> second<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.680> clouds

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
a set-top box same same architecture but

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890 
a set-top box same same architecture but
this<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.490> latest<00:03:53.640> version<00:03:53.940> quad-core<00:03:54.720> now

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
this is the latest version quad-core now

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.020 
this is the latest version quad-core now
yeah<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.830> dual<00:03:56.010> core<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.370> also<00:03:56.610> using<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
yeah and the dual core is also using the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.640 
yeah and the dual core is also using the
same<00:03:57.210> architecture<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.870> market<00:03:58.230> same

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
same architecture of a market same

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.960 
same architecture of a market same
architecture<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.550> doubling<00:03:59.850> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
architecture so it's just doubling the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.760 
architecture so it's just doubling the
course<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.990> know<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.320> scalable
