00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 who all marina of alemannia 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 Yes 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.849
 hello sascha theisen like all of us 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.390
 suffering plague alemannia aachen 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.369
 Book author of several football books 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.919
 father of a son of the real 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.220
 Football plays and football nostalgic 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.780
 in this place more sad than happy 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.989
 which shows me what we lost again 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.989
 to have 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 so here at the old tivoli stand and look 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.030
 Over to new tivoli there is one 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 really very much in front of us 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.420
 like the development in the last 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.450
 years ago, that is very 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.550
 deplorable developments i think 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 It has been said a lot 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 Anger not only with me but with 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 many alemannia fans got out what 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 I always get clear 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 which place we stand is that we are 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.620
 very missing is that alemannia actually 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.150
 was and that is clear to me 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.680
 that somehow it will not come back 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 but that is unfortunately the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.380
 Present and as stupid as it sounds 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.100
 before what happened before that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100
 also the future 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.720
 what has been lost to us above all 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.549
 that's what this old tivoli is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.080
 has expressed the theory to our children 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.240
 to pass on so I go every week 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.250
 my son is eight here in stadium 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.689
 here at the front bravely goes along 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.560
 but I can tell them I actually 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.420
 why we go there 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.789
 and when we were here, there was so much 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.350
 of what you could convey well and 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.060
 I just can not do that anymore 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.289
 no longer give he was once was meter 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.920
 three and a half can not be today 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.140
 remember 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240
 I would like something for him 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.799
 from this old tivoli flirt with 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.970
 go away that he will someday 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.380
 maybe even go there alone 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.380
 but at the moment there are unfortunately black 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.910
 so when i stand here i remember 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.530
 me first to the stadium sausage the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.780
 We always brought here right here 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.730
 then the sausage shack stood at the bottom 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.580
 one got the sausage with one 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.710
 then blow mustard out of the plastic pot 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.080
 it is with the sausage here the stairs 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.930
 come up and as you already heard the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.400
 first slaughterhouse blog there one had 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.250
 For the first time then the goose bumps on 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.810
 back and looked on the field where the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.760
 guys have made warm is the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.620
 what I remember so on the s.den 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.310
 moments just before a game that was 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 actually always the most beautiful 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.620
 damn ax build here a few 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.540
 Roads call the center line and 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.990
 Outline and thinking have the whole 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.040
 monument set 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.040
 because you could roll if you are here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.920
 sometimes forget it goes into this one 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.720
 new stadium and think that's it 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.250
 now and you have come to terms with it 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.930
 and then you take care of yourself like now 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.909
 Just time again and then 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.349
 just once again clear what we lost 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.909
 has it has a lot of football 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.860
 atmosphere lost and a lot of 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.349
 what special we had something in our own 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.299
 Aachen and unfortunately we have one 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.099
 forget a bit forgotten in everyday life 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.180
 and forget about it in retrospect 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.180
 that totally hurt 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.890
 nostalgic, of course, I believe everyone 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.040
 the football really loves experienced 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.960
 simply in the past because 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.960
 Football is just the memories 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.170
 big moments big games a big one 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.830
 he play well and clearly there should I 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.610
 gladly in it 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.610
 and of course - absolutely 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.790
 Yes
