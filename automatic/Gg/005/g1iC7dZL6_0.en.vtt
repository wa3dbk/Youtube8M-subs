00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
think it it looks like it's gonna be a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.590 
think it it looks like it's gonna be a
really<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.460> close<00:03:23.820> representation<00:03:24.240> of

really really close representation of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.030 
really really close representation of
what<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.750> book<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
what the book is like I think that

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.710 
what the book is like I think that
adapted<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:27.090> from<00:03:27.360> what<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.600> can

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
adapted it really well from what I can

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.630 
adapted it really well from what I can
see<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.830> think<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> actors<00:03:29.490> look

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
