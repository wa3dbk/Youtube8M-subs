00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
right so today I'm going to be it's kind

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.570 
right so today I'm going to be it's kind
of<00:00:02.700> like<00:00:03.120> ever<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.419> visited<00:00:03.840> not<00:00:04.049> really<00:00:04.580> it's

of like ever you visited not really it's
hurricane<00:00:05.940> through<00:00:06.390> neo<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.870> only

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
hurricane through neo the only

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.140 
hurricane through neo the only
difference<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.010> video<00:00:08.250> as<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.730> boosted

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
difference is in this video as I boosted

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.560 
difference is in this video as I boosted
the<00:00:09.300> sponge<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:10.469> BALCO<00:00:11.389> temp<00:00:12.389> long<00:00:12.630> booster

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
the sponge with BALCO temp long booster

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the sponge with BALCO temp long booster
let<00:00:15.570> me<00:00:15.660> tell<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.039> was<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.190> worth<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:18.199> you<00:00:19.199> bet

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
let me tell you was it worth it you bet

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.580 
let me tell you was it worth it you bet
it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.949> worth<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.730> mean<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.960> apply<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> long

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it was worth it I mean to apply a long

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
it was worth it I mean to apply a long
booster<00:00:23.660> or<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> booster<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:26.359> on<00:00:27.359> any<00:00:27.599> rubber<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
booster or a booster on on any rubber it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
booster or a booster on on any rubber it
takes<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:29.359> roughly<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.510> four<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.929> five

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
takes about roughly like four to five

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.299 
takes about roughly like four to five
days<00:00:31.759> for<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.820> process<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:34.309> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
days for this process it because it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.709 
days for this process it because it
needs<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:35.940> least<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
needs you need at least like two to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.060 
needs you need at least like two to
three<00:00:36.750> layers<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> visitor<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> take

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
three layers for the visitor to take

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
three layers for the visitor to take
effect<00:00:38.489> which<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.450> need<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> apply<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> layer

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
effect which you need to apply a layer

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.950 
effect which you need to apply a layer
after<00:00:40.770> every<00:00:41.399> 12<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> 24<00:00:42.239> hours<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.780> why<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
after every 12 to 24 hours that's why it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
after every 12 to 24 hours that's why it
takes<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.469> long<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.329> see

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
takes so long and then as you can see

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
takes so long and then as you can see
the<00:00:45.750> rubber<00:00:45.930> starts<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> curl<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.579> got<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the rubber starts to curl and you got to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
the rubber starts to curl and you got to
wait<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> day<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.510> two<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> flatten

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wait like a day or two for it to flatten

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.950 
wait like a day or two for it to flatten
out<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.570> did<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:53.239> with<00:00:54.239> hurricane

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
out and I did it with with hurricane

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.430 
out and I did it with with hurricane
three<00:00:55.199> neo<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.910> let<00:00:57.120> me<00:00:57.210> tell<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.609> it's<00:00:59.609> beast

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
three neo now let me tell you it's beast

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
three neo now let me tell you it's beast
the<00:01:01.440> hurricane<00:01:01.829> 3<00:01:02.100> neo<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> monster<00:01:03.359> now

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the hurricane 3 neo was a monster now

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.260 
the hurricane 3 neo was a monster now
it's<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.409> all-out<00:01:05.189> beast<00:01:06.030> mode<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:07.220> mean<00:01:08.270> it's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's just all-out beast mode I mean it's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.090 
it's just all-out beast mode I mean it's
faster<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:13.189> falco<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:15.030> advertise<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
faster and falco they advertise this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
faster and falco they advertise this
booster<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.340> giving<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.119> enhanced<00:01:18.630> feeling<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
booster as giving an enhanced feeling of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.760 
booster as giving an enhanced feeling of
ball<00:01:19.320> control

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ball control

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.370 
ball control
I<00:01:20.210> completely<00:01:21.210> agree<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.780> feel<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
I completely agree I feel like I have

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700 
I completely agree I feel like I have
more<00:01:22.560> control<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.729> loop<00:01:24.030> under<00:01:24.540> spin<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
more control when I loop under spin it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
more control when I loop under spin it
was<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.009> effortless<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> did<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
was more effortless when I did it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
was more effortless when I did it
so<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.950> since<00:01:33.860> long<00:01:34.860> boosters<00:01:35.549> basically

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so and the since long boosters basically

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.710 
so and the since long boosters basically
stretch<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> rubber<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.420> boosters<00:01:39.420> what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
stretch out the rubber so boosters what

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
stretch out the rubber so boosters what
they<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.740> pile<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.159> sponge<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
they do is you pile on your sponge and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.440 
they do is you pile on your sponge and
what<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> sponge<00:01:42.930> does<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.430> rubber<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
what the sponge does on the rubber it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.719 
what the sponge does on the rubber it
starts<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> expand<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.710> bit<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.490> why<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
starts to expand a bit that's why the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
starts to expand a bit that's why the
rubber<00:01:48.210> starts<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.659> curl<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> does

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
rubber starts to curl and what this does

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
rubber starts to curl and what this does
is<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.490> stretching<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> top<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.659> now

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
is it's stretching the top see right now

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
is it's stretching the top see right now
which<00:01:52.259> gives<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.770> top<00:01:53.130> sheet<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.909> elastic

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
which gives the top sheet a more elastic

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.270 
which gives the top sheet a more elastic
inelastic<00:01:56.149> feeling<00:01:57.149> which<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.930> give<00:01:58.280> more

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
inelastic feeling which will give more

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
inelastic feeling which will give more
power<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.939> shots<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:04.350> worth<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
power to your shots and it's worth it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.059 
power to your shots and it's worth it
because<00:02:05.610> literally<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.680> speed

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
because literally you have more speed

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.790 
because literally you have more speed
you<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.849> more<00:02:09.209> control<00:02:09.599> looping<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.679> easier

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
you have more control looping is easier

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
you have more control looping is easier
and<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.540> lot<00:02:13.780> faster<00:02:14.620> smashing<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.460> good

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and it's a lot faster smashing is good

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.470 
and it's a lot faster smashing is good
topspin<00:02:17.260> drives<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.800> good

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
topspin drives are good

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.810 
topspin drives are good
that<00:02:19.480> being<00:02:19.720> said<00:02:20.020> pushes<00:02:20.620> are<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.370> affected

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
that being said pushes are not affected

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.900 
that being said pushes are not affected
at<00:02:21.910> all<00:02:22.230> every<00:02:23.230> time<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.470> push<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.950> could<00:02:24.640> still

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
at all every time I push I could still

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.290 
at all every time I push I could still
keep<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> ball<00:02:25.450> pretty<00:02:25.750> low<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:28.170> open<00:02:29.170> um

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
keep the ball pretty low and but open um

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.040 
keep the ball pretty low and but open um
once<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:32.130> shoot<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:34.770> once<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.890> like

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050

loop-the-loop under spin it gives your

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
they're either going to miss the table

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.220 
they're either going to miss the table
or<00:02:44.850> pop<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.060> ball<00:02:46.240> up<00:02:46.770> which<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:49.440> mean

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.930 
or pop the ball up which I mean
literally<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.920> hurricane<00:02:54.250> three<00:02:54.490> nail<00:02:54.670> is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
literally the hurricane three nail is

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.990 
literally the hurricane three nail is
nice<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:55.960> it's<00:02:56.320> awesome<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.630> mean<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
nice now it's awesome I mean for a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.860 
nice now it's awesome I mean for a
twenty<00:03:01.780> dollar<00:03:02.080> investment<00:03:02.740> and<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.640> $14<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.690> got

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
twenty dollar investment and a $14 I got

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.960 
twenty dollar investment and a $14 I got
it<00:03:05.050> over<00:03:05.260> fourteen<00:03:05.770> dollars<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:07.590> literally

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
it over fourteen dollars but literally

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.860 
it over fourteen dollars but literally
it's<00:03:09.970> probably<00:03:10.390> one<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.690> best

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it's probably one of the best

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.040 
it's probably one of the best
investments<00:03:11.590> I've<00:03:11.740> ever<00:03:11.920> done<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:16.050> it's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
investments I've ever done because it's

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.250 
investments I've ever done because it's
it's<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.830> amazing<00:03:18.340> what<00:03:18.580> what<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.420> but<00:03:19.780> how

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
it's just amazing what what this but how

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's just amazing what what this but how
it<00:03:20.410> feels<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:20.950> hands<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.580> gives<00:03:22.540> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it feels in the hands it gives you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140 
it feels in the hands it gives you
tremendous<00:03:22.870> feel<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> hands

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
tremendous feel in the hands

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.120 
tremendous feel in the hands
it<00:03:25.600> has<00:03:25.750> good<00:03:26.050> as<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.370> lot<00:03:28.000> better<00:03:28.330> speed<00:03:29.130> like

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
it has good as a lot better speed like

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.320 
it has good as a lot better speed like
regular<00:03:30.850> hurricane<00:03:31.240> three<00:03:31.420> now<00:03:31.570> as<00:03:33.330> good

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
regular hurricane three now as good

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.310 
regular hurricane three now as good
speed<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.950> multiply<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.610> by<00:03:36.670> three<00:03:37.150> no<00:03:37.990> by

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
speed now multiply that by three no by

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.980 
speed now multiply that by three no by
four<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:40.450> very<00:03:40.690> fast<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.350> like<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.770> and

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
four it's very fast and I like that and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.690 
four it's very fast and I like that and
and<00:03:43.990> it<00:03:44.200> does<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.680> would<00:03:44.800> say<00:03:45.130> does<00:03:45.370> enhance

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
and it does I would say does enhance

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.370 
and it does I would say does enhance
feeling<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> ball<00:03:46.300> control<00:03:46.600> because<00:03:46.930> looping

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
feeling a ball control because looping

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.449 
feeling a ball control because looping
under<00:03:47.560> spin<00:03:47.770> was<00:03:48.310> all<00:03:48.550> right<00:03:49.000> now<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:50.459> that's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
under spin was all right now it's that's

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.030 
under spin was all right now it's that's
awesome<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.140> whatever<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.770> want<00:03:53.920> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
awesome it's like whatever you want to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.570 
awesome it's like whatever you want to
do<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
do with it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.660 
do with it
it'll<00:03:55.330> do<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.980> before<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> rubber<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.459> just

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
it'll do it before the rubber is just

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.250 
it'll do it before the rubber is just
mainly<00:03:57.940> for<00:03:58.300> attacking<00:03:58.750> now<00:03:58.870> it's<00:03:59.020> more

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
mainly for attacking now it's more

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.750 
mainly for attacking now it's more
versatile<00:03:59.770> I<00:04:01.350> mean<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.650> don't<00:04:03.160> know<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.520> it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
versatile I mean I don't know it's it's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.580 
versatile I mean I don't know it's it's
in<00:04:03.970> you're<00:04:04.120> saying<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.959> have<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
in you're saying and I have it on the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.850 
in you're saying and I have it on the
carbon<00:04:05.980> blade<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:07.000> paleo<00:04:07.360> TCT<00:04:07.900> blade<00:04:08.170> which

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
carbon blade the paleo TCT blade which

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.420 
carbon blade the paleo TCT blade which
is<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> very<00:04:09.489> very<00:04:09.700> fast<00:04:10.090> blade<00:04:10.890> not<00:04:11.890> being<00:04:12.130> said

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
is a very very fast blade not being said

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.050 
is a very very fast blade not being said
boosting<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.120> rubber<00:04:13.390> doesn't<00:04:14.580> affect<00:04:15.580> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
boosting this rubber doesn't affect the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.500 
boosting this rubber doesn't affect the
performance<00:04:16.330> negatively<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.440> actually<00:04:17.950> works

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.560 

so<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:21.190> highly<00:04:22.190> highly<00:04:22.220> highly<00:04:22.580> highly

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
so I highly highly highly highly

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.200 
so I highly highly highly highly
recommend<00:04:24.290> boosting<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.370> hurricane<00:04:25.760> 3<00:04:25.970> neo

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
recommend boosting the hurricane 3 neo

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.100 
recommend boosting the hurricane 3 neo
sponge<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:28.090> very<00:04:29.090> recommend<00:04:29.660> tuning<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
sponge I very recommend tuning the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.700 
sponge I very recommend tuning the
rubber<00:04:30.320> because<00:04:32.140> you're<00:04:33.140> changing<00:04:33.350> a

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
rubber because you're changing a

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.340 
rubber because you're changing a
seventeen<00:04:34.220> dollar<00:04:34.520> rubber<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.660> perform<00:04:36.110> like

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
seventeen dollar rubber to perform like

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.060 
seventeen dollar rubber to perform like
a<00:04:36.380> sixty<00:04:36.860> dollar<00:04:37.010> rubber<00:04:37.400> no<00:04:37.970> joke<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:41.920> this<00:04:42.920> is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
a sixty dollar rubber no joke so this is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.520 
a sixty dollar rubber no joke so this is
just<00:04:43.340> basically<00:04:43.730> summing<00:04:44.030> up<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.330> review<00:04:44.780> of

just basically summing up the review of

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.420 
just basically summing up the review of
the<00:04:45.680> hurricane<00:04:46.010> three<00:04:46.250> neo<00:04:46.460> tuned<00:04:47.210> with<00:04:48.430> Falco

the hurricane three neo tuned with Falco
along<00:04:49.640> booster<00:04:50.770> so<00:04:53.800> I'll<00:04:54.800> see<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.010> guys<00:04:55.070> next
