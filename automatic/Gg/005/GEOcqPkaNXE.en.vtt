00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
android authority at CES 2013 and we're

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.560 
android authority at CES 2013 and we're
taking<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.160> first<00:00:08.370> hands-on<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:09.059> at<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
taking a first hands-on look at the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.330 
taking a first hands-on look at the
huawei<00:00:09.929> ascend<00:00:10.260> mate<00:00:10.440> versus<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> Galaxy

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
huawei ascend mate versus the Galaxy

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
huawei ascend mate versus the Galaxy
Note<00:00:11.370> 2<00:00:11.519> now<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> thought<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> Galaxy<00:00:12.840> Note<00:00:12.870> 2

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
Note 2 now I thought the Galaxy Note 2

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.959 
Note 2 now I thought the Galaxy Note 2
was<00:00:13.259> large<00:00:13.500> device<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:14.700> turning

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
was large device but it actually turning

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.340 
was large device but it actually turning
out<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.299> devices<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.870> actually<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
out that devices are actually going to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560 
out that devices are actually going to
get<00:00:16.440> bigger<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> 6.1<00:00:17.940> inch<00:00:18.180> display

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
get bigger so we have a 6.1 inch display

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
get bigger so we have a 6.1 inch display
here<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> resolution<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> 1280<00:00:19.949> by<00:00:20.160> 720

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
here with the resolution of 1280 by 720

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.790 
here with the resolution of 1280 by 720
it<00:00:21.390> does<00:00:21.630> feature<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.050> megapixel<00:00:22.260> camera<00:00:22.769> on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it does feature one megapixel camera on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
it does feature one megapixel camera on
the<00:00:22.890> front<00:00:23.029> Galaxy<00:00:24.029> Note<00:00:24.269> 2<00:00:24.300> has<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> 1.9

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the front Galaxy Note 2 has a 1.9

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.050 
the front Galaxy Note 2 has a 1.9
megapixel<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.490> feature<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.880> same

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
megapixel they do feature the same

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
megapixel they do feature the same
resolution<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> display<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> Galaxy

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680

resolution but the display on the Galaxy
Note<00:00:28.710> 2<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> 5.5<00:00:29.550> inches<00:00:29.880> versus<00:00:30.390> 6.1<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> the

Note 2 is 5.5 inches versus 6.1 on the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
Note 2 is 5.5 inches versus 6.1 on the
ascend<00:00:31.949> mate<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> rear<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.719> both

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
ascend mate on the rear we have a both

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
ascend mate on the rear we have a both
feature<00:00:34.469> an<00:00:34.590> 8<00:00:34.680> megapixel<00:00:34.800> camera<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
feature an 8 megapixel camera just to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.340 
feature an 8 megapixel camera just to
show<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> difference<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> size

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
show you the difference in size

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.310 
show you the difference in size
obviously<00:00:37.680> quite<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.280> substantial

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
obviously quite more substantial

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
obviously quite more substantial
very<00:00:40.980> similar<00:00:41.220> in<00:00:41.280> terms<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.610> width<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.090> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
very similar in terms of width it's just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
very similar in terms of width it's just
a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.660> taller<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.739> from<00:00:43.890> 5.5

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
a little bit taller but going from 5.5

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
a little bit taller but going from 5.5
inches<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:44.910> 6.1<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.380> screens

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
inches to 6.1 you can see the screens

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
inches to 6.1 you can see the screens
are<00:00:46.770> substantially<00:00:47.579> bigger<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> ascend

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
are substantially bigger on the ascend

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
are substantially bigger on the ascend
mate<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> performance<00:00:50.580> is<00:00:50.700> probably

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
mate so the performance is probably

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.490 
mate so the performance is probably
going<00:00:51.330> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.450> comparable<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.260> does<00:00:52.410> only

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
going to be comparable it does only

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.690 
going to be comparable it does only
feature<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:52.950> gigs<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> RAM<00:00:53.370> where's<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
feature more gigs of RAM where's the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.950 
feature more gigs of RAM where's the
galaxy<00:00:54.000> note<00:00:54.120> 2<00:00:54.239> features<00:00:54.540> two<00:00:54.690> gigs

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
galaxy note 2 features two gigs

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.360 
galaxy note 2 features two gigs
obviously<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
obviously I have a little bit of a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.619 
obviously I have a little bit of a
custom<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.790> going<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> nova

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
custom thing going on here with the nova

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
custom thing going on here with the nova
launcher<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.379> always<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> launcher<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
launcher it's always a launcher is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.030 
launcher it's always a launcher is
actually<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.540> customizable<00:01:01.080> as

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
actually really really customizable as

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually really really customizable as
we<00:01:02.220> saw<00:01:02.400> some<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:02.820> videos<00:01:03.089> we<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.330> indeed

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
we saw some of our videos we did indeed

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.749 
we saw some of our videos we did indeed
for<00:01:03.720> Berlin<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.160> really<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.550> look

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
for Berlin you can really make it look

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.730 
for Berlin you can really make it look
however<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:07.050> terms<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.350> weight<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
however you like in terms of weight in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
however you like in terms of weight in
the<00:01:07.800> hand<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.420> large

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the hand you can see it as a very large

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.359 
the hand you can see it as a very large
device<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.650> pretty<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
device it pretty much is going to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
device it pretty much is going to
require<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.940> handed<00:01:12.180> operation<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.810> most

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
require two handed operation for most

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
require two handed operation for most
things<00:01:13.140> real<00:01:13.950> web<00:01:14.280> browsing<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.640> all<00:01:14.759> that's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
things real web browsing and all that's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
things real web browsing and all that's
going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.720> joy<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.289> guy<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.830> our

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going to be a joy on this guy as our

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
going to be a joy on this guy as our
watching<00:01:17.310> movies<00:01:18.050> but<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.350> excellent

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
watching movies but it has excellent

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.400 
watching movies but it has excellent
viewing<00:01:20.190> angles<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> images<00:01:21.110> as<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.289> can

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
viewing angles on the images as you can

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.960 
viewing angles on the images as you can
see<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.740> believe<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:23.490> corporate's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
see I believe it probably corporate's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.150 
see I believe it probably corporate's
IPS<00:01:24.270> technology<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> performance<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> a

IPS technology the performance is a
little<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:26.460> slower<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> galaxy<00:01:27.060> note<00:01:27.090> 2

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
little bit slower in the galaxy note 2

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.900 
little bit slower in the galaxy note 2
from<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.600> experience<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.640> show<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
from my experience but just one show you

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.670 
from my experience but just one show you
guys<00:01:30.119> basically<00:01:30.360> decide<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.960> size<00:01:31.289> difference

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
guys basically decide to size difference
