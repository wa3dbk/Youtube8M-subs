00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
the electronic ignition that does a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.590 
the electronic ignition that does a
great<00:03:08.830> job<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.250> wish<00:03:09.520> I<00:03:09.910> wish<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.360> could<00:03:10.510> run

great job I wish I wish we could run

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.090 
great job I wish I wish we could run
tomorrow<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.110> 10<00:03:11.290> stuff<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.650> probably<00:03:11.890> had<00:03:12.069> a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
tomorrow for 10 stuff we probably had a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.309 
tomorrow for 10 stuff we probably had a
lot<00:03:12.160> more<00:03:12.310> reliability<00:03:12.970> than<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.270> magneto<00:03:13.690> but

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
lot more reliability than a magneto but

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.780 
lot more reliability than a magneto but
there<00:03:14.500> are<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> lot<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.800> questions<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:15.489> asked

to<00:03:15.970> change<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.530> we're<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.890> trying<00:03:18.160> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
to change you know we're not trying to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.640 
to change you know we're not trying to
determine<00:03:18.910> anybody<00:03:19.300> from<00:03:19.600> have<00:03:20.080> any<00:03:20.290> idea

this<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.880> very<00:03:22.180> first<00:03:22.569> skate<00:03:23.290> along

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
this is just the very first skate along

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.530 
this is just the very first skate along
the<00:03:23.650> way<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:24.040> myself<00:03:24.730> look<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.360> same

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the way I myself look like the same

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.380 
the way I myself look like the same
vectors<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.140> but<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.670> run<00:03:27.819> into<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.150> there

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
vectors on but you run into that there

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.580 
vectors on but you run into that there
you<00:03:28.480> go<00:03:28.630> here<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.840> add<00:03:28.989> another<00:03:29.200> couple

it's just an alternating you know you

group you can run away the weather group
they're<00:05:44.720> running<00:05:46.000> obviously<00:05:47.000> it's<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.300> going

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
between 25 and 30 races it's hydraulic

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.409 
between 25 and 30 races it's hydraulic
lifters<00:05:58.009> and<00:05:58.039> not<00:05:58.639> you<00:05:58.820> like<00:05:59.060> compression

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
lifters and not you like compression

around<00:05:59.990> 13<00:06:00.410> 5<00:06:02.590> we<00:06:03.590> use<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.889> throttle<00:06:04.310> body<00:06:04.340> for
