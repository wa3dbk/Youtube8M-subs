like a comet and what will happen here
is<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.950> because<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.790> reputation<00:02:13.780> they

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
is that because of that reputation they

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.770 
is that because of that reputation they
will<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.709> give<00:02:15.090> phenomenal<00:02:16.090> marks<00:02:16.480> for
