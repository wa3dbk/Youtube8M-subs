even the Russians who are backing them

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.760 
even the Russians who are backing them
as<00:01:12.540> well<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.020> would<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> major<00:01:13.500> escalation

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
as well it would be a major escalation

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
as well it would be a major escalation
on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.820> part<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> United<00:01:15.420> States<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.869> give

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
on the part of the United States to give

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
on the part of the United States to give
some<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.619> material<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> Ukrainians

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
some of that material to the Ukrainians

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
some of that material to the Ukrainians
but<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> reality<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.680> president

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
but the reality is is that the president

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.020 
but the reality is is that the president
could<00:01:20.580> decide<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.390> give<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:22.560> modest<00:01:23.040> arms<00:01:23.850> at

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
could decide to give more modest arms at

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
could decide to give more modest arms at
this<00:01:24.299> point<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> maybe<00:01:25.170> dole<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.950> over

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
this point and maybe dole it out over

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.149 
this point and maybe dole it out over
time<00:01:26.840> escalate<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
time escalate it just as the if the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
time escalate it just as the if the
crisis<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.700> escalate<00:01:30.030> further<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.689> well<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
crisis would escalate further as well so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
crisis would escalate further as well so
he<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.860> options<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.329> all

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
he has some options here it's not all

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
he has some options here it's not all

whatever differences there may be in
public<00:02:11.180> or<00:02:11.600> they're<00:02:12.320> more<00:02:12.560> likely<00:02:12.800> going<00:02:13.070> to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
public or they're more likely going to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.680
