00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
Tabata which basically you do like a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.250

the<00:04:13.850> gym<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.150> not<00:04:14.269> too<00:04:14.420> far<00:04:14.600> away<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.799> thought

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
the gym is not too far away so I thought

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.650 
the gym is not too far away so I thought
this<00:04:16.280> would<00:04:16.340> be<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.609> perfect<00:04:16.850> opportunity<00:04:17.150> to

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
this would be a perfect opportunity to

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.530 
this would be a perfect opportunity to
show<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.669> no<00:04:19.669> matter<00:04:19.700> how<00:04:20.030> much<00:04:20.239> someone

into<00:04:23.479> fitness<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.140> health<00:04:24.260> someone<00:04:24.500> is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
into fitness and health someone is

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.080 
into fitness and health someone is
everybody<00:04:25.010> has<00:04:25.160> days<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.610> they<00:04:25.700> don't<00:04:25.910> want

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
everybody has days that they don't want

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.749 
everybody has days that they don't want
to<00:04:26.150> go<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.419> gym

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
to go to the gym

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.170 
to go to the gym
but<00:04:27.759> and<00:04:28.750> I'm<00:04:28.900> all<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.860> listening<00:04:30.759> to<00:04:31.090> your

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
but and I'm all for listening to your

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.180 
but and I'm all for listening to your
body<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.600> taking<00:04:31.960> days<00:04:32.169> off<00:04:32.199> when<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:33.009> need

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
body and taking days off when you need

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.400 
body and taking days off when you need
to<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.360> if<00:04:34.449> you're<00:04:34.570> truly<00:04:34.810> sick<00:04:35.139> then

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
to and I think if you're truly sick then

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.230 
to and I think if you're truly sick then
you<00:04:35.979> should<00:04:36.160> take<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> day<00:04:36.430> off<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:36.729> sometimes

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
you should take a day off and sometimes

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
you should take a day off and sometimes
you<00:04:37.389> just<00:04:37.509> need<00:04:37.720> mental<00:04:38.620> days<00:04:38.860> where<00:04:39.190> it's

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you just need mental days where it's

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.300 
you just need mental days where it's
like<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:40.030> need<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.240> take<00:04:40.449> a<00:04:40.479> day<00:04:40.690> off<00:04:41.310> but

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
like you need to take a day off but

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.770 
like you need to take a day off but
there<00:04:42.759> are<00:04:42.850> some<00:04:42.970> times<00:04:43.210> when<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.449> just<00:04:43.479> need

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
there are some times when you just need

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.290 
there are some times when you just need
to<00:04:44.020> tough<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.320> out<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.889> anyways<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.699> if

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
to tough it out and go anyways and if

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.320 
to tough it out and go anyways and if
you<00:04:46.419> only<00:04:46.630> went<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.139> gym<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.850> only<00:04:49.030> did

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
you only went to the gym if you only did

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.510 
you only went to the gym if you only did
something<00:04:49.600> when<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.810> truly<00:04:49.990> wanted<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.520> you

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
something when you truly wanted to you

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.850 
something when you truly wanted to you
would<00:04:51.699> probably<00:04:52.090> never<00:04:52.590> accomplish<00:04:53.590> what

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
would probably never accomplish what

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.040 
would probably never accomplish what
you're<00:04:54.820> setting<00:04:55.090> out<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.330> accomplish<00:04:55.479> thought

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
you're setting out to accomplish thought

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.230 
you're setting out to accomplish thought
make<00:04:56.229> sense<00:04:56.500> if<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.550> only<00:04:57.729> went<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.120> gym

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
make sense if I only went to the gym

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.710 
make sense if I only went to the gym
every<00:04:59.669> time<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.789> wanted<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.150> i'd<00:05:01.270> probably<00:05:01.479> be

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
every time I wanted to i'd probably be

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.469 
every time I wanted to i'd probably be
there<00:05:01.900> like<00:05:02.139> three<00:05:02.410> fourths<00:05:02.710> of<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.830> time<00:05:03.479> so

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
there like three fourths of the time so

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.670 
there like three fourths of the time so
sometimes<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.960> just<00:05:05.050> have<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.260> tough<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:05.590> out

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
sometimes you just have to tough it out

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.290 
sometimes you just have to tough it out
and<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.400> anyways<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:06.789> get<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.210> over

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
and just do it anyways and get it over

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.779 
and just do it anyways and get it over
with<00:05:07.510> i'm<00:05:08.500> sorry<00:05:08.740> i'm<00:05:08.919> like<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.400> really<00:05:09.639> busy
