00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
the gamepad control badly because it was

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
I think is one of the best additions to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.230 
I think is one of the best additions to
this<00:02:45.530> game<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.370> way<00:02:46.490> they<00:02:46.640> portray<00:02:47.060> how

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
this game is the way they portray how

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.760 
this game is the way they portray how
Mario<00:02:47.570> moves<00:02:47.960> through<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> map

Mario moves through the map

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
Mario moves through the map

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.530 
of the previous games this one actually
