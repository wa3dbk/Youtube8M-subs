 6 to the youtube days and channel 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 accounting 26 sergio a humble servant 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820

 is navas 10 you know that if you want 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.759
 inform you of all the information that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 I did in the code deiss too 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.779
 follow us on facebook by and senna code and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 if you want all the technical details 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 at the end reviews articles news and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 senna dot net is your space 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 good technological diary in this video 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.460
 let's do a tour of the best 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.719
 applications for mobile devices 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.720
 you already know for free for a limited time 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 we start with perpetual a generates the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
 contact application that is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.410
 available for iphone and for android is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 a great discovery fra manauta us 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.560
 recommended it a few days ago in astana 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.540
 code dot net and is an excellent 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.489
 application let's get into it for 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.630
 do a quick tour through the interface os 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.430
 I explain a little bit what this 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.620
 perpetual application keeps us 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.470
 updated our contact list 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.119
 we install perpetually we put 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.369
 our phone number and we put 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 our email with our name of such 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.970
 way that all our friends that at 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.009
 final have us on your agenda 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.890
 and that then in the end when we 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.780
 we change the number d 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.479
 the agenda of our friends is going to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.159
 update without doing them anything and if I 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 I have to tell him that I changed the 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.970
 phone number would not equal me 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.070
 me not if some friend of mine who has 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.080
 perpetuals and he also changes the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 phone number or email for my 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830
 contact list would be updated if 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.840
 transparently if you do not know 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.790
 absolutely nothing is something very 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.810
 interesting to be able to have the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.090
 end there are contacts 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.830
 perfectly complete and at the end with 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.060
 the interesting data we're not going to do 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 a tour through the quick interface 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 notifications we see a little people 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.220
 that we have in contacts and that have 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.539
 put into perpetual let's see a 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.190
 little progress at the end are 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.420
 perpetual statistics on people 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.090
 who uses it from our agenda 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.860
 contacts in the option of me here is 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.360
 where are we going to be able to tell you that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 we have changed the email or the number 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.289
 super interesting phone for what 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.429
 so I repeat so that all are updated 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.399
 the agendas of the people who use 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.080
 perpetually remotely and doing nothing 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.030
 works in background the application is 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.040
 exquisite then we have here something super 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 interesting packard here we will be able to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.370
 make a backup of all 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.440
 our contacts is essential 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 but also apart from making the copy 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.080
 of security we can restore a copy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.760
 that we have done 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.590
 and this seems very cool to me because I 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.330
 I have an iphone and I also have a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.100
 android in such a way that I'm going to 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.750
 have the same contacts the two 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.820
 devices thanks to this application 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 of perpetual that as I say it is for 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.990
 it is and for android and a logo for 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.360
 finalize here in account then I can 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.730
 change the password the name of 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.710
 user and I can share over the networks 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.930
 social this great application that you 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.060
 I advise you to put it on because it is a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.740
 more cap that I think we should all 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.700
 have boys and girls to have a 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.200
 completely healthy agenda we continue 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.030
 well, mayer script calculator is 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.860
 an application available for this is and 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.140
 for android that really is very good 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.550
 to do mathematical operations 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.690
 see what we are going to do 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.330
 what we have here we are going to make a 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.980
 simple mathematical operation 2 + 2 and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.870
 automatically simply putting 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.970
 this gives us the result but we can 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.950
 do mathematical operations a little bit 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.380
 more complex for example is here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.940
 a square root then two at the end 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.190
 notice that we can extend the result 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.020
 this way in agreement guys is a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.370
 super complex application and to know 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.990
 a little bit since all the operations 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.880
 that we have here we have a 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.200
 tutorial when they explain how 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.180
 use it and here fixed 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.349
 let's see all the operations that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.640
 we can do is really very 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.040
 interesting we have the number or the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.440
 number pi logarithms we have the final 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.269
 trigonometry sines cosines and so on 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.430
 square roots good all 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.800
 essential operations we are going to 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.690
 have here in a finger stroke and 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.390
 simply typing the operation 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.180
 three for two for example to note that already 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.920
 we will leave then the entire result 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.790
 very interesting this application I the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.620
 I recommend and we continue good 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.330
 we come to the area in game and we are 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.069
 liking this video and especially if you 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.510
 like the dead series for free as you can 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.430
 support us with a like for 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.720
 prove it thank you very much guys and 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.700
 good girls we continue with a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.220
 video game for it is and for android 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.230
 which is called ninjas this moment scrolls 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.910
 let's give it to continue so you can see 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.100
 a little bit, how does it work? 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.440
 three slots to save different groups 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.419
 of games and well this is the character 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.680
 notice that we move on this map a 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.389
 casual video game divided by 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.280
 different very interesting missions 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.960
 where we are going to be able to recreate 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.330
 any of the missions that we 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.040
 we have previously played to note that 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.750
 this one is pretty cool and look how it 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.129
 move we are going to approach in this way 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.779
 and notice that a stone appears 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.979
 we have to dodge the 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.169
 stone and we also have to go 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.629
 annihilating enemies and dodging 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.459
 the above all that will follow us in 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.899
 this path at the end to save us 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:47.269
 of this rock in the purest Indian style 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:48.739
 jones that we are going to find in the end 

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:50.539
 we have to overcome then different 

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:52.429
 very cool maps like this for example 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.959
 let's continue with another pong we have 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:55.459
 changed the map and just so that 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:57.080
 see a little bit what is the essence of 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.449
 this video game we have different 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.669
 attacks we are some mijas we have some 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.379
 ninja stars we can stick more 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.239
 chanted at the end to all these enemies 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.339
 also by style because double dragon tar 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:08.479
 they gave ages or similar and note that 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.740
 we also have a store where 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.479
 us with the money that we go 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.429
 getting playing of course 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.499
 to be able to buy different weapons 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:18.019
 truth is that it is something very very video game 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.879
 addictive of the classic arcade that does not 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.009
 you can let escape for free for time 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.240
 limited for them and for android 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.310
 we continue 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.110
 Well, now we are at the end of 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.240
 this tour, notice that here in this 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.009
 video game phoenix hd we will be able to 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.110
 compete against everyone in a 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.699
 ranking based on the points that 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.169
 you get then you are going to compete 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.180
 and here on the map, you are going to see a 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.740
 little bit your statistics and go to 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.030
 because compete at the end with everyone 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.160
 I think I'm pretty cool 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.020
 very much like competitive games and 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.910
 with this, you are going to be able to try 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.470
 at least get as far as possible in 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.840
 this video game you have to choose to 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.009
 start a ship let's take these the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.810
 others are for payment so I advise you 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.370
 that you play only with this that the 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.750
 goal is simply to have fun 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.310
 see what we can buy 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.470
 enhancers as you are seeing with the 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.580
 money that we get playing and 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.409
 simply the video game is the 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.569
 next to the purest arcade style of 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.770
 recreational machines we put the finger to 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.539
 final on our screen 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.400
 device and us why are we going 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.530
 moving in this way trying to kill 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.300
 in the end to all the enemies that we are 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.069
 put a video game ahead of you 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.780
 surely he has delighted 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.490
 all the gamers of yesteryear as I say 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.319
 the arcade machines and what can 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.060
 redo now if in your 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.250
 mobile devices this game in 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.210
 concrete is compatible with it is a 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.699
 video game that we have to go forward 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.780
 dodging enemy shots and over 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.450
 all facing 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.670
 at the end to the final ships the 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.650
 final enemies of each of these 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.480
 missions is an old continuous is not 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.280
 divided by missions not but obviously 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.020
 we are moving forward in the videogame and
