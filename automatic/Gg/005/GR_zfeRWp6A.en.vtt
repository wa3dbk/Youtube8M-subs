all right hello everyone so just be a
quick<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.649> really<00:00:08.099> mod<00:00:08.790> that's

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
quick video on a really mod that's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.600 
quick video on a really mod that's
actually<00:00:09.240> quite<00:00:09.360> simple<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.340> pretty<00:00:11.340> easy<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
actually quite simple and pretty easy to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.940 
actually quite simple and pretty easy to
do<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.059> takes<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.840> rapid<00:00:13.349> strike<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.710> Cal

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
do and takes this rapid strike to Cal

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
do and takes this rapid strike to Cal
where<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.340> should<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:15.020> as<00:00:16.020> you've<00:00:16.199> probably

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
where it should be as you've probably

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.910 
where it should be as you've probably
seen<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.830> lot<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.010> other<00:00:17.190> modified<00:00:18.920> rapid

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
seen in a lot of other modified rapid

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
seen in a lot of other modified rapid
strikes<00:00:20.449> anyway<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.920> simple<00:00:22.920> enough<00:00:23.330> take

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
strikes anyway so simple enough take

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.939 
strikes anyway so simple enough take
this<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.660> obviously<00:00:25.170> four<00:00:25.350> C<00:00:25.500> batteries<00:00:25.529> are

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this out obviously four C batteries are

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.700 
this out obviously four C batteries are
really<00:00:26.220> heavy<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.050> you're<00:00:28.050> only<00:00:28.199> getting<00:00:28.349> six

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
really heavy and you're only getting six

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160 
really heavy and you're only getting six
volts<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:30.570> enough<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.900> this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
volts and it's just not enough for this

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.290 
volts and it's just not enough for this
blaster<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.610> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> open<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.120> up

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
blaster if you don't want to open it up

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920 
blaster if you don't want to open it up
and<00:00:33.540> potentially<00:00:34.579> ruin<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.660> thing<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and potentially ruin it one thing I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130 
and potentially ruin it one thing I
thought<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.280> these<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.420> battery

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
thought was that these little battery

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.130 
thought was that these little battery
packs<00:00:40.820> here<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> often<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:42.899> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
packs here I often use them because I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
packs here I often use them because I'm
a<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.579> lot<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> mods<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.870> regular

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
a I do a lot of mods for just regular

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
a I do a lot of mods for just regular
double-a<00:00:46.410> batteries<00:00:46.710> any<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.550> thing<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
double-a batteries any one thing you can

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 
double-a batteries any one thing you can
do<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.020> try<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> put<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.160> ultra<00:00:50.969> fires<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> here

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
do is try to put in ultra fires in here

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.770 
do is try to put in ultra fires in here
but<00:00:52.199> I've<00:00:52.350> heard<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> may<00:00:53.570> trip<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but I've heard that it may trip the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
but I've heard that it may trip the
thermistors<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:56.149> resistors<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> camera<00:00:57.570> which

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thermistors or resistors a camera which

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
thermistors or resistors a camera which
is<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.320> whatever<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
is in this one but whatever the one of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.189 
is in this one but whatever the one of
the<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> basically<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.809> it'll<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the two and basically what it'll do is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.340 
the two and basically what it'll do is
it<00:01:01.530> won't<00:01:01.770> allow<00:01:02.840> it'll<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.140> shut

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it won't allow it'll actually just shut

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.390 
it won't allow it'll actually just shut
the<00:01:04.439> blaster<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:07.040> but<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> nice<00:01:08.369> thing

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the blaster down and but the nice thing

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
the blaster down and but the nice thing
is<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> similar

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is we can kind of go to a similar

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.950 
is we can kind of go to a similar
voltage<00:01:10.790> with<00:01:11.790> double-a<00:01:12.270> batteries<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
voltage with double-a batteries because

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.880 
voltage with double-a batteries because
they<00:01:13.049> don't<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.320> his<00:01:13.409> mother<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.740> much

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they don't put his mother as much

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
they don't put his mother as much
amperage<00:01:14.299> your<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.659> doesn't<00:01:15.840> seem<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> trip

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
amperage your it doesn't seem to trip

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.070 
amperage your it doesn't seem to trip
the<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> resistors<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> thermistors

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the the resistors or the thermistors

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
the the resistors or the thermistors
okay<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.590> yeah<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.390> what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
okay so yeah so you have this and what

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
okay so yeah so you have this and what
you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> did<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you can do is or what I did was I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
you can do is or what I did was I
basically<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.210> cut<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> hole<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.530> I'm

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
basically just cut a hole in it so I'm

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.719 
basically just cut a hole in it so I'm
kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> using<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.250> sort<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> rough

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
kind of using this as sort of a rough

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
kind of using this as sort of a rough
template<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> need<00:01:31.049> for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
template of kind of what you need for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679 
template of kind of what you need for
your<00:01:31.920> hole<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.450> left

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
your hole one thing I want to do left

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.789 
your hole one thing I want to do left
that<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.930> haven't<00:01:34.079> done<00:01:34.229> yet<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
that I haven't done yet is I'm just

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
that I haven't done yet is I'm just
going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> paint<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:37.549> lick<00:01:38.549> tape

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going to paint this with a lick tape

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.969 
going to paint this with a lick tape
just<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.350> it'll<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.799> cover

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
just so that way it'll kind of cover

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.330 
just so that way it'll kind of cover
that<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.970> case<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.570> shouldn't

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
that just say just in case it shouldn't

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
that just say just in case it shouldn't
short<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> case<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
short out but just in case it's not a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
short out but just in case it's not a
bad<00:01:46.320> idea<00:01:46.350> well<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.670> found<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
bad idea well one thing i found is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
bad idea well one thing i found is
RadioShack<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.560> carrying<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.040> heavier

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
RadioShack is now carrying these heavier

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.810 
RadioShack is now carrying these heavier
duty<00:01:51.079> verses<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.670> tell

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
duty verses this one or if you can tell

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
duty verses this one or if you can tell
a<00:01:53.850> difference<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.390> camera<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.189> like

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
a difference in camera but this is like

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
a difference in camera but this is like
a<00:01:56.399> fabric<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.540> thing<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.990> find<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
a fabric kind of thing and I find you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.420 
a fabric kind of thing and I find you
take<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:58.799> or<00:01:58.890> four<00:01:59.040> times<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
take it off three or four times and it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280 
take it off three or four times and it
kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> gets<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.240> torn<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.229> I'm

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
kind of gets pretty torn up so I'm

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
kind of gets pretty torn up so I'm
really<00:02:01.439> liking<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.490> disease<00:02:03.090> in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
really liking that I have the disease in

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.810 
really liking that I have the disease in
stock<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.020> camera<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.680> store<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
stock now and this camera in store it's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
stock now and this camera in store it's
just<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> hard<00:02:06.240> plastic<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> quite<00:02:07.619> nice

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
just a hard plastic which is quite nice

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.360 
just a hard plastic which is quite nice
does<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.119> any<00:02:09.330> called<00:02:09.810> their<00:02:09.989> heavy<00:02:10.140> duty

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
does that any called their heavy duty

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.320 
does that any called their heavy duty
sadly<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.459> don't<00:02:11.550> put<00:02:11.700> heavier<00:02:11.970> wire<00:02:12.150> but

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
sadly they don't put heavier wire but

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.930 
sadly they don't put heavier wire but
which<00:02:13.630> would<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.810> nice<00:02:13.990> but<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:15.550> least<00:02:15.670> I'm<00:02:15.820> too

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
which would be nice but at least I'm too

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.980 
which would be nice but at least I'm too
worried<00:02:16.060> about<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.240> falling<00:02:16.480> apart<00:02:16.570> when

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
worried about it falling apart when

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.310 
worried about it falling apart when
you're<00:02:17.140> dealing<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.440> stuff<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:19.320> yeah

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
you're dealing with stuff like this yeah

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.690 
you're dealing with stuff like this yeah
and<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.830> bait<00:02:21.010> yeah<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.370> basically<00:02:21.460> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and you can bait yeah so basically you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.550 
and you can bait yeah so basically you
want<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.880> cut<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> hole<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.750> went<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.350> little

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
want to cut the hole I went a little

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.200 
want to cut the hole I went a little
overzealous<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> ended<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.550> having<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.910> add

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
overzealous so I ended up having to add

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.410 
overzealous so I ended up having to add
back<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:26.170> little<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:27.460> used<00:02:27.520> quick<00:02:27.880> steel

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
back in a little I used quick steel

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.950 
back in a little I used quick steel
I'm<00:02:29.170> epoxy<00:02:29.950> putty<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> reinforce

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
I'm epoxy putty and just to reinforce

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.210 
I'm epoxy putty and just to reinforce
that<00:02:32.260> because<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:33.960> yeah<00:02:34.960> anyway<00:02:35.440> pretty

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that because it yeah anyway pretty

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.210 
that because it yeah anyway pretty
simple

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
simple

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.080 
simple
yeah<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.340> pretty<00:02:39.430> straightforward<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.970> fits

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
yeah it's pretty straightforward it fits

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.330 
yeah it's pretty straightforward it fits
right<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.320> tip<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.710> try<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.950> set<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.250> up

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
right in and one tip I try to set it up

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.050 
right in and one tip I try to set it up
so<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.670> slides<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:43.540> way<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:45.100> let's<00:02:45.970> throw

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
so it slides in this way so let's throw

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.220 
so it slides in this way so let's throw
it<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.270> real<00:02:46.450> quick<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> when<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.810> throw<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.110> in

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it on real quick so when you throw it in

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
it on real quick so when you throw it in
throw<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.040> way<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.880> slides

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
throw it in that way because this slides

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.260 
throw it in that way because this slides
nicer<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.620> side<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> find<00:02:54.190> sometimes<00:02:54.430> it'll

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
nicer this side I find sometimes it'll

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.780 
nicer this side I find sometimes it'll
catch<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> edges<00:02:57.370> when<00:02:57.670> you're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
catch on one of the edges when you're

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.120 
catch on one of the edges when you're
trying<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.970> pull<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.270> out<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:59.320> other<00:02:59.980> than

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
trying to pull it out but other than

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.090 
trying to pull it out but other than
that<00:03:00.250> yeah<00:03:00.460> you<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:00.730> slide<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.210> like<00:03:01.390> that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
that yeah you just slide it in like that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.400 
that yeah you just slide it in like that
alright<00:03:03.100> so<00:03:03.130> we're<00:03:04.120> going<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.270> stock<00:03:04.990> firing
