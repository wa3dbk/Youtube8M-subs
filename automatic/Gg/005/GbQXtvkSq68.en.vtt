00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
exercise that we teach basically it kind

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.000 
exercise that we teach basically it kind
of<00:01:01.070> breaks<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.960> fear<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.440> students

getting<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.460> truck<00:01:04.699> moving<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.180> around

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
getting in the truck moving it around

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.990 
getting in the truck moving it around
they're<00:01:06.260> teaching<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.040> gear<00:01:07.250> pattern<00:01:07.670> first

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
they're teaching the gear pattern first

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.480 
they're teaching the gear pattern first
you'll<00:01:08.420> be<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.660> first<00:01:08.930> gear<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:10.070> back<00:01:10.340> in

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
you'll be in first gear and just back in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.670 
you'll be in first gear and just back in
the<00:01:10.580> truck<00:01:10.820> up<00:01:11.000> back<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.360> forth<00:01:11.450> from<00:01:12.229> mainly

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the truck up back and forth from mainly

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.770 
the truck up back and forth from mainly
the<00:01:13.010> first<00:01:13.250> part<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.790> moment<00:01:14.270> morning

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the first part of the moment morning

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.540 
the first part of the moment morning
then<00:01:15.350> actually<00:01:15.680> after<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.190> student

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
then actually after the student

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.860 
then actually after the student
accomplished<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> straight<00:01:17.360> line<00:01:17.570> then<00:01:17.810> we

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
accomplished the straight line then we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.080 
accomplished the straight line then we
move<00:01:18.050> them<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.710> actual<00:01:19.000> backing<00:01:20.000> with

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
move them on to the actual backing with

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.810 
move them on to the actual backing with
exercises<00:01:21.050> which<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.440> outside<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:22.490> parallel

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
exercises which is outside in parallel

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.700 
exercises which is outside in parallel
park<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.810> we<00:01:23.900> usually<00:01:24.080> don't<00:01:24.350> move<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
park and we usually don't move the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.469 
park and we usually don't move the
student<00:01:25.040> on<00:01:25.190> until<00:01:25.550> they<00:01:25.670> conquer<00:01:26.300> each<00:01:26.900> step

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.300 

the<00:01:34.290> student<00:01:34.619> instructor<00:01:34.920> duration<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the student instructor duration is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
the student instructor duration is
usually<00:01:35.580> about<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> four<00:01:36.270> students<00:01:36.659> per

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
usually about three to four students per

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.190 
usually about three to four students per
instructor<00:01:38.240> everybody's<00:01:39.240> everybody's<00:01:39.960> bar

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
instructor everybody's everybody's bar

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
instructor everybody's everybody's bar
and<00:01:40.560> everybody<00:01:40.950> learns<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.520> different<00:01:41.909> measure

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and everybody learns a different measure

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.350 
and everybody learns a different measure
so<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.930> adjust<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.970> students

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so we can really adjust to the students

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120 
so we can really adjust to the students
needs<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.350> student<00:01:46.649> needs<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.040> bit

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
needs if the student needs a little bit

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
needs if the student needs a little bit
more<00:01:47.280> training<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.659> have

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
more training than we have we have

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.190 
more training than we have we have
overtime<00:01:49.590> help<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.509> after<00:01:51.509> school<00:01:51.750> help<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
overtime help and after school help to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.420 
overtime help and after school help to
help<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.979> depends<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.310> what

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
help them out it just depends on what

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.170 
help them out it just depends on what
the<00:01:53.520> student<00:01:53.850> needs

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.970 

we<00:02:00.750> understand<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.620> students

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
we understand that some of the students

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.950 
we understand that some of the students
get<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.250> quicker<00:02:02.460> than<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.760> others<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.300> we

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
get it quicker than the others so we

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.040 
get it quicker than the others so we
kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.380> base<00:02:04.620> our<00:02:04.830> training<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:06.050> student

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
kind of base our training on a student

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.800 
kind of base our training on a student
on<00:02:07.260> an<00:02:07.380> individual<00:02:07.950> students<00:02:08.369> needs<00:02:08.820> so<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
on an individual students needs so if a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
on an individual students needs so if a
student<00:02:10.020> picks<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.070> pre-trip<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
student picks up the pre-trip and the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.840 
student picks up the pre-trip and the
backing<00:02:12.570> exercise<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.320> real<00:02:13.560> quick<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:14.580> we

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
backing exercise is real quick then we

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.880 
backing exercise is real quick then we
move<00:02:15.660> them<00:02:15.870> along<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.170> little<00:02:16.530> bit<00:02:16.650> quicker

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
move them along a little bit quicker

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580 
move them along a little bit quicker
then<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.450> another<00:02:18.810> student<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.350> doesn't

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
then it's another student that doesn't

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.800 
then it's another student that doesn't
