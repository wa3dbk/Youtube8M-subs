00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:16.279
 but then he is hardly to be seen there they put back then today he on Sunday 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.609
 4 And although he comes on television last act, the sender's beginning is that 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.199
 not good 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.390
 he prefers entry to San Siro 15 but of course on trade show days 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.000
 particular profile Modern West 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.529
 of course I apologize in advance 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.260
 the whole commentary is a symbolic end because it was for us 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.809
 Batman the Dark Knight started out who many of you got the movie 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.530
 wanted and that really from the first minute with the it 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.370
 Club has arrived, it is finally so far that I am particularly pleased that he 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.960
 This Sunday is on TV 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.610
 Well let alone or Batman the Dark Knight have his story 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.920
 superhero films like for themselves per day 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.089
 and he points out that even in this direction is a very special one 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.310
 Stuff Zidan Christopher Nolan the whole 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.830
 and Batman the Dark Knight the second day 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.310
 we do but i enjoy the whole thing has created a bit gloomy corner 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.460
 to determine the absolute dream job of the site 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.210
 He never said what I thought I saw with this movie in the cinema 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 has to fashionable best only on the threshold of a culprit like Batman against 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.240
 Joe fought and then 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 the well-known character called to a ceremony 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 the conductors 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.030
 where do we start? 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.270
 a year ago, these would have Santander he's never dared not 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 I assume what happened 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 and what she is like before he is one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 makes bets 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.320
 Being with 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 Princes "That's tough, everyone will own it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 I do not want to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.579
 This time is together again 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.389
 let's go on it does not matter because a bunch of 100 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.639
 this is important 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:21.079
 so it is, for example, which is uncertain provisional 8 078 no idea 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.419
 now Belize and countries have percent 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.529
 at the consumers 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.529
 good evening my feel 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.079
 the single will be 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.359
 I have now seen what I have to become to stop someone like him 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.639
 otherwise the night is in front of the house 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
 I do not promise them again 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.799
 the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 and here lies the 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.929
 as reported in the trade 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.839
 I will make sure 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.049
 Chr 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.979
 werder-striker 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
 if you live so long until you shock yourself 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.290
 they worsen the work's words as well in the broad daylight 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.769
 Churchill Lamborghini has 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 Vienna KAP are 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.799
 he all glories over a somewhat sombre variation of eventual eventuality 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.930
 that the theater is connected 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.980
 but on the whole, in both cases, the same as above, but one 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.990
 All the others have signed up, "Schopper says 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.659
 this year is expected 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.129
 Batman the Dark Knight is absolutely reliable for me 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.019
 Alone the old machines the miners must drive in the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.099
 Let rain chaos melt on your tongue that it's fresh value 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.459
 As the NDR would have the club Well that is a performance before you have the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.039
 Hat if you were not dead what percent are two separate 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.569
 The shooting of both the Cabinet of Doctor Parnassus would have died 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.469
 Percent one must say it is a very sad event story for everyone 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.110
 The movie is happy that Heath Ledger is not with us because he is wonderful 

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:33.389
 Performance and an absolutely great actor are the juke-r 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.519
 after all, for his presentation can lead us from because 

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:41.669
 this is a character that is easy and I think incredible Anderson 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.920
 to look incredibly great 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.850
 In addition we would have a free morning tomorrow Freeman who is always great 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.900
 given too 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.840
 and the Berenberg has 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.700
 therefore we have more and more about the use of a killed bit more 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.130
 but this CAS speaks for itself of this one also leads a certain 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.059
 rarely over two and a half hours 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.180
 it's easy 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.270
 he is and where she is fascinated from the first to the first 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.210
 last second 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.750
 the movie from whatever he needs it on it or does it all right 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.190
 Way blocked third Batman friend he is just a really big directors 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.949
 I even have the biggest in this world 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.819
 it's just nice to watch this company entertainment this movie has 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.819
 Fun this movie has actually gone far enough for that 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.900
 of sincerity and though all wrapped up in a superhero 5 that 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.319
 Burning is about it not so much with but so many 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.520
 little other things 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.720
 the delayed no to one of the best films that had and gets these complaints 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.199
 from me new unit of ten points 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.289
 Höller has therefore only hessian that this movie absolutely 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.430
 is less good 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.780
 because he did not quite congratulate me on this "Scream 4" Lötzsch 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.229
 that is achieved 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.210
 but the Fed let me go 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.139
 41 a foreign word technically 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.360
 Super also euro-bonds as I said either did not know them 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.270
 must see 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.949
 Batman the Dark Knight and her art on weekends
