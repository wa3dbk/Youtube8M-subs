how<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.099> execute<00:00:17.099> a<00:00:17.310> build<00:00:17.490> order<00:00:17.790> it's<00:00:18.689> gonna

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
how to execute a build order it's gonna

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
how to execute a build order it's gonna
be<00:00:18.930> nice<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.380> simple<00:00:19.740> let<00:00:19.950> me<00:00:20.119> get<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.239> build

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
be nice and simple let me get the build

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.749 
be nice and simple let me get the build
order<00:00:21.599> up<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.989> this<00:00:22.169> monitor<00:00:22.529> over<00:00:22.919> here<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
order up on this monitor over here and

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:24.950 
order up on this monitor over here and
we'll<00:00:23.970> start<00:00:24.239> the<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.509> and<00:00:24.720> we're<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we'll start the game and we're just

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.600 
we'll start the game and we're just
gonna<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.200> straight<00:00:25.470> into<00:00:25.649> this<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.009> idea<00:00:26.399> is

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
gonna go straight into this the idea is

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.609 
gonna go straight into this the idea is
just<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.180> instead<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:27.989> going<00:00:28.380> from

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
just to instead of just going from

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
just to instead of just going from
knowledge<00:00:29.040> we<00:00:29.220> want<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.579> try<00:00:29.759> and<00:00:29.939> practice

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
knowledge we want to try and practice

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.319 
knowledge we want to try and practice
the<00:00:31.050> Fu's<00:00:31.200> when<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.559> do<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.040> practically<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the Fu's when you do so practically then

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.889 
the Fu's when you do so practically then
you<00:00:33.809> pick<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.530> easier<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.899> we're

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you pick them up a lot easier so we're

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.029 
you pick them up a lot easier so we're
not<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.109> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.260> worrying<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.620> anything

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
not going to be worrying about anything

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.880 
not going to be worrying about anything
else<00:00:38.309> except<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.140> learning<00:00:40.140> how<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> execute

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
else except for learning how to execute

else except for learning how to execute
a<00:00:41.070> build<00:00:41.250> order<00:00:41.519> so<00:00:41.609> we're<00:00:41.699> not<00:00:41.760> gonna<00:00:41.879> worry

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a build order so we're not gonna worry

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.189 
a build order so we're not gonna worry
about<00:00:42.120> spreading<00:00:42.510> overloads<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.050> anything

build order we're gonna go ahead and
build<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.970> 9<00:01:06.240> Overlord<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.750> 9<00:01:06.930> supply<00:01:07.230> so<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
build a 9 Overlord on 9 supply so up to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
build a 9 Overlord on 9 supply so up to
9<00:01:07.950> supply<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.610> drones<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.990> we're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
9 supply now on drones and then we're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
9 supply now on drones and then we're
gonna<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.409> ahead<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.799> build<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.610> overlord<00:01:12.030> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gonna go ahead and build an overlord so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
gonna go ahead and build an overlord so
as<00:01:12.869> soon<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.110> you've<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.229> 100<00:01:13.860> minerals<00:01:14.159> we're

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
as soon as you've got 100 minerals we're

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940 
as soon as you've got 100 minerals we're
gonna<00:01:14.399> go<00:01:14.579> ahead<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.820> build<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.680> we'll

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
gonna go ahead and build that and we'll

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
gonna go ahead and build that and we'll
just<00:01:17.159> move<00:01:17.340> him<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:17.909> he's<00:01:18.329> not

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just move him out of the way so he's not

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929 
just move him out of the way so he's not
blocking<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.229> vision<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.369> hatchery<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
blocking our vision of the hatchery and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
blocking our vision of the hatchery and
then<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.570> next<00:01:21.899> one<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:22.380> 15<00:01:22.890> spawning<00:01:23.310> pools

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
then the next one is 15 spawning pools

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.889 
then the next one is 15 spawning pools
so<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.119> ahead<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.329> drone<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
so we're gonna go ahead and drone up to

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.929 
so we're gonna go ahead and drone up to
15<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:26.130> we'll<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.340> ahead<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.670> execute

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
15 and then we'll go ahead and execute

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
15 and then we'll go ahead and execute
out<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> rest<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> build<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> 16<00:01:28.380> hatchery

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Supply here we go 15 supply we need to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
Supply here we go 15 supply we need to
wait<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.600> 200<00:02:04.020> minerals<00:02:04.320> before<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> drop

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
wait for 200 minerals before we can drop

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800 
wait for 200 minerals before we can drop
the<00:02:05.189> spawning<00:02:05.460> pool<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.359> soon<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.689> do

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the spawning pool but as soon as we do

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.419 
the spawning pool but as soon as we do
we're<00:02:07.049> gonna<00:02:07.170> go<00:02:07.350> ahead<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> drop<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.340> we're

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
we're gonna go ahead and drop that we're

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.560 
we're gonna go ahead and drop that we're
gonna<00:02:08.520> move<00:02:08.700> him<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.910> couple<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.210> seconds

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
gonna move him a couple of seconds

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.270 
gonna move him a couple of seconds
earlier<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.320> get<00:02:10.890> him<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.130> position

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
earlier so we can get him into position

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610 
earlier so we can get him into position
then<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.820> go<00:02:12.030> ahead<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> drop<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.660> so

then we're gonna go ahead and drop it so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.110 
then we're gonna go ahead and drop it so
next<00:02:13.769> faction<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> build<00:02:14.730> order<00:02:14.940> is

next faction in the build order is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520 
next faction in the build order is
sixteen<00:02:15.540> hatcheries<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.230> gonna<00:02:16.319> wait

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
sixteen hatcheries so we're gonna wait

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160 
sixteen hatcheries so we're gonna wait
the<00:02:16.739> sixteen<00:02:17.430> supply<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:17.970> drones<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.930> drone

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the sixteen supply on drones just drone

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
the sixteen supply on drones just drone
it<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:20.370> we're<00:02:20.549> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:20.790> ahead<00:02:20.909> and

it up and we're going to go ahead and
drop<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.629> hatchery<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.799> natural<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.489> well

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
drop the hatchery as the natural as well

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.559 
drop the hatchery as the natural as well
because<00:02:23.819> we'll<00:02:23.970> always<00:02:24.120> want<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.480> be

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
because we'll always want to be

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.149 
because we'll always want to be
expanding<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.409> it<00:02:25.530> says<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> hatchery

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
expanding when it says get a hatchery

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.059 
expanding when it says get a hatchery
unless<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.879> says<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> macro<00:02:28.319> hatch<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.860> to

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
unless it says get a macro hatch and to

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.920 
unless it says get a macro hatch and to
time<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.400> out<00:02:29.580> well<00:02:29.819> we<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.629> send<00:02:30.840> the

time this out well we want to send the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.030 
time this out well we want to send the
drone<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.349> it's<00:02:31.470> about<00:02:31.620> two<00:02:31.920> hundred

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
drone when it's about two hundred

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
drone when it's about two hundred
minerals<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.150> clock<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.319> will

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
minerals on the clock and then it will

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
minerals on the clock and then it will
the<00:02:34.860> rest<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> drones<00:02:35.489> will<00:02:35.670> gather<00:02:35.849> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
the rest of the drones will gather the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.759 
the rest of the drones will gather the
hundred<00:02:36.390> minerals<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> time<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.409> moving

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
hundred minerals in the time it's moving

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.890 
hundred minerals in the time it's moving
down<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.579> natural<00:02:38.940> expansion<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.599> drop<00:02:39.780> that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
down to natural expansion to drop that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.210 
down to natural expansion to drop that
hatchery<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.440> here<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.739> go<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.069> three

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
hatchery so here we go is at three

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.589 
hatchery so here we go is at three
hundred<00:02:41.310> minerals<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.209> able<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.360> drop

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
hundred minerals now and be able to drop

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.509 
hundred minerals now and be able to drop
that<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:43.290> soon<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.620> he<00:02:43.680> gets<00:02:43.799> there<00:02:44.099> we<00:02:44.280> want<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
that as soon as he gets there we want to

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.520 
that as soon as he gets there we want to
put<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> hot<00:02:45.299> key<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
put that in the hot key and then the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.080 
put that in the hot key and then the
next<00:02:46.829> thing<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> build<00:02:47.459> order<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.879> to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
next thing in the build order is to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.180 
next thing in the build order is to
build<00:02:48.299> an<00:02:48.569> overlord<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.319> want<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.920> go<00:02:49.980> ahead

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
build an overlord so want to go ahead

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.530 
build an overlord so want to go ahead
and<00:02:50.310> build<00:02:50.459> Nova<00:02:50.730> law<00:02:50.819> just<00:02:51.060> move<00:02:51.209> him<00:02:51.359> over

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
and build Nova law just move him over

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.210 
and build Nova law just move him over
there<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.079> way<00:02:52.230> nice<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.829> easy<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
there out of the way nice and easy and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
there out of the way nice and easy and
then<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> next<00:02:54.090> action<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.810> build<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.079> queen

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
then the next action is to build a queen

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
then the next action is to build a queen
on<00:02:55.319> 15<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.280> after<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.790> build<00:02:57.030> an

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
on 15 and then after that build an

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.099 
on 15 and then after that build an
extract<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.690> 17<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.859> fifteen<00:02:59.579> Queen<00:03:00.109> 17

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
extract on 17 so fifteen Queen 17

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.140 
extract on 17 so fifteen Queen 17
extractor<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.310> we've<00:03:02.489> got<00:03:02.579> at<00:03:02.670> seventeen

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
extractor and now we've got at seventeen

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
extractor and now we've got at seventeen
zerglings<00:03:03.659> so<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:03.900> want<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.200> ahead<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
zerglings so we want to go ahead and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
zerglings so we want to go ahead and
build<00:03:04.709> another<00:03:05.069> drone<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.549> then<00:03:05.940> we're<00:03:06.090> gonna

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
build another drone and then we're gonna

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.330 
build another drone and then we're gonna
go<00:03:06.329> ahead<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.540> build<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.959> zergling<00:03:07.379> on<00:03:07.709> 17

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
go ahead and build a zergling on 17

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.089 
go ahead and build a zergling on 17
supply<00:03:08.700> put<00:03:09.299> him<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.510> our<00:03:09.599> hot<00:03:09.780> key<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.290> then

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
supply put him in our hot key and then

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.410 
supply put him in our hot key and then
what's<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> next<00:03:11.549> session<00:03:11.940> we've<00:03:12.030> got<00:03:12.120> 21

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
what's the next session we've got 21

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.539 
what's the next session we've got 21
Queen<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.079> drone<00:03:13.709> straight<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.310> 21<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
Queen so drone straight up to 21 and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.099 
Queen so drone straight up to 21 and
then<00:03:17.549> we'll<00:03:17.760> build<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.120> Queen<00:03:18.299> also<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
then we'll build that Queen also the

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.629 
then we'll build that Queen also the
assumed<00:03:19.500> things<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> talked<00:03:20.280> about<00:03:20.340> is

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
assumed things like I talked about is

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.870 
assumed things like I talked about is
putting<00:03:20.940> drones<00:03:21.299> in<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.599> extractor<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
putting drones in this extractor and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.240 
putting drones in this extractor and
also<00:03:23.880> injecting<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.750> Queens<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.530> they're

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
also injecting with Queens so they're

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.470 
also injecting with Queens so they're
not<00:03:26.400> written<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.880> build<00:03:27.030> order<00:03:27.269> but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
not written in the build order but

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.970 
not written in the build order but
they're<00:03:27.599> always<00:03:27.780> something<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.470> want<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.799> do

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
they're always something you want to do

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.440 
they're always something you want to do
just<00:03:29.250> put<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.489> drones<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.849> extractor<00:03:30.389> as

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
just put the drones on the extractor as

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.780 
just put the drones on the extractor as
soon<00:03:30.599> as<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.750> finishes<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.440> 21<00:03:32.280> supplying<00:03:32.639> us

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
soon as it finishes and 21 supplying us

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.069 
soon as it finishes and 21 supplying us
we<00:03:32.940> want<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> go<00:03:33.239> ahead<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.480> build<00:03:33.660> another

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
we want to go ahead and build another

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.199 
we want to go ahead and build another
queen<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.590> then<00:03:35.010> as<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.489> said<00:03:35.549> we<00:03:35.849> always<00:03:35.970> want

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
queen and then as I said we always want

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.300 
queen and then as I said we always want
to<00:03:36.239> be<00:03:36.329> injecting<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.139> go<00:03:37.680> ahead<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.980> inject

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
to be injecting so go ahead and inject

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.680 
to be injecting so go ahead and inject
with<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.760> if<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.209> real<00:03:39.419> game

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
with that and if this was a real game

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.940 
with that and if this was a real game
you'd<00:03:39.930> move<00:03:40.109> us<00:03:40.260> straight<00:03:40.500> down<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
you'd move us straight down to the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.680 
you'd move us straight down to the
natural<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.489> she<00:03:41.700> wants<00:03:41.879> to<00:03:41.940> go<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.540> down

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
natural because she wants to go go down

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.539 
natural because she wants to go go down
there<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.049> inject<00:03:43.379> there<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.680> well<00:03:43.829> but<00:03:44.400> I'm

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
there and inject there as well but I'm

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.000 
there and inject there as well but I'm
going<00:03:44.879> up<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.000> 24<00:03:45.690> supply<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.109> next<00:03:46.500> action<00:03:46.680> in

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
going up to 24 supply the next action in

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.150 
going up to 24 supply the next action in
the<00:03:47.129> build<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.579> Builder<00:03:47.910> 24<00:03:48.329> Overlord<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
the build is the Builder 24 Overlord and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.490 
the build is the Builder 24 Overlord and
then<00:03:50.160> after<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.669> 100%<00:03:51.180> Queen<00:03:51.660> build<00:03:52.109> an<00:03:52.260> EVO

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
then after that 100% Queen build an EVO

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.680 
then after that 100% Queen build an EVO
chamber<00:03:52.949> so<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.879> want<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> keep<00:03:54.209> droning

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
chamber so we just want to keep droning

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.470 
chamber so we just want to keep droning
until<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.799> Queen<00:03:56.040> pops<00:03:56.400> at<00:03:56.639> 100%<00:03:56.970> we'll<00:03:57.359> go

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
until the Queen pops at 100% we'll go

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.780 
until the Queen pops at 100% we'll go
ahead<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.780> build<00:03:57.900> an<00:03:58.019> EVO<00:03:58.260> chamber<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.980> you

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
ahead and build an EVO chamber and you

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.400 
ahead and build an EVO chamber and you
always<00:03:59.970> want<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.359> injecting<00:04:00.840> as<00:04:00.959> well<00:04:01.109> so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
always want to be injecting as well so

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.500 
always want to be injecting as well so
get<00:04:01.949> ready<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.190> inject<00:04:02.609> with<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:03.000> Queen<00:04:03.239> but

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
get ready to inject with this Queen but

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.849 
get ready to inject with this Queen but
other<00:04:03.900> than<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.530> keep<00:04:04.709> building

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
other than that just keep building

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.280 
other than that just keep building
drones<00:04:05.190> until<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:06.000> finishes<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.690> we'll

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
drones until this one finishes and we'll

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.289 
drones until this one finishes and we'll
go<00:04:07.379> ahead<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.680> inject<00:04:07.919> with<00:04:08.160> her<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.940> when

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
go ahead and inject with her and when

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.000 
go ahead and inject with her and when
she<00:04:09.329> Potts<00:04:09.720> will<00:04:09.930> inject<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.620> then<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.829> build

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
she Potts will inject and then we build

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.319 
she Potts will inject and then we build
that<00:04:11.129> Evo<00:04:11.400> chamber<00:04:11.849> because<00:04:12.150> we've<00:04:12.299> just

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
that Evo chamber because we've just

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.569 
that Evo chamber because we've just
reached<00:04:12.660> 100%<00:04:13.169> of<00:04:13.440> Queen<00:04:13.650> she<00:04:13.889> popped<00:04:14.099> out<00:04:14.310> and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
reached 100% of Queen she popped out and

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.490 
reached 100% of Queen she popped out and
there<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.269> we've<00:04:15.930> got<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.169> build<00:04:16.320> order

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
there we go we've got the build order

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.319 
there we go we've got the build order
done<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.919> hopefully<00:04:17.280> that'll<00:04:17.459> help<00:04:17.880> solidify

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
done and hopefully that'll help solidify

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.379 
done and hopefully that'll help solidify
you<00:04:19.289> know<00:04:19.410> how<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.769> execute<00:04:20.729> Burrell<00:04:21.000> orders

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
you know how to execute Burrell orders

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.719 
you know how to execute Burrell orders
and<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.770> make<00:04:22.890> your<00:04:22.979> own<00:04:23.039> bill<00:04:23.310> doors<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and you can make your own bill doors and

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.850 
and you can make your own bill doors and
just<00:04:23.909> do<00:04:24.030> like<00:04:24.210> two<00:04:24.840> or<00:04:24.960> three<00:04:24.990> until<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.680> feel

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
just do like two or three until you feel

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.629 
just do like two or three until you feel
really<00:04:26.159> calm

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
really calm

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.399 
really calm
