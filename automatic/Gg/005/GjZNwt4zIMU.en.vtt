00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 welcome to tripolis ev 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.220
 today will show you how to galaxy 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 s3 mini the glass with the displays full 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.280
 traffic that no more scratches here 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.750
 looks and amazed penetrate no 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.099
 This repair is extremely difficult 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.570
 and should not be done by a beginner 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.620
 you should try it anyway 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 you can find below in a video 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.890
 Description left to spare parts and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 tools that I also use 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.470
 just go through so take it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.630
 tools the hand and let us 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:29.310
 get started before we should start 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.849
 necessarily the following things at hand 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.650
 to have 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 cleaning cloth spirit or isopropanol 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 then you should do a commercial uv 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.170
 lamp for gel or acrylic nails 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.090
 then glue the port ready for use 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 we display at the top and bottom 1 2 mm 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 thin double sided adhesive tape on 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 You should not know how to do that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 remove glass then I will in the end 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.410
 the video all the important information and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 link to videos and in the video 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 Post description when you are done 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 now remove the protective foil from the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.949
 double-sided adhesive tape next 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.480
 Let's stick another layer 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.500
 tape over it and build one with it 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 little ladies with it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.649
 superfluous glue only on the sides 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.149
 print out and not to the electronics 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.379
 if you get too much liquid glue 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 have done that on now 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 Display with a microfiber cloth and with 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 Air pressure from dust and grease stains 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 liberate so now comes the difficult 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.450
 part from now works in slow motion the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 means extremely slow 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360
 we are now taking the luca uv glue 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 hand and let it slow and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.930
 Carefully in a bone shape or 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.340
 two adjacent y form flow 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.340
 so that no air bubbles arise 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.360
 You should be between 1.5 and 1.7 grams 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.710
 I personally use stickers 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.299
 user prefer a little more glue which 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.619
 later pages call out flows as to 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.890
 little to install and bubbles 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.180
 take risk 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.590
 so now comes the critical point 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.450
 First of all you remove all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.619
 then lays new track protection foils 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.640
 her the glass with the bottom side 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.630
 first without touching the glue 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.340
 then you hold with a flat 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 fixed the glass on top and let it go 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 Slip it down gently until contact 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.320
 with the glue here should be on it 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.119
 Make sure that there are no bubbles 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.409
 should it happen then just that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.850
 Lift the glass again and blow the bubbles 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.350
 just burst and definitely not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 try to blow the air later 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.740
 push around on the glass to remove 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.329
 this is definitely in the pants 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 Now the glass goes down 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.869
 move the flat object 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 her glass reached the bottom 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.469
 is then very careful and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.770
 evenly apply the glue to the strings 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.770
 to press 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.810
 as soon as the glue is in front of it 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.700
 You have to reach the corners now 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.379
 uv lamp on and then the glass 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.090
 Press firmly underneath until the glue is off 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.069
 Corner reached and then the pressure something 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 but take away the finger on it 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.250
 let and between times every now and then 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.870
 Check again if bubbles are forming 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 that should be the case the pressure 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.019
 but do not raise so hard that the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.599
 glue over our ladies in the 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.640
 Electronics will flow after 30 seconds 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.500
 the upper side should be firm 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.370
 so now we turn the phone and do 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.900
 exactly the same on the other side 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 then the galaxy for three to five 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.090
 minutes under the lamp completely hard 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.530
 let be 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.910
 then the leaked 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 remove glue as the glue 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.910
 you should persist your spirit 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.860
 nail polish remover or isopropanol 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.360
 but that can use one 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.340
 lasts until all the glue remains from the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.209
 Glass are removed as last check 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.680
 we still do everything right 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.150
 now you can have your galaxy 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.989
 enjoy again without dust 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 can penetrate 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.230
 so people i hope i could give you 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.670
 further we have should still upwards 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.810
 you can trust the repair 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.459

 peruse on these since the art 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.700
 the glass repairs on the other 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.290
 side it comes to further samsung 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.670
