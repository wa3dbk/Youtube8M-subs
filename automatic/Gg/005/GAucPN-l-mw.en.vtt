00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800 
three seconds goodness
it's<00:03:20.609> quite<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> nice<00:03:21.000> bring<00:03:21.239> down<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.600> low<00:03:21.780> as

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it's quite a nice bring down as low as

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's quite a nice bring down as low as
this<00:03:22.140> though<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:22.799> seeing<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
this though because I like seeing the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.910 
this though because I like seeing the
wind<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.390> rip<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.079> waves<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.590> front<00:03:25.799> of

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
wind just rip on the waves in front of

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
wind just rip on the waves in front of
you<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:29.030> imagine<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.150> ever-changing<00:03:30.359> this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
you I imagine it's ever-changing this

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.690 
you I imagine it's ever-changing this
cosine<00:03:31.319> isn't<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.709> yeah<00:03:32.069> because<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.430> always

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
cosine isn't it yeah because I always

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.250 
cosine isn't it yeah because I always
see<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.120> different<00:03:33.510> times<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.049> day<00:03:34.230> so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
see it at different times of the day so

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.099 
see it at different times of the day so
it's<00:03:34.739> different<00:03:35.010> types<00:03:35.459> different<00:03:36.299> lights<00:03:36.780> so

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
it's different types different lights so

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's different types different lights so
I'm<00:03:37.200> always<00:03:37.380> spotting<00:03:37.859> new<00:03:38.160> stuff<00:03:39.079> okay<00:03:40.079> Joe
