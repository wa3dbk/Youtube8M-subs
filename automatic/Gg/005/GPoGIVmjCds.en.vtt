00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
but we're going to imagine for the sake

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.120 
but we're going to imagine for the sake
of<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:50.950> video<00:00:51.130> that<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.780> wasn't<00:00:53.020> just<00:00:53.980> going

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
to pull this off so there we go

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.080 
to pull this off so there we go
no<00:00:59.860> red<00:01:00.070> mark<00:01:00.280> right<00:01:00.520> now<00:01:00.700> but<00:01:00.910> we're<00:01:01.030> just

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
no red mark right now but we're just

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.560 
no red mark right now but we're just
going<00:01:01.330> to<00:01:01.420> say<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.690> there<00:01:01.810> was<00:01:01.960> one<00:01:02.400> so
