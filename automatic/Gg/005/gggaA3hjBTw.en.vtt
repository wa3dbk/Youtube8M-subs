00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 et the extraterrestrial for atari 2600 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 they had to be a platform game 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 but given the short time that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 they had to develop it they decided 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.010
 make this milestone reported that it has 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.539
 become the worst game of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 history and that was one of the causes 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.230
 of the company's economic woes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.159

 send eggs analyzing the game we 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.999
 we find before a green penis 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.870
 the cage lille graphic environment of the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.569
 few benefits that the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 atari 2600 is lousy with a perspective 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.949
 impossible and without any sense 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.569
 the green penis we will call etc. it walks 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.720
 around the world with holes in which 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.979
 we fall and fall and fall and we become 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 to fall and in those that count 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 Sometimes we find pieces that form 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.140
 an interplanetary phone for 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060
