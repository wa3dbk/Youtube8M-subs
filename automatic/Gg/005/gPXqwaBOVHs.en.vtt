00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello to the bundesliga day after 28 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.799
 Spielag with her colleague Thorsten Mesch 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.750
 Hello Thorsten, we both have that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 Weekend also accompanied in the newsroom 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 have the bundesliga next 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 looked at and most exciting 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 certainly in the fight for relegation and you can 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.720
 the impression the hsv has 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.760
 abandoned after what yesterday 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 Everything has not just given up 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.740
 but they tear themselves apart 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 gives a fight in the cabin on the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.960
 made a hair-raising mistake 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.360
 there is no reaction no rearing 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.219
 yes it they are in a space 18 since the vfb 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 stuttgart has won and they have 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.520
 shown how to do it 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.469
 descent fight the one pure skin 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 also in match time or stop in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.600
 the final stage is over 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 Paderborn has also shown that they are 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.329
 now slipped up to 16th place 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.399
 and if the trend continues 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.539
 hsv not to save 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 you also have the impression of everyone else 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.660
 Still fighting for the last blade of grass only 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 the hsv that is not already 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.539
 adventurously weak like that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.969
 team is presenting right now 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.799
 under peter knacks and what's added 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.060
 were was obviously confirmed 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.409
 also the cabs fight between 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 behrami and djourou 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.350
 that actually speaks volumes for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 me it is dissolution phenomena 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 at the HSV everyone-against-everyone actually 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 I have if if if two 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.270
 as an aggressive leader or 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.280
 performance provider for the team 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 are then brought each other 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 beat up and instead of the people 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 take with you and on the place the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.720
 pretend direction 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 then not too much is too much 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 Rescue in the team we light up 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 the topic of course today at sport1 de 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.040
 and also at bundesliga aktuell today 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 evening from 18 o'clock 30 in the tv 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 There you will certainly be more 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 learn to the question when will come thomas 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.610
 Tuchel he ever comes to hamburg 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 he comes in the same way as yesterday 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 double pass were demanded we are there 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.799
 latest information 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.579
 out 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.409
 a team does not have to be good either 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.810
 running is borussia dortmund 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.460
 The criticism is getting louder and more special 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 jÃ¼rgen klopp but also at the team 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.480
 one has the impression that 's not true 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 more among each other this 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 verbal argument between 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.190
 sebastian kehl and jÃ¼rgen klopp all 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 was on the field was 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.270
 somewhere exemplary how do you see the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.190
 situation in dortmund just the two have 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 which is now said true belittled 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.840
 it ticked off but of course it shows that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.030
 it somewhere is not true dortmund has 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.890
 also totally overslept the state again 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.150
 in gladbach has clearly the limits 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.220
 be shown 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.780
 You can see that the team stops in the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 moment not the potential has up 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 play along 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.960
 Something has to happen there 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.490
 Some people already with them 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.480
 Emigration or loud 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.060
 have thought about how to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.070
 example hummels windows maybe what 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.330
 better if the actual still 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.130
 leave time the club that if you 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.840
 Kat is the other alternative 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.580
 Of course the coach would say I have 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 now my job is done or the bvb 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.840
 The consequence is that it just stops 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.340
 What you decide there yourself 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.100
 you have to be able to do that from the outside 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.690
 not much to say but you have to 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.970
 In any case, the impression that somewhere 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.230
 Now an era has come to an end 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.400
 It will not be a champions league 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.670
 probably not played either 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.020
 europe league and then it is just stop 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.830
 the soft for the new season 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.800
 adjust 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.480
 the future, thorsten also thanks
