of<00:00:59.730> Arsenal<00:01:00.090> yeah<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.539> it'd<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of Arsenal yeah I think it'd make a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
of Arsenal yeah I think it'd make a
great<00:01:01.170> captain<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.219> prefer

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
great captain but I would prefer

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
great captain but I would prefer
probably<00:01:02.820> Mertesacker<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> captain

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
probably Mertesacker to be the captain

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
probably Mertesacker to be the captain
because<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.559> I've<00:01:04.680> seen<00:01:04.860> him<00:01:05.010> play<00:01:05.129> he's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
because when I've seen him play he's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.590 
because when I've seen him play he's
always<00:01:05.489> trying<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> push<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> team<00:01:06.299> forward

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
always trying to push the team forward

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
always trying to push the team forward
and<00:01:06.930> he's<00:01:07.260> always<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.680> trying<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and he's always just trying to get the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
and he's always just trying to get the
best<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> people<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.970> remember<00:01:09.240> one

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
you like that no not for me we didn't
really<00:01:36.540> add<00:01:36.840> projeto<00:01:37.439> sure<00:01:37.770> because<00:01:37.920> he's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
really add projeto sure because he's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
really add projeto sure because he's
like<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> Steven<00:01:40.829> Gerrard

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like more of like the Steven Gerrard

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
like more of like the Steven Gerrard
type<00:01:41.340> player<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.479> club<00:01:42.720> man

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
type player where he was a one club man

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.289 
type player where he was a one club man
so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:44.040> he<00:01:44.700> should<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.000> our<00:01:45.119> captain

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
Ramsay's in the you captain yeah I think

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.020 
Ramsay's in the you captain yeah I think
he's<00:02:36.740> been<00:02:36.860> pretty<00:02:37.040> good<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.370> season<00:02:37.730> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
he's been pretty good this season and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.540 
he's been pretty good this season and
well<00:02:38.360> last<00:02:38.570> season<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:39.020> think<00:02:39.650> he'll<00:02:40.130> they'll

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
well last season I think he'll they'll

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.250 
well last season I think he'll they'll
probably<00:02:40.700> solve<00:02:41.270> I'd<00:02:41.420> step<00:02:41.660> up<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.050> role

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
probably solve I'd step up to that role

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.340 
probably solve I'd step up to that role
quite<00:02:42.980> well<00:02:43.250> he's<00:02:44.060> been<00:02:44.240> doing<00:02:44.510> quite<00:02:45.230> well

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
quite well he's been doing quite well

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.800 
quite well he's been doing quite well
for<00:02:45.470> Wales<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.160> well<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.360> all<00:02:47.570> role

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
for Wales as well and that's all role

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.550
