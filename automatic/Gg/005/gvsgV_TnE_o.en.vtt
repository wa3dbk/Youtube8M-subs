this<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.160> item<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
this this item you can also see that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
this this item you can also see that
it's<00:01:04.290> cdma<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> look<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's cdma if you look to the right in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800 
it's cdma if you look to the right in
the<00:01:06.390> middle<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> cdma<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the middle there it's a cdma the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.270 
the middle there it's a cdma the
technology<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> means<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.159> on

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
technology that means that it's not on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
technology that means that it's not on
the<00:01:11.400> old<00:01:11.659> idea<00:01:12.659> network<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.470> new

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the old idea network it's on the new

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.690 
the old idea network it's on the new
cdma<00:01:14.490> network<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> sprint<00:01:16.340> sprint<00:01:17.340> our

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cdma network which is sprint sprint our

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.960 
cdma network which is sprint sprint our
sprint<00:01:18.180> coverage<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.670> better

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
sprint coverage so it's much much better

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
sprint coverage so it's much much better
about<00:01:21.659> 20<00:01:22.080> times<00:01:22.259> faster<00:01:22.409> internet<00:01:23.159> speed<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
about 20 times faster internet speed and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.649 
about 20 times faster internet speed and
then<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> original<00:01:24.720> old<00:01:25.170> walkie-talkie<00:01:25.890> i

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
then the original old walkie-talkie i

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
then the original old walkie-talkie i
dint<00:01:27.659> phones<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.560> sim<00:01:29.040> card<00:01:29.280> in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
dint phones that have the sim card in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
dint phones that have the sim card in
them<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:31.380> newer<00:01:32.570> boost<00:01:33.570> blackberrys

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
them so these newer boost blackberrys

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
them so these newer boost blackberrys
will<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> sim<00:01:35.490> cards<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
will not have the sim cards in the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.289 
will not have the sim cards in the
bonita<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.619> aware<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
bonita will this one so be aware of that

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
bonita will this one so be aware of that
perfectly<00:01:39.299> normal<00:01:39.950> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> receive<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
blackberry that does have a sim card in

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
blackberry that does have a sim card in
if<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> means<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> old<00:01:44.909> slow<00:01:45.509> I'd

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
if that means you're on the old slow I'd

but<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> I've<00:02:17.840> described<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.050> item<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:19.710> going

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
but so I've described the item I'm going

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.550 
but so I've described the item I'm going
to<00:02:20.040> give<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> comparison<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
to give you a comparison here what it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790 
to give you a comparison here what it
looks<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.670> original<00:02:24.240> color<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.410> dark

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
looks like the original color is a dark

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.690 
looks like the original color is a dark
gray<00:02:26.190> very<00:02:26.820> dark<00:02:27.980> hold<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.160> gun<00:02:29.430> metal<00:02:29.820> gray<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
gray very dark hold a gun metal gray and

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.970 
gray very dark hold a gun metal gray and
so<00:02:32.700> that's<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.120> normal<00:02:33.450> color<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.800> see

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so that's the normal color you can see

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.910 
so that's the normal color you can see
the<00:02:35.100> contrast<00:02:35.580> between<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:37.380> new<00:02:37.590> white

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the contrast between the the new white

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.270 
the contrast between the the new white
housing<00:02:38.490> full<00:02:39.420> housing<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.990> media<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
housing full housing and media and the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.560 
housing full housing and media and the
original<00:02:41.640> great<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.770> obviously

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
original great so this is obviously

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.940 
original great so this is obviously
really<00:02:45.570> sharp<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.260> unique<00:02:46.650> looking

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
really sharp and really unique looking

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
really sharp and really unique looking
but<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.240> housing<00:02:51.660> has<00:02:51.840> been

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
but because the the housing has been

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.520 
but because the the housing has been
upgraded<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:53.220> no<00:02:53.400> longer<00:02:53.430> shows<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.530> metal

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
