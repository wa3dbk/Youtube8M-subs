like<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> that's<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.210> can

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
like that and that's because you can

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.700

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.969 

however<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.600> are<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.749> few<00:01:42.049> bad<00:01:42.380> points<00:01:42.799> about

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
however there are a few bad points about

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.399 
however there are a few bad points about
it<00:01:43.039> which<00:01:43.539> is<00:01:44.539> that<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.869> material<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:45.380> made

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
it which is that the material it's made

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.910 
it which is that the material it's made
out<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:46.069> very<00:01:46.490> very<00:01:46.819> soft<00:01:47.679> which<00:01:48.679> means

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
out of is very very soft which means

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.499 
out of is very very soft which means
that<00:01:49.009> whenever<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.490> drop<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.030> get<00:01:50.210> quite

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that whenever you drop it you get quite

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.380 
that whenever you drop it you get quite
about<00:01:50.750> Vince<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.710> things<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:53.270> all

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
about Vince and things in it and all

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.059 
about Vince and things in it and all
across<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.869> edge<00:01:53.959> here<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.500> I'm<00:01:54.709> not<00:01:54.740> sure<00:01:54.979> if

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
across the edge here and I'm not sure if

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.580 
across the edge here and I'm not sure if
you<00:01:55.159> can<00:01:55.219> see<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.490> very<00:01:55.609> well<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.380> all

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
you can see it very well but it's all

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.719 
you can see it very well but it's all
chewed<00:01:57.979> up<00:01:58.869> which<00:01:59.869> isn't<00:02:00.349> very<00:02:00.380> useful<00:02:00.729> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
chewed up which isn't very useful and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.580 
chewed up which isn't very useful and
also<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.420> drop<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:02.780> mud<00:02:03.020> then<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.439> mud

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
also if you drop it in mud then the mud

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.870 
also if you drop it in mud then the mud
gets<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:03.920> crack<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.459> then<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.670> won't<00:02:04.819> look

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
gets and the crack so then it won't look

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.749 
gets and the crack so then it won't look
good<00:02:04.939> when<00:02:05.299> you're<00:02:05.450> doing<00:02:06.349> it<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:06.590> I'll<00:02:07.399> say

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759
