00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 a greeting warriors on the occasion of the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 gold cup we started a series of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.410
 opinion programs by experts 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.389
 journalists we want to have your 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.179
 collaboration to know what you think of the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.179
 step of the tri in the golden cup we started 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 in our first program we have 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 a luxury commentator Fernando Suarez 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.890
 a pleasure to be with you in warriors 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.720
 Aztecs within this golden cup no 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.180
 There is no doubt that it is the highest gold cup 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.309
 obligation for the Mexican team is 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.860
 a gold cup where there is no margin of 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.600
 mistake a gold cup that puts the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.940
 maximum pressure to the technical director 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.470
 Miguel Herrera, having elected the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 best players to be 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.760
 representing Mexico in this 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.440
 competition and leaving a second plane 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.140
 in an American Cup that turned out to be 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.449
 expensive that mexico start the glass of 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.970
 gold located at number 40 of the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.979
 ranking of the fifa is not indicative of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.020
 which is more bad is simply 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.060
 indicative that the scores have 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.030
 dropped when the results have not 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 accompanied in this year of 2015 all 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.159
 the selections of the world have a ups 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.049
 and low but that of the Mexican team has 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.720
 been very strong after all that 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.300
 enthusiasm for everything that he deluded under 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.710
 the command of the old now carlos candles 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.820
 becomes the great reference of 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.560
 team 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.290
 and you must finally take out all your 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.150
 potential jonathan do santo receives his 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 first great opportunity with the team 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.340
 National Héctor Herrera does not go to 100 and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.440
 possibly bank start saved 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.830
 is in the best moment of his career 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.740
 miguel layún is guarantee diego kings and 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.810
 me a lot in rhythm will come to add teak 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.360
 tito crowns a player who does the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.250
 difference we will see how they behave 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.140
 Aztec warriors in this golden cup 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.600
 because of the behavior that they 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.590
 have much to depend on the fate of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.740
 Mexican soccer 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.550
 until next time we would like to have 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.590
 your opinion 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.240
 today we ask you about who is 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.880
 your favorite team to win the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.300
 gold cup and what player will the embi ask 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.300
 the cup 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.299
 well my name is andrés espinoza and 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.739
 Well, my opinion is that it's a tournament 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.830
 where the true level of 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.400
 the concacaf obviously my team is 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.110
 mexico and my player to follow will be 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.750
 Carlos sailing not in the favorite team is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.120
 mexico but he wins 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.180
 the best player of opinions 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.080
 is durable like carlos vela de 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.659
 another planet 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.819
 jonathan dos saints awesome the 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.280
 better means of containment than doctor 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.840
 and could not have for several years 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.989
 when you saw on the preparation tour 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 from mexico the favorite team is without a doubt 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.650
 USA East and the player 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.290
 Carlos Candle is the player who can most 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.080
 change the pace of a match and the one 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.819
 more unbalanced has it seems to me that the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.440
 best edge cup player is Carlos 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.930
 sail undoubtedly is a player who 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.150
 mark difference of the playing field and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 the favorite team I think is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.519
 mexico for the body individualities 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.160
 All in all I think it's superior to 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.430
 of the area but this has to be 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.080
 play are 11 against 11 in warriors 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.640
 Aztecs we always like to have a little 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 of humor that crown gives us that touch 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.099
 for the next program we want that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.170
 help miguel herrera to make 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.390
 the eleven of the cup we want you to be 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.310

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.299

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.340
