00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
the narration from all four characters I

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.850 
the narration from all four characters I

this<00:06:10.009> episode<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.460> really<00:06:11.060> think<00:06:11.270> it<00:06:11.599> did<00:06:11.780> the

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
this episode I really think it did the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.050 
this episode I really think it did the
show<00:06:12.080> justice<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.889> wasn't<00:06:13.250> really<00:06:13.490> corny<00:06:14.030> I

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
show justice it wasn't really corny I

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.459 
show justice it wasn't really corny I
thought<00:06:14.419> there's<00:06:14.659> some<00:06:14.930> actually<00:06:15.229> really

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
thought there's some actually really

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.879 
thought there's some actually really
good<00:06:15.590> acting<00:06:16.009> moments<00:06:16.430> especially<00:06:16.580> with<00:06:17.889> sam

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
good acting moments especially with sam

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.010 
good acting moments especially with sam
witwer<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.460> Sam<00:06:19.639> Huntington<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.449> thought<00:06:20.840> they

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
witwer and Sam Huntington I thought they

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.749 
witwer and Sam Huntington I thought they
did<00:06:21.199> some<00:06:21.349> great<00:06:21.680> a<00:06:21.919> great<00:06:22.400> job<00:06:22.580> especially

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
did some great a great job especially

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.360 
did some great a great job especially
when<00:06:23.419> I<00:06:23.750> again<00:06:24.169> that<00:06:24.349> coward<00:06:24.770> Xena<00:06:25.099> thought

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
when I again that coward Xena thought

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.820 
when I again that coward Xena thought
was<00:06:25.490> amazing<00:06:26.060> um<00:06:26.330> so<00:06:27.199> I<00:06:27.229> didn't<00:06:27.529> really<00:06:27.620> think

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
was amazing um so I didn't really think

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.950 
was amazing um so I didn't really think
it<00:06:27.919> was<00:06:27.979> corny

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
it was corny

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.629 
it was corny
then<00:06:29.139> I<00:06:29.470> didn't<00:06:29.860> think<00:06:29.949> it<00:06:30.069> was<00:06:30.130> predictable

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
then I didn't think it was predictable

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.090 
then I didn't think it was predictable
which<00:06:30.819> a<00:06:30.940> lot<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.180> finales<00:06:31.660> end<00:06:31.870> up<00:06:32.020> being<00:06:32.289> um<00:06:33.039> I

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
which a lot of finales end up being um I

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.650 
which a lot of finales end up being um I
thought<00:06:33.580> there<00:06:33.789> is<00:06:33.910> enough<00:06:34.210> predictability

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
thought there is enough predictability

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.320 
thought there is enough predictability
like<00:06:35.560> you<00:06:35.770> know<00:06:35.919> an<00:06:36.069> orang<00:06:36.370> Josh<00:06:36.639> and<00:06:36.910> having

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
happily ever after but there's enough

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.830 
happily ever after but there's enough
saying<00:06:39.430> oh<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.610> didn't<00:06:39.910> really<00:06:40.000> see<00:06:40.090> that<00:06:40.449> but<00:06:40.660> I
