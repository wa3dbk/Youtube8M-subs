00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.770
 Hi everyone guys and I have come 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 being tv today I'm here with jtf pub 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 beautiful and today we are here to bring you that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.949
 which in my opinion is one of the best 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.769
 gameplay that have never been made 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.930
 in the field of pop stomp in Italian 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's introduce it to pub that the author 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 of the gameplay ok guys then this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.530
 gameplay here many that you or better 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.630
 I hope not too many have already seen it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.309
 because it was loaded up front 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 a few days ago on my channel has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.579
 anyway it has been quite successful 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.460
 was seen by foams and 1,500 people 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.160
 then this field and I realized it 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 a week ago precise with 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 the event of double points therefore was 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 the introduction of nuketown and there was bonus 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.010
 practically the mode where you could 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 already lost the canton show however 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 During those three days I realized 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 two other good gameplay in solo ho 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 took this a little chance for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 to prove it was because they were Dominican 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 on call on skype with re timing 2000 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.330
 as you will remember, it is precisely for the former 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.130
 more or less five minutes we didn't talk 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.090
 so there was also the problem is a little 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.829
 the skype call and so on after there was 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.450
 this unit four cousins a tan e 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 I see that I do the first nuclear with 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.220
 still 12 and a half minutes I mean also 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.770
 I read good lay for another 12 months and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.710
 half suicide me try another core a 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 9 minutes I had the second heck doctor 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.110
 there is still nine minutes and I've done it already 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 two nuclei now committed suicide between the second 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 and the third nuclear I practically have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.540
 had some difficulties having it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.540
 we say, however, prevented more or less a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.909
 minute and a half of time to make kg of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.530
 row of doing a good series are a lot 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.500
 more or less he failed four times 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.630
 to do more than two pounds in a row, and so on 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 then after a certain point said enough 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.649
 now I focus is everything 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.209
 what was in my head is you 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.830
 set aside to make room only 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.320
 this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.820
 match the last eight minutes of 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.640
 game 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.470
 I was born in Syria I did no 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.570
 cut a little bit short even if I am 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.340
 already doing too long done 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.980
 a roofed clergy is at that point 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.010
 however, and milan were already on call 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.650
 I felt we were talking like that and I said 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.040
 made done the other 3 plexus presses 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.830
 remember www1 then I say cacchio sapri 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.520
 minutes my companions conquer the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.580
 fuji therefore really moments of tension 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.420
 you could cut the tension with a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 wire 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 I remember so blind man roll me 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.950
 I was waiting for the enemies 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.590
 conquered the captured fuji in 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 previously in the partner so that when 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 the catch is not two minutes and 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.570
 fifty 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.230
 now I don't remember well I knew about salt 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.660
 coming he pulled the vizard and I go into 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.060
 series almost immediately a 1000 immediately I do 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.690
 one thing thrown away the beginning I do some 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.100
 gem etc etc arrival 20 thousand and already 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.200
 previously I was in the game 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.500
 lucky several times as an image or 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.150
 you will see and arrive twenty pulls and la 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 voltage was really very high 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.620
 so gabry or to confirm why it is 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 also called him without much more weight 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.450
 or less than I get 27 in a row me 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.430
 I lean over for a moment 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.269
 on the soldier's side he will fit mad 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.470
 I see myself as a still enemy is now like a god 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.420
 as I said in my previous 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.950
 in my previous comment I thought 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 she was one in peace 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.330
 I see myself holding a 3 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.709
 attack that actually starts immediately 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.069
 I don't know how I did it because of that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.230
 quickly eni mia I saw myself three 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.390
 attack 30 centimeters away from 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.910
 I test my character I do n't know how I got it 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.190
 made to survive from what I have 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.379
 understood sought a companion near me I 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.480
 but quite safe more than anything else 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.640
 the fact that I had anti-splinters on me 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.360
 they saved the state from sleeping 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.860
 together 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.110
 crashed has no direct impact 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.310
 but close but it is indeed done at the end 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.200
 over the institute and I managed to do 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.579
 this fills so there are so many 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.070
 other stories, however, I see that we are already 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.260
 too many minutes 4 minutes to commit e 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.690
 leaves no word cup and yes as you will 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 understood from this long introduction that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.270
 looks like the thing in something chrono 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.000
 historian as slow as in slow motion 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.039
 you will have understood that it is the quad 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.289
 of a floor only is the first performed 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.940
 in Italy, however, we have already spoken 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.880
 we are already very many at the gameplay 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
 over 4 minutes then I would start aa 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.470
 talk about what is the juice of 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.240
 This says you may have heard them 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.919
 that the pub voice does not come at all 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 new though for some you might 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.919
 be the new voice 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.740
 in fact this is the reintroduction here 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.250
 of pubs that had already been in our club 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.060
 previously then decided for 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.490
 his reasons for leaving the clan e 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.840
 join the snai clan 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.380
 a few days ago that we say here is 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.979
 the gist of the commentaries we gdf and sly 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.560
 we made a kind of union 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.599
 what does this mean that reads of f 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.000
 we asked some members of the 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.770
 we basically gave everyone 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.470
 the opportunity to all those who still 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.050
 to be gameplay we say appropriate for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.360
 enter to enter precisely to do 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.129
 part of our club 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.960
 this proposal was accepted by 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.939
 several members you may have already heard 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.340
 the video of the slide clan and then 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.889
 you'll also know who I'm talking about 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.050
 which you will see later, however 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.250
 their introduce singh with on the channel 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.990
 that this is the main juice of the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.090
 commenting on them we say this novelty that is 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.460
 ours that expands anyway 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.770
 we took as many as seven players 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.110
 so at the moment let's say it's one 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.909
 great expansion how this was born 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.699
 idea idea came from zodiak merit that 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.310
 they were never call we decided for 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.069
 the note to opt for this union 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.469
 make this proposal 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:16.789
 zodiac precisely called the various 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:19.400
 members that we were interested in 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:22.370
 jdf we have made this proposal 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.389
 they have all accepted precisely 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.800
 and nothing so we are here to do 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.539
 this video to explain precisely 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.589
 this happened considering that anyway 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.759
 this one is the back of a pub singh 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:36.409
 some of you may not know it 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.509
 since the pub was in the clan 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.879
 if I'm not mistaken until January you're more or 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.860
 less so maybe some of you don't 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.039
 they know and I would give them a little time 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.360
 word to do let's say things tudini 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.770
 presentations etc. go ahead you go 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.599
 I don't have much time with kids 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.620
 I think most of you do 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.940
 they will already know by cutting short 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.219
 Swiss this 17 years my name is 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.569
 alexander for those who do not 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.339
 they knew in switzerland they also spoke 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.560
 Italian so I wasn't born in 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.300
 Italy I have always lived in Switzerland and 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.949
 Swiss is not spoken in Switzerland 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.650
 exactly the Swiss is not spoken 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.990
 remember I started playing with mv 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.310
 2 even if contemporary was already out 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.979
 m3 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.770
 then later up more or less a year ago not 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.289
 I was neither on youtube nor any 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.389
 console started to run mine 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.520
 paxton career for a year at this 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.909
 part so I already made a good one 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.310
 path so far I think therefore can nothing 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.599
 not always what else to say if also 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.219
 because anyway some business 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.009
 adding to the term we are almost 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:39.680
 arrived at the fourth nueter then nothing 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.630
 boys if the video you liked me 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.919
 to leave a like because anyway 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.310
 this gameplay is really cool 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.680
 I invite you to get 600 600 likes 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.509
 if we succeed because this gameplay is 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.970
 just fantastic and the first in 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.669
 even of nuclear queues 

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.810
 Only and therefore nothing left written 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.090
