00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
why he did it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
why he did it

he's shake hands come on shaky where the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730 
he's shake hands come on shaky where the
tackles<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:51.090> bad<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> saw<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.560> saw<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
tackles that bad that you saw we saw the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
tackles that bad that you saw we saw the
Alonso<00:01:53.220> tackle<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.729> probably<00:01:54.570> should<00:01:54.810> have

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
Alonso tackle that probably should have

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.830 
Alonso tackle that probably should have
been<00:01:54.930> avoided<00:01:55.470> Alejandro<00:01:56.479> by-and-large<00:01:57.479> was

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
been avoided Alejandro by-and-large was

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
been avoided Alejandro by-and-large was
it<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.079> bad<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.500> create<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> reaction<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it that bad to create that reaction I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.820 
it that bad to create that reaction I
don't<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
don't think so

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.930 
don't think so
I<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.190> don't<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.790> you're

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
I don't I don't think that if you're

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.040 
I don't I don't think that if you're
playing<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.510> right<00:02:03.690> amount<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
playing with the right amount of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.480 
playing with the right amount of
intensity<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.920> were<00:02:04.980> playing<00:02:05.190> with<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
intensity if you were playing with the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
intensity if you were playing with the
right<00:02:05.940> amount<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.300> interest<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.080> those<00:02:07.740> sort

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
right amount of interest that those sort

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.889 
right amount of interest that those sort
of<00:02:08.070> tackles<00:02:08.460> really<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> difference<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
of tackles really make a difference to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.320 
of tackles really make a difference to
me<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.770> don't<00:02:10.950> want<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.490> don't<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
me and I don't want to I don't want to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670 
me and I don't want to I don't want to
make<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> big<00:02:12.750> deal<00:02:12.960> out<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.320> because<00:02:13.590> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
make a big deal out of this because I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
make a big deal out of this because I
think<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.100> credit<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.880> guys

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
think it's to the credit of the guys

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.610 
think it's to the credit of the guys
that<00:02:15.330> came<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> second<00:02:16.230> half<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that came out in the second half for the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.340 
that came out in the second half for the
MLS<00:02:17.040> all-stars<00:02:17.580> here's<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> Alonso<00:02:18.960> tensor

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
MLS all-stars here's the Alonso tensor

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.230 
MLS all-stars here's the Alonso tensor
and<00:02:19.650> there<00:02:19.770> was<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.160> worst<00:02:20.310> piece<00:02:20.610> late

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
and there was a the worst piece late

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.570 
and there was a the worst piece late
I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> sweeping<00:02:22.710> leg<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.040> course<00:02:23.310> gets

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
I think the sweeping leg of course gets

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.160 
I think the sweeping leg of course gets
Cecchini<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.740> me<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.130> reaction<00:02:26.930> by<00:02:27.930> Pep

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
Cecchini but to me the reaction by Pep

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.290 
Cecchini but to me the reaction by Pep
Guardiola<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.770> very<00:02:29.100> unlike<00:02:29.670> backwater<00:02:30.090> Yoda

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
Guardiola is very unlike backwater Yoda

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
Guardiola is very unlike backwater Yoda
