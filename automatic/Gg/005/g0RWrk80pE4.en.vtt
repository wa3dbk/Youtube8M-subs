past I came up with a really neat
invention<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.200> make<00:00:13.349> very<00:00:13.620> low-cost<00:00:15.379> racks

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
invention to make very low-cost racks

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.210 
invention to make very low-cost racks
and<00:00:17.430> also<00:00:17.910> using<00:00:18.630> recycled<00:00:18.960> materials<00:00:19.680> or

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
basically materials that would normally

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.310 
basically materials that would normally
just<00:00:23.130> sit<00:00:23.279> around<00:00:23.310> collect<00:00:23.820> dust<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.480> basically

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
my vids and the basic idea is basically

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240

to<00:01:10.710> make<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> low-cost<00:01:11.729> rack<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:13.250> uses

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to make a low-cost rack that uses

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.700 
to make a low-cost rack that uses
materials<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.970> already<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> hand

that<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> painted<00:01:59.759> black<00:02:00.170> okay<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.850> each<00:02:02.850> shelf

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that I painted black okay and each shelf

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.100 
that I painted black okay and each shelf
as<00:02:04.340> each<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.549> each<00:02:05.700> lid<00:02:06.390> locks<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.930> place

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
as each one each lid locks in place

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.600 
as each one each lid locks in place
using<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.680> existing<00:02:08.989> tops<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.000 

and<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> see<00:02:15.290> they<00:02:16.290> slide<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.890> out

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and if you see they slide in and out

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.360 
and if you see they slide in and out
relatively<00:02:17.700> easily<00:02:17.930> now<00:02:18.930> what<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.190> about

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
relatively easily now what I like about

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.240 
relatively easily now what I like about
it<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.180> fact<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.480> they<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.720> lock<00:02:22.250> okay

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it is the fact that they do lock okay

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.970 
it is the fact that they do lock okay
and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.390> slides<00:02:24.600> out<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.770> keep

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and then it slides out so you can keep

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.230 
and then it slides out so you can keep
snakes<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.460> here<00:02:26.610> without<00:02:26.880> worrying<00:02:27.120> about

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
snakes in here without worrying about

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.940 
snakes in here without worrying about
them<00:02:27.480> getting<00:02:27.630> out

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
them getting out

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.040 
them getting out
I've<00:02:29.460> never<00:02:29.730> had<00:02:29.940> an<00:02:30.090> animal<00:02:30.360> escape<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:30.870> any

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
I've never had an animal escape from any

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.380 
I've never had an animal escape from any
of<00:02:31.200> these<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.500> I've<00:02:31.650> made<00:02:31.890> now<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.240> by

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
of these that I've made now this is by

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.910 
of these that I've made now this is by
far<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> coolest<00:02:33.840> looking<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.440> too<00:02:34.650> because

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
far the coolest looking one too because

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
far the coolest looking one too because
I<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.070> able<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> find<00:02:35.520> black<00:02:35.790> lids<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.600> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
I was able to find black lids and I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.570 
I was able to find black lids and I
think<00:02:37.110> what<00:02:37.260> was<00:02:37.410> throwing<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.890> off<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
think what was throwing it off in the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.190 
think what was throwing it off in the
other<00:02:38.730> racks<00:02:39.090> where<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.570> fact<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.960> had<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
other racks where the fact that I had to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.490 
other racks where the fact that I had to
use<00:02:40.430> those<00:02:41.430> blue<00:02:41.850> lids<00:02:42.150> okay<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.020> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
use those blue lids okay and kind of a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
use those blue lids okay and kind of a
corny<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.240> find<00:02:45.540> some<00:02:45.840> paint

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
corny and I think I can find some paint

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.320 
corny and I think I can find some paint
that<00:02:46.710> will<00:02:46.830> adhere<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.190> plastic<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> make

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
that will adhere to plastic and I make

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.840 
that will adhere to plastic and I make
just<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.810> back<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.230> paint<00:02:49.380> them<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.730> make

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
just go back and paint them all and make

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640 
just go back and paint them all and make
them<00:02:50.970> nice<00:02:51.120> make<00:02:51.660> them<00:02:51.780> look<00:02:51.930> uniform<00:02:52.200> nice

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
them nice make them look uniform nice

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.040 
them nice make them look uniform nice
and<00:02:52.860> black<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.840> haven't<00:02:54.840> put<00:02:54.959> the

all it cost me so far where the cost of
the<00:03:17.700> tubs<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.650> four<00:03:19.650> pieces<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.070> wood<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.610> a

the tubs and four pieces of wood and a
box<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.390> screws<00:03:21.690> now<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.890> haven't<00:03:23.100> added<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
box of screws now I haven't added the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.300 
box of screws now I haven't added the
heat<00:03:23.580> tape<00:03:23.880> yet<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.230> heat<00:03:25.410> tape<00:03:25.620> isn't

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
heat tape yet but the heat tape isn't

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.860 
heat tape yet but the heat tape isn't
that<00:03:26.580> much<00:03:26.730> either<00:03:26.970> because<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.690> not

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that much either because it's really not

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.290 
that much either because it's really not
that<00:03:27.930> much<00:03:28.140> heat<00:03:28.440> tape<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.800> you're<00:03:28.920> using<00:03:29.300> I

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
that much heat tape that you're using I

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.420 
that much heat tape that you're using I
haven't<00:03:30.750> done<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.230> actual<00:03:31.380> calculation<00:03:32.220> yet

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
haven't done the actual calculation yet

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.729 
haven't done the actual calculation yet
but<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.820> usually<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.900> heat<00:03:34.140> tape<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.500> big

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
but I usually I have heat tape on big

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.820 
but I usually I have heat tape on big
rolls<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> as<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.239> guys<00:03:36.360> know<00:03:36.420> all<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.260> use<00:03:37.800> is

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
trust any other brand but when you run

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.960 
trust any other brand but when you run
your<00:03:44.280> Flex<00:03:44.550> watt

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
your Flex watt

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.979 
your Flex watt
there's<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> bunch<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.510> different<00:03:45.600> ways<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
there's a bunch of different ways you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.630 
there's a bunch of different ways you
can<00:03:46.080> do<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.800> basically<00:03:46.950> snake<00:03:47.489> it

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
can do it but I just basically snake it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.180 
can do it but I just basically snake it
through<00:03:47.670> each<00:03:47.970> level<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.980> then<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.130> course

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
through each level and then of course
