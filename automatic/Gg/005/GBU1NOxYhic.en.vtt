00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
really good for examples of negative

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.110 
really good for examples of negative
space<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:08.299> I'm<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.540> roughly<00:02:09.519> put<00:02:10.519> this<00:02:10.759> guy

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
space so I'm just roughly put this guy

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.420 
space so I'm just roughly put this guy
in<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.049> just<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.470> real<00:02:12.650> rough<00:02:12.920> sketch

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
in like this just a real rough sketch

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.760 
in like this just a real rough sketch
just<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.510> from<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.079> photo

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.840 
it's a few things I've got wrong here
the<00:02:20.990> arms<00:02:21.410> are<00:02:21.590> front<00:02:22.130> arms<00:02:22.490> are<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> wrong

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
the arms are front arms are in the wrong

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.980 
the arms are front arms are in the wrong
place<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.570> something<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.950> do<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.690> look<00:02:26.810> at

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
place and something to do is to look at

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.310 
place and something to do is to look at
it<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.320> different<00:02:27.530> way<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:27.950> instead<00:02:28.580> of

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
it in a different way so instead of

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.110 
it in a different way so instead of
looking<00:02:30.320> at<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.830> actual<00:02:31.130> object<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.730> look

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
looking at the actual object I look

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.660 
looking at the actual object I look
around<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.600> object<00:02:33.220> let<00:02:34.220> me<00:02:34.280> show<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.490> this

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
around the object let me show you this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.780 
around the object let me show you this
bit<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:35.000> footage<00:02:35.360> here<00:02:36.070> okay<00:02:37.070> now<00:02:37.370> let's<00:02:37.640> just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
bit of footage here okay now let's just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.720 
bit of footage here okay now let's just
have<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.030> look<00:02:38.150> at<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> picture<00:02:38.720> by<00:02:38.900> itself

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
have a look at the picture by itself

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.260 
have a look at the picture by itself
okay<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.780> stick<00:02:42.020> insect<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:43.270> this

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
okay this is the stick insect and this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.620 
okay this is the stick insect and this
is<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.750> space<00:02:45.050> around<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.770> stick<00:02:46.010> insect<00:02:46.630> so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
is the space around the stick insect so

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.300 
is the space around the stick insect so
back<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.870> our<00:02:48.050> drawing<00:02:48.380> here<00:02:49.390> okay<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.660> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
back to our drawing here okay this is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.280 
back to our drawing here okay this is
the<00:02:52.310> negative<00:02:52.640> space<00:02:53.060> I'm<00:02:53.600> looking<00:02:54.050> here

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
the negative space I'm looking here

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.340 
the negative space I'm looking here
between<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.040> leg<00:02:55.580> here<00:02:59.050> it's<00:03:00.050> sort<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.320> a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
between this leg here it's sort of a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.730 
between this leg here it's sort of a
triangle<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:01.190> here<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:01.850> can<00:03:02.000> see<00:03:02.300> another<00:03:02.740> sort

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
triangle and here I can see another sort

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.490 
triangle and here I can see another sort
of<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.890> triangle<00:03:04.430> almost<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.510> triangle<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.350> I

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
of a triangle almost a triangle and I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.290 
of a triangle almost a triangle and I
sort<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.800> draw<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.970> those<00:03:08.180> shapes<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.080> those

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
sort of draw in those shapes and those

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.420 
sort of draw in those shapes and those
shapes<00:03:11.300> they're<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:12.560> here's<00:03:12.800> another<00:03:13.040> shape

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
shapes they're like here's another shape

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.500 
shapes they're like here's another shape
here<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:14.150> trapezius<00:03:14.900> sort<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.830> shape

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
here I have trapezius sort of a shape

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.200 
here I have trapezius sort of a shape
this<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.320> help<00:03:18.680> me<00:03:18.920> get<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.850> much<00:03:20.180> more

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
this is going to help me get a much more

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.930 
this is going to help me get a much more
accurate<00:03:20.630> drawing<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.550> can<00:03:22.700> do<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
accurate drawing so I can do the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.470 
accurate drawing so I can do the
corrections<00:03:23.570> by<00:03:24.050> basically<00:03:25.040> lining<00:03:25.820> out<00:03:26.030> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
corrections by basically lining out the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.700 
corrections by basically lining out the
space<00:03:26.750> between<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.980> legs<00:03:29.320> it's<00:03:30.320> just<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
space between the legs it's just a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.780 
space between the legs it's just a
different<00:03:31.160> way<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> looking<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.390> seeing<00:03:32.690> and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
different way of looking and seeing and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.130 
different way of looking and seeing and
if<00:03:34.790> you've<00:03:35.060> been<00:03:35.210> drawing<00:03:35.420> for<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.690> while<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
if you've been drawing for a while you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.930 
if you've been drawing for a while you
know<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.500> will<00:03:36.710> really<00:03:37.040> help<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.670> even

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
know this will really help you and even

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.790 
know this will really help you and even
just<00:03:38.950> half<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.580> know<00:03:40.670> there's<00:03:41.680> like<00:03:42.680> an

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
just half of it you know there's like an

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.760 
just half of it you know there's like an
upside<00:03:43.130> down<00:03:43.400> V<00:03:43.700> shape<00:03:43.730> here<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.410> that's<00:03:45.560> just

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
upside down V shape here and that's just

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.180 
upside down V shape here and that's just
part<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.850> negative<00:03:47.180> shape<00:03:50.980> once<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.100> get

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
part of a negative shape once you get

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.860 
part of a negative shape once you get
used<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.460> looking<00:03:52.580> at<00:03:52.820> negative<00:03:53.210> spaces<00:03:53.690> it

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
used to looking at negative spaces it

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.960 
used to looking at negative spaces it
will<00:03:53.900> improve<00:03:54.410> your<00:03:54.620> art<00:03:54.830> or<00:03:55.190> certainly

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
will improve your art or certainly

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.380 
will improve your art or certainly
improve<00:03:56.870> or<00:03:57.290> help<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.430> correct<00:03:58.970> your

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
improve or help you correct your

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.250 
improve or help you correct your
mistakes<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:05.180> now<00:04:05.390> I've<00:04:05.510> progressed<00:04:05.990> a<00:04:06.110> little

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
mistakes so now I've progressed a little

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.310 
mistakes so now I've progressed a little
bit<00:04:06.470> further<00:04:06.860> with<00:04:07.160> this<00:04:07.340> drawing<00:04:08.170> shading<00:04:09.170> it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
bit further with this drawing shading it

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.870 
bit further with this drawing shading it
in<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> bit<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.980> pit<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.400> be<00:04:13.520> honest

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
in a bit and the pit to be honest

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.510 
in a bit and the pit to be honest
actually<00:04:14.090> like<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.690> sketches<00:04:15.350> I<00:04:15.470> did<00:04:15.520> the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
actually like the sketches I did the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.160 
actually like the sketches I did the
other<00:04:16.730> day<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> little<00:04:17.299> bit<00:04:17.420> better<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.810> bit

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
other day a little bit better a bit

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.280 
other day a little bit better a bit
quicker<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:19.070> rough<00:04:19.340> own<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.910> bit<00:04:20.810> more<00:04:20.989> freedom

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
quicker and rough own a bit more freedom

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.210 
quicker and rough own a bit more freedom
to<00:04:21.440> learn<00:04:22.840> I've<00:04:23.840> gone<00:04:24.110> back<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.800> sketch

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
to learn I've gone back to the sketch

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.700 
to learn I've gone back to the sketch
pad<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:26.030> have<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.180> look<00:04:26.420> into<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.020> wine

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
pad just to have a look into the wine

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.800 
pad just to have a look into the wine
our<00:04:27.860> sketching<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.520> other<00:04:28.640> day<00:04:28.850> has

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
our sketching the other day has

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.720 
our sketching the other day has
almost<00:04:30.260> like<00:04:30.530> little<00:04:30.800> leafy<00:04:31.190> bits<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.580> its

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
almost like little leafy bits on its

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.520 
almost like little leafy bits on its
legs<00:04:32.000> which<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.810> noticed<00:04:33.170> when<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.440> was

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
legs which I noticed when I was

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.410 
legs which I noticed when I was
sketching<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:34.190> I'm<00:04:34.250> gonna<00:04:34.490> add<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.060> bit<00:04:35.360> of

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
sketching it so I'm gonna add a bit of

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.220 
sketching it so I'm gonna add a bit of
that<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:36.050> my<00:04:36.230> stick<00:04:36.530> insect<00:04:36.980> here<00:04:38.230> it's

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
that to my stick insect here it's

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.350 
that to my stick insect here it's
possibly<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.890> different<00:04:40.070> species<00:04:40.610> although

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
possibly a different species although

might do is put a watercolor wash over
it<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.770> see<00:04:48.950> if<00:04:49.010> that's<00:04:49.220> going<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.550> lift<00:04:49.850> it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
it to see if that's going to lift it
