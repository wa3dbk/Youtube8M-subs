 ml of fresh milk may cause the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 normal, it may be the same thing to see and we will 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.250
 add our parmesan about two 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 spoons of parmesan for this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.240

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.970
 cream game 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 let's move gently let the good 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 fire slowly and stirring gently to 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.210
 that he delivered on all walls of the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.820

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.869
 now the most important moment of our 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.509
 salt recipe that is the shrimp 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.690
 We'll put a little oil on it. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690
 of sunflower 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 We tried the club to get the whole frying pan 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.670
 and let's put a little garlic 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.240
 again very little in and the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 our prawns 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:47.370
 look what a wonderful little noise the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:51.239
 shrimp does not pass that much it kicks 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.290

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.930

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.230
 gives a peek come we 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.330
 add the purple onion a 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.870
 spoonful remembering that our 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
 preparation is quantity for one person 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.390
 in individual 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 here we have eight shrimp prawns 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:32.660
 gray in which we put the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:38.640
 to do what we call 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.579

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.100
 adjust our salt 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.450
 we are a little bit like I know 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.060

 let's go and treat 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.320
 I chose a deep dish because I think 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.160
 It will be more comfortable to eat. 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.160
