00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.790
 Imagine you have nothing of particular value in house and yet not from now on 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.629
 broke in twice but three times without getting anything 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.779
 taken along 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.779
 seen a nightmare 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.279
 in Zwolle North in the Alan Bond district to the dead end buses that run it 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.589
 family where we broke in no less than three times in five months 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.149
 all three times the ladies come over a two-meter-high fence to the back garden 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:31.590
 within 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.780
 the first time is thursday evening a November around 8 am the burglars 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.910
 Know that the surveillance cameras hang this man had that in mind and sharp 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.520
 as he walks past his face off, but his henchman forgets that and it is 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.040
 to see life in his face 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.370
 the man a ladder a ladder from the barn and we also see the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 first burglar in his face 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.380
 through the flat roof tried to force a window and also the camera to get ready 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.290
 to make 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.670
 in other words, the past of a camera such as the burglary itself fails 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.950
 probably because they were disturbed 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.640
 just before they break the burglary and climbs the second man hits left along the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 camera and we see that he is wearing an adidas brand book 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.829
 the second burglary is on Sunday, December 23, just before Christmas 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.319
 the burglars now think they can avoid the cameras by removing lights 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.340
 to turn 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.700
 but the camera also films smoothly in the dark for one of the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.050
 Burglars that are clearly too dark are bonuses that we are also in 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.300
 face 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.200
 they finally managed to enter the house, they are also used up 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 look for money but the voter does not leave without loot they leave again 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.560
 and so it does not stop on Sunday, March 24 for a third time 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.350
 broken in again by two men who want to outsmart the camera 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.230
 this time the surveillance camera is taped 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.400
 but inside the filming continues, the men ran inside after them 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.780
 having forced a window with the weather, nothing of the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.290
 found that the perpetrators through the hall and the bedroom window again outside 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.650
 flee 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.600
 English is the entire neighborhood working on it but really safe for the family says 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.519
 if that doesn't help finding these burglars 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.439
 The director said the two look at you but the Netherlands hour an attack 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.480
 finds it is not immediately clear whether it is always the same perpetrators here 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.090
 we see all three boys in succession 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.140
 people all seem to be slightly tinted men north african they don't seem 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.470
 immediately they themselves the man probably different from the same offender group 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.029
 that operates in varying composition 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:35.139
 have you already known call and stop seeing this misery of a swollen
