00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 at and welcome to powertech 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.250
 I have just got a new message 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.900
 get my facebook fanpage and me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 think that this is a problem that that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.480
 mediterranean there has written the name 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.330
 Of course, I do not want to call that 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 those remain anonymous but I think so 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.189
 is a problem that affects many 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.769
 and that's why I like it here 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 answer publicly in a video 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.800
 and this girl has me 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.990
 written 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 Dear Carla I feel very weak 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.769
 often have vertigo and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.910
 weak spells and more recently one too 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.770
 low blood pressure 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 i do a lot of endurance and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 strength training and feel anyway 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.790
 all the time weak and helpless like that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 as if I'm sick of the problem 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 I recognized of course and have mine 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 dog calorie demand calculated what am 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.879
 day after my bill about 2,000 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 Calories are when I'm at lunch and 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 in the evening but no carbs eat 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.160
 and I do not eat in between 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.719
 because I'm scared that's me 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 hips suggests I reach 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.359
 maybe at most 1500 calories per day 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.160
 Day 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.110
 and there is so much sport doing and me 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 never really enough to eat is that probably the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.119
 reason that it is getting worse and worse 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.909
 going 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.070
 But I 'm really scared when I am 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 eat normally again at noon 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 and healthy carbohydrates in the evening 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.220
 I also always eat enough in between 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 that I increase again and me 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 my and my body again 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.759
 that is, I am getting fatter again 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 will 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.030
 Besides, she still writes when I do 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.920
 eat normally again and paint 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.479
 continue my sport I do have 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 just scared that I mean 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.479
 metabolism broke and for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.159
 always destroyed 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.010
 and I can never eat normally again 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.600
 without taking 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.920
 the problem with the thing is that has 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.490
 the girl already recognized correctly 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.620
 if you are less calorie than you 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.860
 you will of course take off first 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.110
 you need and reduce body fat one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.790
 calorie deficit that's one side 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.410
 the equation the other side of the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.150
 Of course, equation is definite 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.010
 depending on what you eat because there is 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.600
 Simply the food 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.570
 metabolism gives us more stimulation 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.250
 foods that metabolize yes 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.990
 just pretty lame the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.820
 raise blood sugar levels and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.820
 promote fat storage 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.280
 Basically it is so this 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.570
 reader has really recognized that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.340
 the problem is that she is 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.020
 permanently too little and if you do that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.090
 you feel that you are always hungry 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.800
 that you can you never eat enough of that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.450
 she does not grow anything in between because of you 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.209
 it could be on the back again 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.670
 hips land even though you are right 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 Active and endurance and weight training 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.489
 I had to really take care of that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.470
 you do not think I'm always there he is 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.790
 just quite a bit too easy after 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.500
 disturbance so not necessarily bulimia 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.150
 or anorexia that's natural 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380
 extreme shape but you can already 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.850
 have an eating disorder if you have the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.769
 All day thinking about nothing else than 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.840
 how much calories it has now 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.390
 what you are right now and that you do not 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.030
 About certain calorie requirements 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.070
 calories sum out quite whole 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
 is important and not only for 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.630
 the girl really but the money for 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.850
 Everyone who knows this problem you have to 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.160
 Look that you are sufficient if you 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.470
 permanently is not enough if 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.540
 permanent and big calorie deficit 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.190
 then you will lose weight at the beginning 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.630
 but you will have a metabolism against 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.610
 drive the wall and when he is in the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.630
 Keller is because he is relatively heavy there 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.640
 rauszuholen again 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.670
 that is, the sooner you have this problem 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.310
 realize the better and you have to immediately 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.890
 start countering that means too 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.810
 Strange that sounds please is more 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.600
 if you are hungry and definitely too 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.459
 little is more and pay attention to it 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.130
 to eat real things that is 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.890
 vegetables good if you if you do not 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.520
 vegetarian until then fish and meat on 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.530
 best course from organic farming 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.260
 also eggs from organic attitude if you 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.120
 vegetarian until then you have more on 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.500
 vegetables may also access 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.450
 rock fruit or if it does not 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.670
 the same goes for tofu personally 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.280
 no big fan of tobin of 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.180
 soy products in general but on everyone 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.140
 if possible, play natural games 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.510
 unprocessed food as 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.000
 Of course no one if possible 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.650
 no bread and noodles and so on and so on 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.150
 Of course no fast food but 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.060
 as natural as possible unprocessed 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.620
 food and eat as much of it 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.459
 a natural healthy 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.690
 saturation and not 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 to endure hunger just out of fear 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.070
 that you are too many calories if you 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.600
 you are active when you train when you are there 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.190
 a bit of his training 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.840
 borders is not just a walk 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.180
 goes but also give a bit of gas 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.290
 then it is all right and you 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.420
 have to eat 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.100
 because as the girl says you feel 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.720
 you then sick and tired that is too 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.000
 no wonder because you want to be 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.040
 Body really much off you give him but 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.420
 no energy back and that can 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.950
 just do not work you can 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.200
 do not expect from the car 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.450
 That's hundreds of miles 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.920
 drives without gasoline to protect and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.020
 the right gasoline if the wrong one 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.270
 gasoline is pure step then s car goes 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.520
 also broken so very important to look out for 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.720
 Your diet will take care of what you eat 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.590
 and I is full when you your 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.510
 metabolism breaks down if you too 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.100
 Low calorie is then turn it on 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.540
 I have certain hormones 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.400
 my whole series made 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.440
 which cause the metabolism 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.230
 really down that drives 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.270
 Feeling of hunger changes and that you 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.060
 that much faster fat stores that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.870
 is the only way out of this is 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.210
 decent tournaments regularly 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.300
 It's best to work out five to six times 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.660
 the week shorter and more intense and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.830
 most importantly the most important 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.410
 adequate the right foods 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.030
 Eat and that's the tip I get 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.669
 Of course I gave her too 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.040
 quad answers out of this 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.870
 I can not eat higher 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.700
 to think about how much 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.590
 calories has everything but 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.240
 Pay attention to what you eat 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.370
 that it is of course processed 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.920
 I'm full and trained and then need 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.550
 you no 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.760
 it's that you take it from you thick 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.740
 I am and I swam I hope this 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.060
 I liked that video I hope that 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.000
 you this tip if you the same 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.800
 problem hast helps one again 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.900
 normal healthy track to come and 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.550
 Do not think about eating only in calories 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.730
 I think that is very important for me too 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.260
 the quality of life because that you 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.780
 sufficiently trained and correct 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.400
 train especially as and really 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.450
 intensive tournaments should be nothing 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.460
 be new for you 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.170
