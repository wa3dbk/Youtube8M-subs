and last outing I had my gold
prospecting<00:00:26.400> Club<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.849> were<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
prospecting Club we were using it to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.080 
prospecting Club we were using it to
clean<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.990> crevices<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.800> worked<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.000> well

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
clean out crevices so worked very well

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
clean out crevices so worked very well
put<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.800> strong<00:00:31.800> jet<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> water<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.579> was

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
put out a strong jet of water and was

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.770 
put out a strong jet of water and was
able<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> clean<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.800> some<00:00:34.800> crevices<00:00:35.780> between

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
able to clean out some crevices between

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.190 
able to clean out some crevices between
rocks<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.300> me<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> thinking<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
rocks and and it got me to thinking that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250 
rocks and and it got me to thinking that
I<00:00:40.440> wonder<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.850> person<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
I wonder if a person could use one of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.630 
I wonder if a person could use one of
these<00:00:43.500> pumps<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:47.719> create<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> venturi<00:00:49.640> suction

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
these pumps to create a venturi suction

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
these pumps to create a venturi suction
nozzle<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> dredge<00:00:51.840> user<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> came<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
nozzle like a dredge user so I came up

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.310 
nozzle like a dredge user so I came up
with<00:00:56.180> came<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.600> gizmo<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.210> I

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
with came up with this gizmo and I

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
with came up with this gizmo and I
hooked<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.739> my<00:01:01.920> thousand<00:01:02.699> gallon<00:01:02.969> per

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hooked that up to my thousand gallon per

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.289 
hooked that up to my thousand gallon per
hour<00:01:03.239> pump<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:05.240> it<00:01:06.240> works<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> champ<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
hour pump and it works like a champ is

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.760 
hour pump and it works like a champ is
puts<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.689> strong<00:01:09.990> stream<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> water

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
puts out a really strong stream of water

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
puts out a really strong stream of water
generates<00:01:11.670> quite<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.270> suction<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
generates quite a lot of suction at the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.850 
generates quite a lot of suction at the
tip<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.630> sucks<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.720> material<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.650> well

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
tip and sucks up material pretty well

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
tip and sucks up material pretty well
I'll<00:01:17.700> show<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:19.310> okay<00:01:20.310> here's<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> setup<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I'll show you okay here's the setup I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.969 
I'll show you okay here's the setup I
got<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> bucket<00:01:22.020> full<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.729> sand<00:01:24.619> I've<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.830> my

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
got a bucket full of sand I've got my

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.539 
got a bucket full of sand I've got my
bucket<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.640> nozzle<00:01:30.530> outputs<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
bucket to that the nozzle outputs to and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
bucket to that the nozzle outputs to and
I've<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> bucket<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> water<00:01:33.479> representing

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I've got a bucket of water representing

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
I've got a bucket of water representing
the<00:01:34.710> river<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:37.259> battery<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.460> pump<00:01:38.939> has

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the river and the battery the pump has

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
the river and the battery the pump has
dropped<00:01:39.329> into<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.079> river<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> nozzle<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.920> in

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
dropped into the river the nozzle is in

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.389 
dropped into the river the nozzle is in
the<00:01:44.250> pocket<00:01:44.970> where<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> sandy<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.649> hook

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the pocket where the sandy is and hook

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.870 
the pocket where the sandy is and hook
up<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.610> battery

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.260 

and<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.000> starts<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:58.350> sucks

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and it starts as you can see it sucks

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:27.430 
and it starts as you can see it sucks
very<00:02:00.900> well

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:58.540 

it's<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> mini<00:02:29.010> dredge<00:02:29.340> sorta

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.240 

there<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.530> pretty<00:03:01.530> interesting<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
there you have it pretty interesting I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.510 
there you have it pretty interesting I
don't<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:02.970> how<00:03:03.120> useful<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.750> would<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.020> but

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
don't know how useful it would be but

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.370 
don't know how useful it would be but
would<00:03:05.520> make<00:03:06.230> it's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.760> concept<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.480> 12-volt

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
would make it's a concept for a 12-volt

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.800 
would make it's a concept for a 12-volt
sniping<00:03:11.280> pump<00:03:11.989> instead<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.200> hand<00:03:13.500> pumped

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
sniping pump instead of a hand pumped

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
sniping pump instead of a hand pumped
gold<00:03:15.810> tube<00:03:16.310> one<00:03:17.310> driven<00:03:17.550> by<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.819> little<00:03:18.060> 12<00:03:18.270> volt
