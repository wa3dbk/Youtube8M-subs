this<00:01:20.000> device<00:01:20.420> actually<00:01:21.080> rotates<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.770> lot<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.100> us

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
this device actually rotates a lot of us

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.290 
this device actually rotates a lot of us
have<00:01:22.370> trouble<00:01:22.550> when<00:01:22.760> you're<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.120> mouth

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and saying you've got to flip over now

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.140 
and saying you've got to flip over now
you've<00:01:24.860> got<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.100> find<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> button<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.880> fight

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
you've got to find the button you fight

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.120 
you've got to find the button you fight
it<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.360> little<00:01:26.540> bit<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.470> device<00:01:27.830> actually

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it a little bit this device actually

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.000 
it a little bit this device actually
rotates<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> LED<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.650> camera

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
rotates so that the LED and the camera

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.120 
rotates so that the LED and the camera
portion<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> will<00:01:31.790> rotate<00:01:32.030> around<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
portion of it will rotate around and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.950 
portion of it will rotate around and
allow<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.490> get<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.730> upper<00:01:35.060> arch<00:01:35.330> or<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
allow you to get the upper arch or the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.780 
allow you to get the upper arch or the
lower<00:01:36.170> arch<00:01:36.530> while<00:01:37.160> maintaining<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.760> same

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
lower arch while maintaining the same

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.310 
lower arch while maintaining the same
orientation<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.780> your<00:01:38.840> wrist<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
orientation of your wrist in the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.070 
orientation of your wrist in the
patient's<00:01:39.770> mouth<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.250> because<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.300> this<00:01:41.450> they

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
patient's mouth and because of this they

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.480 
patient's mouth and because of this they
do<00:01:42.140> have<00:01:42.440> barriers<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:43.220> an<00:01:43.280> interesting

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
do have barriers and it's an interesting

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.830 
do have barriers and it's an interesting
thing<00:01:43.670> they've<00:01:44.000> actually<00:01:44.330> devised<00:01:44.660> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
thing they've actually devised the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.900 
thing they've actually devised the
