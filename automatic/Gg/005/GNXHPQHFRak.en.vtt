 more time to the channel today I want 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 talk to you about a topic because 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.679
 in all the videos of the software since 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.060
 I have seen messages and comments 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.189
 referring to this topic that we are going to talk about 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.069
 in today's messages that the truth 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.289
 is that I do not know I'd like to speak it in 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:30.109
 this video I get comments saying 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.449
 fame and the software you already know is a 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.399
 trash epic games just wants money 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.359
 This game just did to get 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.920
 money to see let's see to start 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.960
 I'm going to defend you already know and I'm not going to 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.760
 defend any game all games 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.429
 because we are going to talk about reality 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.260
 let's talk about how things are 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.870
 because many people who see me 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 I'm sure they have around 9 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.879
 12 13 15 years 14 do not know more or less 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.100
 how the industry of the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.019
 videogames and good the industry the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.879
 videogames is handled by money like this 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.980
 how it moves almost all the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.200
 aspects of our life that move 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.079
 for the money unfortunately the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.899
 video games like epic studios like epic 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.810
 games as studios know that if 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.820
 treyarch infinity ward the ace posted 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.850
 the developers activision and so on 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.119
 moves for the money or that we suppose 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.610
 you and you create a game develops is a 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.110
 game is not a cool new game that does not 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.390
 the game has been very good 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.729
 then you develop it with your 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
 friends for fun so that the face 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.539
 that people do not then imagine 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.119
 that you want to launch this game for 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.099
 that people play it ok you go with 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.349
 some developer suppose you go 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.939
 with activision and tell them you know that 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.920
 look at him I have this game and I want it 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.079
 throw and they will tell you look you know 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 your game is super cool we'll 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.049
 to give so many millions of dollars and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.020
 we are going to be the owners of the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.640
 franchise the franchise is going to call 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.200
 pepito the hunting wolves not so called 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 pepito the wolf hunt not like that is called the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.720
 franchise then they give you your lanita no 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.539
 and activision and you know this one from your 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.909
 game was a success sold so much and I want 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.850
 two more games you are going to sign a contract 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.470
 for two more games and you say ok 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.980
 perfect I will make the games but 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.440
 assets 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.080
 is going to tell you look you know that the second 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.720
 I want you to play the game and I want 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.010
 that you do four of that is more than not 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.290
 they're going to come in the game but they 're going 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.849
 to sell separately as extra content and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.080
 there starts all of these three 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.879
 gentlemen there the whole disaster starts 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.340
 when they begin to develop 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.950
 put your hand in the game when they start 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.019
 do it and you can not go look you know that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.090
 I will not do what I want because 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.950
 there you are no longer the boss because pepito 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.910
 the house or you no longer belongs to you 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.700
 okay 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.849
 pepito the casalobos now belongs to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.890
 activision or belongs to microsoft or 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.690
 belongs to that, that's how they move 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 the videogames gentlemen this is how it 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.760
 move all the dlc is all that you 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.200
 You see that sometimes you say is that only 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.150
 they want to take out money is that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.090
 unfortunately this is the industry of 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.150
 the video games hello 1 hello 2 and halo 3 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.200
 they were the best kilos already from there the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.390
 odst and the ritz were already games that 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.829
 they took out only by contract or that because 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.629
 in the contract he said they had to 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.190
 make five games and then he was going to 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.599
 finish the time and they had not done the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.130
 games I hate this was a game 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.290
 It was very fast 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.270
 campaign done and the shooting mode the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 shooting mode was new but the truth is 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.460
 that did not have the time that halo had 3 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.560
 that the two that one then many 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.840
 Sometimes the same thing happens with this with the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.550
 jackson software 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.500
 I can bet you that it will not be the 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.260
 last want you although they announced cribier 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.020
 software 3 was the end of the saga the end 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.030
 of the saga of marcus and his friends go 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.710
 to come more than the software ok 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.690
 are going to come rather software are going to 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.720
 keep coming out more call of duty for yourself 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.750
 I bet you're going to be 83 years old and your 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.770
 grandchildren are going to play call of duty modern 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.960
 warfare 57 the chabelo squadron ok 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.700
 then this is how it turns 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.710
 video game industry or and he 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.280
 and the chabelo squad is macabre 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.320
 ok of chabelo going to go here does not kill me 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.720
 all this is the bato ends with the 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.160
 War is not so as it moves the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.040
 video games industry you can not 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.500
 say that jackman is just want 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.600
 money when in fact it is that all 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.850
 the games are equal call of duty only 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.190
 they are interested in the activision money I 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.870
 I'm sure treyarch 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.150
 They do not like people talking bad about 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.970
 their game I and I am sure that they 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.070
 they want to make a very good game but 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.780
 activision or permits them that 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.930
 activision tells them you know you have a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.050
 year nothing else to make a game or 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.690
 One year you know one year I am sure 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.060
 that traders would like to create a game 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.030
 that revolutionizes the industry a game 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.700
 that it takes up to 34 years for it to be a 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650
 game that you say do not invent call of duty 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.300
 whites 2 the net I respect one of the 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 best games that I played all my life 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.100
 without the action but I'm sure 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.590
 that are not they is the companies the 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.050
 developers they are the ones 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.310
 they ruin the industry and they either 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.380
 they are at fault 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.960
 ok because this is a business for them 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.910
 they do not think they play video games 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.760
 they are more accountants are 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.480
 bankers are investors are 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.890
 investors are people who 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.600
 they want to make money and they invest in 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.120
 industries invest in companies 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.100
 then, after all, we can not 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.870
 live a life complaining that a 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.880
 game is only made for money or 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.750
 because that's how the industry of the 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.220
 video game 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.010
 If you want to make a game, you have to 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.990
 create your own study and what goes and what and 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.580
 what are you going to pay for your study with what 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.920
 they will eat with what they will keep their 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.790
 families because a game takes time 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.590
 so 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.080
 that's where they start moving the 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.600
 money and everything moves for money by 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.880
 that is, I have respect for a 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.530
 study called riot games that are the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.000
 creators of the code of the eye no no no 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.640
 I did not come to Spain league of 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.880
 legends you look for riot games is a 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.010
 studio that created the most played game in the 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.419
 world is currently the most common game 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.510
 and they know why it's the most played game 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.850
 of the world because it is totally free 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.040
 game has been going for almost 4 years now and 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.490
 it's completely free, new ones come out 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.380
 champions there are no new servers of 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.030
 everything and free or that I do not come to 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.680
 Spain league of legends if they do not want 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.450
 play then give him not play it I 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.300
 I'm also talking about the study of 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.310
 study of raid game ok that's something very 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.260
 risky and it's something new that changed the 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.930
 industry or that is something that made you tremble 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.450
 to pc games then that's what 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.600
 it takes me I think for xbox to take out 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.630
 in a free game for xbox but that 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.210
 be a good game 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.190
 so I think that is not worth it 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.350
 that people say that gears of war already 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.910
 you know it's only made for money when 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.970
 is that the call of duty are the same 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.860
 when other games are the same 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.910
 or worse, even the hello franchise 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.480
 hello 4 was good is good is a great game 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:03.780
 but he lacked things he lacked things 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.900
 then you know that is my point 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.520
 view gentlemen if you have a point of 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.140
