00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
put that into the root of flash 360 and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.790 
put that into the root of flash 360 and
so<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.360> did<00:04:22.570> use<00:04:22.750> USB<00:04:23.200> for<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.590> tutorial

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
so I did use USB for this tutorial

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.130 
so I did use USB for this tutorial
usually<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> use<00:04:24.490> FTP<00:04:25.240> but<00:04:25.510> i<00:04:25.540> actually

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
usually I use FTP but i actually

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.280 
usually I use FTP but i actually
purchased<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.650> new<00:04:26.800> USB<00:04:27.220> flash<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.820> 64<00:04:28.450> gigs<00:04:28.750> so

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
purchased a new USB flash of 64 gigs so

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.990 
purchased a new USB flash of 64 gigs so
I<00:04:29.320> figured<00:04:29.650> I'd<00:04:29.740> put<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.190> good<00:04:30.220> use<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.820> not

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
I figured I'd put it to good use and not

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.460 
I figured I'd put it to good use and not
just<00:04:31.210> letting<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.570> let<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.840> sit<00:04:32.020> over<00:04:32.260> on<00:04:32.380> my

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
just letting it let it sit over on my

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.770 
just letting it let it sit over on my
