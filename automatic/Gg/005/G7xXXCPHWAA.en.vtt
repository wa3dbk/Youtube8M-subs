00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello I'm graben de cn and in this video os 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.470
 I'm going to teach a plugin called whitman 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.869
 for playstation3 that allows us to load 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.040
 backups of games directly from the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.020
 xml 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.110
 no need to use any backup 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.110
 manager 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.650
 to load our blogging 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.670
 we will need an application that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.490
 call prx loader 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.410
 we execute it 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.420
 this takes about 7 seconds 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.420
 approximately and will return that moves 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.020
 well we are again xm here you can see 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.040
 that I have games votes equalize tension 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 loaded 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.980
 and just above it appears my game that is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.720
 where will we have the games this option 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 would be to dismantle the games that 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.390
 we have loaded here is where we have 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.950
 the hard drive games and here the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950
 settings of this plugin 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.960
 well in the adjustments we have for 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:21.689
 deactivate where we want in what discs 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 we want you to download games 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.030
 if we want to enable writing in 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.820
 flash 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 and disable the settings and times of 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.640
 wait to scan in usb 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.420
 we also have access to a 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.420
 file manager 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.579
 and finally another alternative access to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.600
 the games that you also have to say that 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.579
 you can have access through ip with 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.320
 other devices whether it's a smartphone 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.200
 a computer or a tablet 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.390
 and also has an ftp running on 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.670
 second plane to which we will have access 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.930
 during all the processes that we do 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.930
 either play or whatever 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.210
 well now finally let's make a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.100
 test to load a game 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.100
 in this case the alice madness returns 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.430
 we do not load 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.150
 we go back and where before installing 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 the vote save session now we will see that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 will appear legal send return 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.110
 now finally we load it so that 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.110
 see that it works correctly 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.310
 now 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.260
 and well, this is a greeting 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.260
 we see in dax orders point or heretic
