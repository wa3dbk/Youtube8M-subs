 that many of us in life do not 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.239

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.170

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.539

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.539
 saluted 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.000
 how many of you do not have a father 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.950
 because you do all this I'm amazing 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.390
 what happens when you ask for something 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.689
 true is that all this happened to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.100
 Denis I only do my part, what happens 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.470
 my two kidneys stopped working 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.840
 a few years ago I went from being in the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.390
 prison to work on the project that has 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.560
 past sanz that has been of the girl 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.170
 optimist that I knew 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.820
 murdered my husband in your neighborhood in 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 as I saw a man who matched 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.230
 the description of the weak killer and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.159
 wearing a red hood is called 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.469
 anthony jones 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.689
 that's life, I guess it's a 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.539
 dead end I have gone through things 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.740
 similar and it's not a dead end 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.039
 if it takes you to a place where 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 you needed to go is fine your body has 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.659
 rejected dialysis no matter what happens 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 take care of those children
