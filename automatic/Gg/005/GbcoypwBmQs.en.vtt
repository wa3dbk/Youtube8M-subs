00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
to rewire itself it's called

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.960 
to rewire itself it's called
neuroplasticity<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.310> how<00:03:44.430> we<00:03:44.489> learn<00:03:44.730> new

your brain can rewire itself at any
point<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.120> time<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:10.400> let's<00:04:11.400> talk<00:04:11.579> about<00:04:11.730> how

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
point in time so let's talk about how

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.449 
point in time so let's talk about how
you<00:04:11.970> might<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.480> first<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.769> even<00:04:14.190> if

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
you might do that first of all even if

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.990 
you might do that first of all even if
you're<00:04:14.579> an<00:04:14.670> electronic<00:04:15.239> musician<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:16.769> have<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you're an electronic musician you have a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.690 
you're an electronic musician you have a
massive<00:04:18.630> massive<00:04:19.079> motivation<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.250> take<00:04:20.400> up<00:04:20.579> an

massive massive motivation to take up an
acoustic<00:04:21.090> instrument<00:04:21.180> because<00:04:22.019> an<00:04:22.140> acoustic

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
acoustic instrument because an acoustic

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.850 
acoustic instrument because an acoustic
instrument<00:04:22.680> piano<00:04:23.580> guitar<00:04:24.300> saxophone<00:04:24.930> or

instrument piano guitar saxophone or
even<00:04:26.070> singing<00:04:26.310> requires<00:04:27.270> that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
even singing requires that

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.470 
even singing requires that
the<00:04:28.250> left<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.700> right-hand<00:04:28.910> sides<00:04:29.300> of

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
the left and the right-hand sides of

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.960 
the left and the right-hand sides of
your<00:04:29.600> brain<00:04:29.780> communicate<00:04:30.680> better<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.760> piece

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
your brain communicate better the piece

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.640 
your brain communicate better the piece
of<00:04:32.120> your<00:04:32.270> brain<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:32.510> connects<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.230> left<00:04:33.380> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
of your brain that connects the left and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.070 
of your brain that connects the left and
the<00:04:33.710> right-hand<00:04:33.890> sides<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:35.210> jump<00:04:35.660> called

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
the right-hand sides is this jump called

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.100 
the right-hand sides is this jump called
the<00:04:36.530> corpus<00:04:36.890> callosum<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:38.720> has<00:04:38.900> been

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the corpus callosum and it has been

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.130 
the corpus callosum and it has been
scientifically<00:04:39.680> proven<00:04:40.250> in<00:04:40.600> musicians<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:42.110> be

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
scientifically proven in musicians to be

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140 
scientifically proven in musicians to be
much<00:04:42.410> larger<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.890> more<00:04:43.280> developed<00:04:43.730> because

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
much larger and more developed because

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.820 
much larger and more developed because
it<00:04:44.330> requires<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:45.020> communication<00:04:45.680> between

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
it requires that communication between

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.220 
it requires that communication between
the<00:04:46.100> two<00:04:46.220> sides<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.360> how<00:04:47.540> can<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.900> go<00:04:48.050> about

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
the two sides so how can you go about

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.930 
the two sides so how can you go about
increasing<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.920> to<00:04:49.160> help<00:04:49.310> your<00:04:49.580> left<00:04:49.790> in

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
increasing that to help your left in

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.760 
increasing that to help your left in
your<00:04:50.030> right<00:04:50.180> brain<00:04:50.420> to<00:04:50.690> communicate<00:04:51.380> better

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
your right brain to communicate better

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.010 
your right brain to communicate better
well<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:53.060> simpler<00:04:53.450> than<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.600> might<00:04:53.690> think

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
well it's simpler than you might think

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.160 
well it's simpler than you might think
it's<00:04:54.770> practice<00:04:55.660> neuroplasticity<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
it's practice neuroplasticity and the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.300 
it's practice neuroplasticity and the
way<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.440> your<00:04:57.530> brain<00:04:57.680> rewires<00:04:58.190> itself

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
way that your brain rewires itself

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.730 
way that your brain rewires itself
requires<00:04:59.030> constant<00:04:59.690> stimulus<00:05:00.110> over<00:05:00.500> time

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
requires constant stimulus over time

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.770 
requires constant stimulus over time
that's<00:05:01.070> why<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.310> takes<00:05:01.640> they<00:05:01.880> say<00:05:02.030> 30<00:05:02.330> days<00:05:02.540> or

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
that's why it takes they say 30 days or

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.050 
that's why it takes they say 30 days or
so<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:02.990> build<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.560> new<00:05:03.680> habit<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.460> consistency

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
so to build a new habit that consistency

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.490 
so to build a new habit that consistency
over<00:05:05.210> time<00:05:05.510> helps<00:05:06.380> your<00:05:06.500> brain<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.040> rewire<00:05:07.190> so

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
over time helps your brain to rewire so

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.350 
over time helps your brain to rewire so
the<00:05:09.500> studies<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.220> past<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:11.060> showed

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
the studies in the past that showed

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.620 
the studies in the past that showed
musicians<00:05:12.260> having<00:05:12.920> a<00:05:13.100> larger<00:05:13.550> larger<00:05:14.000> corpus

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
musicians having a larger larger corpus

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.860 
musicians having a larger larger corpus
callosum<00:05:15.170> than<00:05:15.650> known<00:05:15.920> musicians<00:05:16.690> one<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.780> the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
callosum than known musicians one of the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.020 
callosum than known musicians one of the
main<00:05:18.080> things<00:05:18.410> they<00:05:18.650> noticed<00:05:19.100> was<00:05:19.700> this

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
main things they noticed was this

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.140 
main things they noticed was this
consistent<00:05:20.720> stimuli<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.560> practice<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.760> in

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
consistent stimuli of practice and in

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.030 
consistent stimuli of practice and in
this<00:05:23.240> case<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.960> type<00:05:24.470> of<00:05:24.500> practice<00:05:24.920> they're

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
this case the type of practice they're

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.650 
this case the type of practice they're
talking<00:05:25.340> about<00:05:25.400> is<00:05:25.580> greater<00:05:25.880> than<00:05:26.120> one<00:05:26.510> hour

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
talking about is greater than one hour

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.980 
talking about is greater than one hour
per<00:05:26.960> day<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.980> this<00:05:28.100> is<00:05:28.220> different<00:05:28.990> potentially

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990
