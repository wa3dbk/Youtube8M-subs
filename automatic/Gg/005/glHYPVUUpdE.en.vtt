00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 just talk to some of your 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.759
 friends to already find someone who 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.980
 have a galaxy y if the device does not bring 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.020
 cutting-edge hardware does not prevent 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.170
 it performs well and does enough 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 success so nothing is fairer than 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.290
 he also receives a bit of our 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
 attention 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.610
 many people who have a smartphone want 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 explore the device a little more 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.870
 good opportunity to start doing this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 is performing roth 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:42.929
 so do not waste time and learn how 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 attention when routing the appliance 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.760
 you take various risks 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 one of them is to completely lose 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 assurance of your gadgets programs that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.379
 use the access granted by ruth 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.379
 can also damage your phone 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.670
 there is still a risk of locking 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.519
 your phone 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.600
 then be aware and think well before 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.549
 decide to continue with the procedure 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 to perform ruch on your galaxy and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.009
 first of all you need to copy some 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 files into your smartphone 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.140
 are these files that perform all the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.750
 complex unlocking procedures 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 of your device, be aware of the model 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 from your phone 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.200
 otherwise the process will not work 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.299
 access the link that is in the description for 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.259
 download the correct files to your 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.590
 appliance 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 after downloading the data 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.649
 connect your device's cable to your 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.479
 computer and enable USB storage and 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.820
 then simply copied the file 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.759
 downloaded to the root of your 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.429
 you do not need to create any 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.359
 folder or tinkering with anything inside your 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.880
 galaxy y after doing so check out 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.560
 copied the correct file closes the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 windows of your computer 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.869
 disable bulk storage and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.030
 turn off your smartphone 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.940
 now you will need to enter the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.120
 recovery of your device to make 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.740
 that on the galaxy and insecure home buttons o 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.880
 volume up 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.240
 power simultaneously after some 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 the recovery screen will appear 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 as soon as the letters appear to release 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
 all buttons at the same time 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.780
 in the recovery menu notice that the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.670
 screen does not recognize your touches 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.670
 so that navigation needs to be 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.830
 performed by the physical buttons 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.410
 so use the volume buttons 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.450
 to go up and down and home to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.270
 choose the desired option 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.000
 everything is very easy just that you go down 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.540
 the second alternative and select 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.520
 wide and update from sd card there use 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.950
 the volume keys again to 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.710
 browse files looking for 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.330
 The one you just copied from the pc 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.250
 for your phone 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.770
 to find it all you need 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.630
 do is select it by pressing 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.240
 then the home key 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.890
 after that the ruth process will happen 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.600
 automatically 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.640
 quickly your device will be 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 unlocked and you can follow 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.550
 all through the progress bar 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.340
 at the bottom of the screen when everything 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.890
 you back to the home screen of the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.980
 recovery menu there 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.830
 press the ibooks terminal on your galaxy and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.570
 will be restarted and this time you should 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.560
 allow the appliance to be switched on 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.560
 normally 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.280
 when the android is on just 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.950
 look for the program called super user 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.990
 if the application is installed this 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.000
 means that you have succeeded in 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.120
 all procedures and that your 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.310
 galaxy y is unlocked 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.680
 if you have repented and want 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.970
 discuss your android this is also 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.459
 simple task 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.740
 in fact the process is exactly the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.030
 even when it was time to unlock the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.120
 you guedes 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.250
 so first of all download the file that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.769
 matches your smartphone 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.350
 realize that now you need another 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.320
 able to lock your device 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.410
 then performs exactly the same 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.060
 steps of the ruth process ie copy 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.910
 the data for your cell phone 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.390

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.250
 procedure 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.919
 then just restart the gadget to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.280
 realize that the super user has disappeared and 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.760
