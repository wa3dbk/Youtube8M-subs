00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.320
 as always having a new video and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.720
 good background gameplay people will be 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.029
 watching a little game of resident evil 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.259
 revelations in wayne mode that is 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 more or less as a kind of 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.090
 mercenary you go back to the worlds 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.030
 good the spaces that went through the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.780
 campaign but with variation of monsters 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.640
 arms levels this things that do that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.010
 the good game is a little bit more more 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.050
 broad and good the reason for this video is 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 who already know that it will come out grace level 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 revelations for what is coming 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.140
 beginning of the next year you know that 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.180
 is bringing them news information and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.979
 everything and in fact soon they wait for them 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.230
 bringing another video are some theories or 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.360
 issues that have been coming 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.390
 but in this video I what I want them 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.980
 ask is if they would like it 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.920
 let's play the resident evil campaign 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.580
 revelations 1 this campaign I already the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.500
 I played 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.869
 in fact I tried to upload it to the channel but 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.850
 at that time that one year later I had 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.040
 nothing else what has been the laptop 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 good a laptop with which he recorded and 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.910
 with which it all and obviously good 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.680
 to make campaign chapters was 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.560
 horrible because 20 minute videos 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.270
 it takes two hours and well I did not have the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.400
 connection to upload the videos fast 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.020
 then basically you can only upload 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.660
 like five or six videos like 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 custom but that's not because I do not 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.830
 I wanted to be that was because it gave me a lot 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.530
 work surrender and climb every Friday 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.550
 then but the reality is that if 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.750
 had all the chapters already recorded what 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.810
 What happens is that the laptop was 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.280
 lose and well then all the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.179
 chapters if we stay we think that in the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.920
 78 or something like that in the channel and that 's it is 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.130
 a game that I would not like to leave 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.690
 so nothing else I have two options 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.920
 because I said and done this in right now 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.990
 that will come in two because I want 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.070
 replay the first campaign because 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.520
 almost 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.320
 and then to remember especially the game 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 and enter warm what comes 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.459
 being the revelations 2 I have two 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.740
 options continue the campaign from 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.430
 where I stayed but that I do have to see 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 the videos this 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.450
 You can see exactly where I stayed and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.609
 move forward because in the campaign it does not 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.560
 you're recorded as the said I finished it 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.900
 will have to start over and move forward 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.920
 on my own to where I stayed in 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.180
 that then and then follow it and start 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.939
 to upload the chapter that would come 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.489
 8 or so but personally I 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.500
 like to delete all its chapters this 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.889
 and let him start why then because 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.629
 already has a year like that so that 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.819
 do not be scattered by all that there are people 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.480
 that entered the channel and that obviously 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.709
 this case no no I do not know what I thought 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.609
 a year ago when you're doing the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.739
 campaign and I kind of like the thread of 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.689
 comment not of the role so it was going 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.879
 trying everything I think would be better 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.829
 To start over I say there were not many or 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.689
 and 15-minute chapters or not 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.200
 we carry nothing the campaign I think it is 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.959
 much better to start it again 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.330
 and above all to live it together 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.730
 new all because then comes the 2 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.890
 this one said whiting then I want to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.830
 to start climbing terror campaigns and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 everything right now in this game is 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.380
 I'd pretty good start 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.480
 upload them and done I have this already separated 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760
 my little money to buy the drawing 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.610
 within you will also be seeing the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.310
 channel and possibly that of the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.140
 revelations right now I do not believe doing the 2.0 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.060
 because then it's not a matter of so much 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.069
 scare and everything and besides I already had not 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.510
 and suddenly here I know will come out a 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.260
 zombie or what's going to be a monster that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.260
 it would be like very 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.680
 is very successful or not assume 2.0 without 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.370
 However, if you want to put 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.860
 comments 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.970
 I already see what I can do for 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.130
 wheeling this 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.230
 yes I think it's going to be 2.0 because this 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.100
 campaign will surely take a hair 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.100
 what other 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.560
 and many more then it's the revelations 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.599
 2 I do not know how it depends on this 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.430
 then more than anything this video is for 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.169
 to be entertained and gameplay of 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.970
 done frame mode even if not 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.710
 they want the campaign we can bring videos 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.900
 of the engine sold the campaign good and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.580
 I will play obviously because the truce but 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.990
 if they want videos of the rights not 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.759
 they want the campaign through which 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.320
 because suddenly they are not interested 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.910
 I'm going to bring game fish like this one with 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.320
 Live comments talking about other 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.300
 things the truth is great because 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.250
 you pass as you relive the scenarios of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.800
 the campaign but also the intensity 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.690
 of many weapons ingredients 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.220
 you can play with several good characters 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.800
 you're playing with jill in fact it's not the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510
 original suit of understanding of bus or 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.240
 revelations and it's not wiese's and whoever 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.620
 certainly as good a super spoiler 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.430
 I 'm not reading an information so 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.610
 nothing to see this 6 a girl contention 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.560
 or I do not know what internet mom 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.780
 the pre-master level president of 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.389
 mastered of the YouTube rememberto 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.449
 he resides in one of the mansion but for 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.460
 new generation in a nutshell and 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.139
 this one reached a goal and I do not know what mom the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.659
 point is that they are going to give us the costumes of 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.969
 beauty and geely of crisis I think that 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.319
 It's super good but I do not know if they were 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.030
 for those who participated in that 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.729
 foolish to infect the city of bacon 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.400
 city or for all minimum I am 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.819
 participant so of one or the other then I 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.740
 They will give the costume not then then nothing 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.029
 people is more than anything was that for 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.860
 ask them I hope you liked the 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.029
 gameplay leave in the comments what 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.860
 they think they want if the campaign 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:41.060
 complete start they want the 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.919
 continue or want this 2.0 or leave 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.219
 you all everything you want to say 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.229
 that's what the section of 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.759
 comments and I those of all for 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.120
 start uploading the campaign because good 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.460
 I had not had time to make videos 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.780
 but if I did not feel like starting 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.699
 play the campaign but had not been able 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.380
 because I wanted to ask you this like this 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.199
 because they wanted it because suddenly 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.139
 the same serves as of suddenly entente 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.750
 I become detached I have a university job 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.250
 deliver letter and good this remains the same 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.260
 kind of videos so that always 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.240
 have in the channel and everything so then 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.070
 good people more than anything is so that 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.870
 leave your comments and as not if not 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.280
 those who want, they did not leave me like and 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.690
 helped the channel so much that more 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.949
 people find out and suddenly they want 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.990
 revive the campaign upside down and level 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.110
 revelations 1 then we can do it 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.340
 together and if not more than demanding not 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.690
 forget to subscribe to the channel actions to 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.979
 subscribed for more error videos and 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.530
 of level that comes a lot 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.490
 content to the channel in these months both 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.729
 in strobel them as the 2 as he 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.130
 as the remastered until we are 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.919
 comes a little essence to the channel 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.810
 as no levels version are defined 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.819
 of channel so let's go back to the one 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.250
 A little bit of people and good, well, if not 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.690
 See you next time and leave their 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.190
 comments seriously I need that I 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.930
 say that you hit but to go to the 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.930
 I just do it myself and bring you something else
