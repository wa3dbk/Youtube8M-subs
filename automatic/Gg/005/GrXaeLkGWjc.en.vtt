00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello big little people 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.340
 tanks today with you tour and this 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.950
 long-awaited replay for me 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.620
 because I was not sick at that time 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 only they are comfortable to write 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.119
 rivers of indigirka and now your 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.750
 I present to attention a guide on the mouse 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.240
 In general, I want you ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 learned to think outside the box 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.149
 standard in terms of what would be expensive 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.700
 you had u broken and you think they 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.320
 let's go to town 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.190
 lock yourself in there and hold some thread 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 the region there is no there and west 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.780
 think broader the point is that here as you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 see our opponents big 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.010
 the number of medium tanks and of course 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.120
 for sure they will go to Zelenka 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.170
 nightmare our artillery and our 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.829
 few among allies which 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.500
 let it be just two 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 so therefore i decide that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 Basically due to my armor and me 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 a chance to give our artillery a bit 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 live and make at least one two 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.520
 shot and somehow 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 at least something to farm in this battle and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.820
 as you can see I send myself to learn from 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820
 average 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.780
 simplifying the seemingly strange solution 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.770
 but as you can see she is generally enough 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.890
 true why because for what first 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 queue has a mouse of course 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.729
 excellent reservations and a large margin 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.119
 hp that will allow himself to live some 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.259
 time and give our allies 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 opportunities to shoot at the enemy and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.180
 maybe even shoot artillery 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 what do we have going on here like me 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.640
 see in fear two ally is t-54 110 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 5 they drove the world 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.870
 where is this threatening us statistics 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 there is that there is no more they 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.080
 wanted to get into the TV or in advance 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 got hit 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.880
 but generally more to wait on them 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.820
 I do n't have to say hi sundresses I know 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.760
 I wanted to say hello to my mother I was his 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.510
 you before about and as you see we 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.350
 We start to get there little by little 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.090
 him up 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.580
 Oleg A. He agrees with me 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.580
 here and actually do damage from himself 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.640
 as lithium, we went with the guard with 607 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.780
 damage in battsat and this is very, very my 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.310
 look nice 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.519
 I didn't even know what actually was 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.269
 that gun can do about 600 damage 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.390
 units 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.090
 well, then quietly shoot and sit down 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.300
 and we are not too afraid for the fact that 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.970
 the gun for spring is weak though 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.600
 rate of fire but weak and so that we have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.480
 happened here we have our allies two 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.150
 medium tank ended here i'm here 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.910
 here hurry from 154 on was wait 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.640
 until you pass well and as you can see 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.700
 the enemy has already destroyed one of ours 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.590
 artillery this principle was expected i 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.860
 I donâ€™t think she will live there 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.860
 plenty of time here waffle 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.650
 I did my unpleasant business I finished it 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.940
 In Amarillo this script is a place about what not 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.340
 hardly and do not regret 54 1 leave of course 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.590
 nice but i understand that he is not coming 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.810
 and surrender therefore I myself am in a hurry 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.190
 I continue to pull one more 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.530
 our artillery is dying 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.799
 but no less so as you can see ladies and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.590
 Gentlemen, we have stood here and head 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.049
 Tomorrow their tanks and in general, then in some 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.530
 degrees are still alive till you lost half 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.380
 hepe but we have to shoot well and 1600 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.430
 quietly 62 swab shoots 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.280
 not very scary for us is that we 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.040
 happens 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.660
 or our city they took it now 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:09.280
 surround and to me i see an egg and 215 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.380
 good tank but of course in terms of again 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 fighting medium tanks there of course 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.359
 not perfect as you can see konkor gets 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.660
 t-54 alone here remains one unfortunate 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.020
 t-62a 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.430
 yes yes yes and of all this huge 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.530
 huge hordes that attacked us 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.750
 there is only one tank left and we 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 successfully continue to keep and wear damage 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.960
 i'm almaden coming soon here 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.660
 missed 54 hurried and then yes 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.350
 our gun allows you to shoot and apply 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.210
 damage and here you flash drive it surrounds it 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.700
 apparently 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.850
 a mob or a clear track without 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.080
 damage it of course they just once again don't 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.770
 punched hats here hold it 62a 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.200
 but here we lock and flies to me 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.690
 artillery battsat 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.479
 pushes 62 this one like any funny 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.320
 I understand the story 52 to be complicated 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.850
 shoot back so the tower is already turned 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.500
 more from trying to pursue I understand 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.660
 that he came here apparently with 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 one projectile here he gets 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.650
 unions of delirium and his to be 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.830
 rayot and what tia get last 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.200
 Well, of course, there are two opponents 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.200
 artillery for us this is in no way 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.210
 scary here ladies and gentlemen just such 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.120
 way we kept the raid on the base 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.530
 medium tanks as they could shoot out 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.350
 even one art rescued 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.200
 and she paid you for it I helped the ladies and 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.650
 gentlemen think outside the box your score 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.260
