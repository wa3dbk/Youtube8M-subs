00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
a difficult install at first once you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
a difficult install at first once you
kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.690> used<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.829> know<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.100> goes

half-dozen<00:03:15.540> times<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> imagine<00:03:16.890> over<00:03:17.250> time

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
half-dozen times so I imagine over time

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.610 
half-dozen times so I imagine over time
you<00:03:18.300> know<00:03:18.330> I'll<00:03:18.510> get<00:03:18.690> more<00:03:18.900> used<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> it's

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you know I'll get more used to it it's

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.590 
you know I'll get more used to it it's
just<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.860> little<00:03:20.220> kind<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.239> move

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
just that little kind of you know move

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.180 
just that little kind of you know move
at<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> end<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.290> straightens<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:22.950> out

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
at the end that straightens it all out

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.710 
at the end that straightens it all out
but<00:03:23.459> once<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:23.970> installed<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.630> a

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
but once you have it installed it's a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.750 
but once you have it installed it's a
really<00:03:25.019> seamless<00:03:25.500> look<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.430> see<00:03:26.610> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
back is completely clear at least in the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.800 
back is completely clear at least in the
version<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:29.820> are<00:03:29.940> five<00:03:30.180> colors<00:03:30.600> of

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it and remember this material is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.360 
it and remember this material is
self-healing<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.290> will<00:03:34.500> kind<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.280> know
