00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Today I am going to teach you the ideas of 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.460
 snacks or snacks that I do every time 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.020
 I want to eat something good but 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 healthy to avoid feeling guilty 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 then the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 some rice pancakes with butter 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.600
 of peanuts and jam and in this case then 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 the preparation is quite easy 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.789
 super simple just going to need 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.920
 apply then to the rice paste the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500
 butter and a half first can be 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 AusÃ s how genes want me here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 like to apply more peanut butter 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.079
 what jam and then after that I apply 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 they see a little bit of jam and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.570
 true that this is a plate that is super 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 super good for before going to the gym 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 before doing any kind of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 physical activity including breakfast 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.940
 many times ice as well so I 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 fascinates and also that it fills a lot if 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.920
 you are in a hurry is an option 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.810
 super super easy now let's do 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.090
 some companies and in 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.070
 then chocolate covered quotes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.830
 but instead of chocolate we are going to use 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 yogurt then let's cover them with 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.230
 our ground and grated coconut and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.010
 optionally they can put in the middle 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.020
 a little bit of maple syrup or honey 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.360
 for the preparation it's super easy just 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.980
 they need as they saw a little boat 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 yogurt can use natural yogurt 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.660
 also but in this case yogurt from 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 peach and what we are going to do is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.110
 take the strawberry and we're going to dip it in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.440
 the yogurt to stimulate that chocolate 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.870
 and once we 've done that we're going to 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.060
 pass it by the grated coconut 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.580
 It fascinates me to make it with grated coconut 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 because it gives a super tropical touch and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.780
 it tastes very very very rich and especially for 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.760
 those days you want something sweet that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.650
 you want to eat a chocolate that you want 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 something very heavy this helped a lot 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.270
 because the nuts because it feels like 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.700
 you were eating something heavy 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 and it is not so that they really are 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.920
 I recommend very much you know divine and with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.440
 the touch of maple or honey in the middle 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 It gives a super sweet touch and super super 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.369
 really rich that if you have never done 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.350
 this they have to do it especially if 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.640
 they love strawberries covered 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.709
 chocolate 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.020
 for those who want something salty 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.940
 let's make a parboiled egg 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.820
 super healthy for it we are going to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.280
 need garlic powder salt and a 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.370
 little bit of cayenne pepper but 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.989
 these options 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 the first thing they want to do for 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.030
 course is to remove the shell to your 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.099
 Parboiled grandpa then they will itch 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
 in half and they will remove the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.030
 yellow is emotional if you do not 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.549
 they are taking too much care of their diet 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.620
 do not do it but I like to do it 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.900
 especially if they are taking care of their 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.670
 fat consumption and everything else but 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.769
 I do not like being too strict with 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.680
 this is a little bit if not me 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.480
 matter and then if I eat it the same and now 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.390
 what we are going to do is apply a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.549
 little bit of garlic powder 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 this gives a supermicro touch it seems 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.560
 that he was eating real meat 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.390
 it tastes super super rich and then I'm going to 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.129
 apply a few strokes of pepper 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.859
 cayena just because I like monkeys 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.129
 spicy and gives a super rich touch and a 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.530
 little salt do not go away so much 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.629
 with salt because you already know that it is not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.629
 nothing good but your kidneys so just 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.940
 a little bit to enhance the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.920
 flavors but not know super salty 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.680
 then accompany it with toast 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.359
 integral of course and you can 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.829
 eat then first the eggs and 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.580
 after the toast or can put the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.200
 eggs on top 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.720
 on the toast that is what I like the most 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.520
 do and really know divine so already 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.760
 you know they can make healthy snacks not 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.140
 matter if they are sweet if they are salty 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.690
 but always try to make it as 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.880
 healthy if they were left wanting 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.370
