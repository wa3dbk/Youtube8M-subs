you buy there physically the same size

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.060 
you buy there physically the same size
it's<00:00:48.730> just<00:00:48.790> slightly<00:00:49.720> more<00:00:49.870> expense<00:00:50.470> lightly

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
it's just slightly more expense lightly

either familiar with it or you're not

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900 
either familiar with it or you're not
but<00:01:01.420> in<00:01:02.050> any<00:01:02.230> event<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:03.190> really<00:01:03.640> just

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
but in any event this really just

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.319 
but in any event this really just
simplifies<00:01:05.130> and-and-and<00:01:06.130> problem<00:01:06.850> solves

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
simplifies and-and-and problem solves

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.920 
simplifies and-and-and problem solves
for<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:08.079> basic<00:01:08.710> battery<00:01:09.009> connection<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.780> can

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
for a basic battery connection you can

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.600 
for a basic battery connection you can
see<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.259> it<00:01:11.380> adds<00:01:11.590> very<00:01:11.799> little<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
see that it adds very little to the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.270 
see that it adds very little to the
height<00:01:12.790> of<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:13.000> battery<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.079> adds<00:01:14.289> 0<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
height of a battery and it adds 0 to the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.629 
height of a battery and it adds 0 to the
length<00:01:15.579> or<00:01:15.819> width<00:01:17.249> once<00:01:18.249> it's<00:01:18.399> connected

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
length or width once it's connected

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.700 
length or width once it's connected
though<00:01:18.999> you've<00:01:19.749> got<00:01:20.130> nice<00:01:21.130> clean<00:01:21.729> secure

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
though you've got nice clean secure

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.410 
though you've got nice clean secure
Andersen<00:01:23.710> connections<00:01:24.249> one<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.179> them<00:01:25.299> is

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
Andersen connections one of them is

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.199 
Andersen connections one of them is
fused<00:01:25.810> one<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.469> them<00:01:26.560> is<00:01:26.709> not<00:01:26.889> and<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.819> can<00:01:27.850> see

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
fused one of them is not and you can see

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.399 
fused one of them is not and you can see
the<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.990> plate<00:01:29.259> here<00:01:29.530> says<00:01:29.979> fused<00:01:30.369> or<00:01:30.579> unfused

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the the plate here says fused or unfused

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.230 
the the plate here says fused or unfused
and<00:01:32.789> you've<00:01:33.789> got<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.979> inline<00:01:35.979> blade<00:01:36.609> type<00:01:36.909> fuse

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
and you've got a inline blade type fuse

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.300 
and you've got a inline blade type fuse
we<00:01:37.539> include<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.990> 5<00:01:38.170> amp<00:01:38.380> fuse<00:01:38.709> obviously<00:01:39.219> you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
we include a 5 amp fuse obviously you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.709 
we include a 5 amp fuse obviously you
could<00:01:39.459> change<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.909> for<00:01:40.119> your<00:01:40.240> own<00:01:40.299> needs<00:01:40.539> if

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
could change that for your own needs if

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.050 
could change that for your own needs if
you<00:01:40.749> needed<00:01:40.959> to<00:01:41.079> you've<00:01:42.009> also<00:01:42.159> got<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.429> switch

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
you needed to you've also got a switch

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.989 
you needed to you've also got a switch
that's<00:01:43.299> embedded<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:43.929> protected<00:01:44.499> and

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
that's embedded it's protected and

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.050 
that's embedded it's protected and
that's<00:01:45.999> which<00:01:46.329> activates<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:46.959> voltmeter

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that's which activates the voltmeter

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
that's which activates the voltmeter
which<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.179> great<00:01:49.420> obviously<00:01:50.020> at<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.170> point

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
which is great obviously at that point

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.339 
which is great obviously at that point
you<00:01:51.340> know<00:01:51.520> before<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.060> go<00:01:52.659> out<00:01:52.779> the<00:01:52.899> door<00:01:53.079> if

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
you know before you go out the door if

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.819 
you know before you go out the door if
you've<00:01:53.590> got<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.829> good<00:01:54.729> charge<00:01:54.999> on<00:01:55.209> your<00:01:55.299> battery

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you've got a good charge on your battery

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.190 
you've got a good charge on your battery
you<00:01:56.829> have<00:01:56.859> some<00:01:57.459> sort<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.819> idea<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.599> how<00:01:58.929> well

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
you have some sort of idea of how well

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.209 
you have some sort of idea of how well
the<00:01:59.380> battery<00:01:59.709> is<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.969> taking<00:02:01.599> a<00:02:01.689> charge<00:02:01.929> or<00:02:02.409> how

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
the battery is is taking a charge or how

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.679 
the battery is is taking a charge or how
quickly<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.759> losing<00:02:03.999> energy<00:02:04.179> of<00:02:04.539> its

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
quickly it's losing energy of its

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.690 
quickly it's losing energy of its
running<00:02:04.899> equipment<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.950> not<00:02:06.130> quite<00:02:06.429> as<00:02:06.549> nice

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
running equipment it's not quite as nice

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.880 
running equipment it's not quite as nice
as<00:02:06.939> an<00:02:07.029> ammeter<00:02:07.389> of<00:02:07.599> course<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.289> at<00:02:08.740> least

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
as an ammeter of course but at least

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
as an ammeter of course but at least
it's<00:02:09.130> better<00:02:09.160> than<00:02:09.399> being<00:02:09.700> completely

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
it's better than being completely

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.089 
it's better than being completely
blinded<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.050> anyway<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.560> our<00:02:11.800> original

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
blinded so anyway this is our original

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.810 
blinded so anyway this is our original
backpack<00:02:12.819> what<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> want<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.780> show<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.990> today

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.780 

was<00:02:17.820> its<00:02:19.190> little<00:02:20.190> brother<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
was its little brother this is the the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.480 
was its little brother this is the the
same<00:02:23.970> unit<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.170> by<00:02:25.470> same<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.980> mean<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> only

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
same unit and by same I mean the only

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.510 
same unit and by same I mean the only
difference<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.180> size<00:02:27.450> same<00:02:28.350> components<00:02:29.040> same
