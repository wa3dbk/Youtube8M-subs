00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
notice that the screen is edge to edge

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.389 
notice that the screen is edge to edge
but<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.199> small<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:32.040> edge

design<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.670> personal<00:00:51.059> opinions<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.480> not

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
design my personal opinions it's not

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
design my personal opinions it's not
going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> happen<00:00:52.039> but<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.280> /<00:00:53.670> designed<00:00:54.000> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
going to happen but if / designed this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340 
going to happen but if / designed this
does<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> happen<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
does think it's going to happen so I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.119 
does think it's going to happen so I
guess<00:00:55.710> might<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.340> possible<00:00:57.079> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> last

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
guess might be possible in the last

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.349 
guess might be possible in the last
picture<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.789> see<00:00:59.910> how<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> volume

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
picture you can see how the volume

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
picture you can see how the volume
rockers<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.260> indented<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
rockers have now an indented in the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.329 
rockers have now an indented in the
middle<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.210> deliver<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.799> riffing

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
middle so you can deliver do the riffing

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
middle so you can deliver do the riffing
here<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.390> find<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.470> difference<00:01:07.860> between

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
here you can find the difference between

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
here you can find the difference between
the<00:01:08.250> bump<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.049> volume<00:01:10.049> rocker<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.560> let's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the bump on the volume rocker so let's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.230 
the bump on the volume rocker so let's
say<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.830> want<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> increase<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> volume<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
say you want to increase the volume you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
say you want to increase the volume you
can<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.510> feel<00:01:12.960> their<00:01:13.229> arm<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
can actually feel their arm where it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
can actually feel their arm where it
gets<00:01:14.280> separated<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.360> low<00:01:15.540> volume

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
gets separated from the low volume

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
gets separated from the low volume
because<00:01:16.259> before<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> normal<00:01:18.060> iphone<00:01:18.210> 4

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
because before with the normal iphone 4

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.620 
because before with the normal iphone 4
you<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:19.590> only<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.640> feel

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the volume rockers you could fill out

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.080 
the volume rockers you could fill out
the<00:01:23.280> iphone<00:01:23.430> 4<00:01:24.020> with<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> ipod<00:01:25.680> touch<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.340> an

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
rockers with the iphone 4 they actually

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
rockers with the iphone 4 they actually
made<00:01:44.490> two<00:01:44.700> separate<00:01:45.060> buttons<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.290> kind

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
made two separate buttons so this kind

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.249 
made two separate buttons so this kind
of<00:01:46.649> um<00:01:47.450> indent<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> middle<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> goes

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of um indent in the middle when it goes

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.039 
of um indent in the middle when it goes
like<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.439> um<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> kind

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
like this um it kind of because it kind

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.480 
like this um it kind of because it kind
of<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> better<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.829> feel<00:01:53.280> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
of is better because you can feel like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.840 
of is better because you can feel like
it<00:01:53.790> fits<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.899> I'm<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> hold<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.549> your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it fits in I'm when you hold it your

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
it fits in I'm when you hold it your
thumb<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:58.009> grooved<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> middle<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
thumb will be a grooved in the middle so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
thumb will be a grooved in the middle so
it<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.210> more<00:02:00.420> comfortable<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.170> guess<00:02:01.380> um<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it is more comfortable I guess um in the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
it is more comfortable I guess um in the
know<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> last<00:02:04.740> picture<00:02:04.979> around

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
know that was on the last picture around

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.469 
know that was on the last picture around
in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> last<00:02:05.700> picture<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.329> how<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
in the last picture you can see how the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.559 
in the last picture you can see how the
camera<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> bottom<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> more

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
camera and the bottom is more

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.449 
camera and the bottom is more
downer<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:09.499> still<00:02:10.099> on<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.399> left<00:02:10.609> side<00:02:10.939> um<00:02:11.329> I

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
downer but still on the left side um I

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.559 
downer but still on the left side um I
think<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:13.670> not<00:02:13.909> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> happen<00:02:14.239> either

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
think this is not going to happen either

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.089 
think this is not going to happen either

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
down and the actual whole top bar is now

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.839 
down and the actual whole top bar is now
you<00:02:29.329> know<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.459> they<00:02:31.459> actually<00:02:31.700> add<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
you know I'm in the they actually add a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.479 
you know I'm in the they actually add a
little<00:02:32.060> black<00:02:32.450> little<00:02:32.959> Wi-Fi<00:02:33.829> signal<00:02:34.219> in<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
little black little Wi-Fi signal in the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.569 
little black little Wi-Fi signal in the
directly<00:02:35.000> middle<00:02:35.329> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.010> phone<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.370> very

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
directly middle of the phone to the very

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.009 
directly middle of the phone to the very
top<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.030> phone<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.510> picture<00:02:38.840> you'll<00:02:38.959> see

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
top the phone in the picture you'll see

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.020 
top the phone in the picture you'll see
um<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:40.189> basically<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.609> think<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:40.879> is<00:02:40.969> very

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
um to basically I think this is very

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.569 
um to basically I think this is very
nice<00:02:41.329> so<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.569> guess<00:02:41.870> um<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.829> get<00:02:43.040> more<00:02:43.159> Wi-Fi

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
nice so I guess um you get more Wi-Fi

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.409 
nice so I guess um you get more Wi-Fi
connection<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.090> way<00:02:44.469> hopefully<00:02:45.469> this<00:02:45.980> is

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
connection this way hopefully this is

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.000 
connection this way hopefully this is
hopefully<00:02:47.419> some<00:02:47.900> aspects<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.439> these<00:02:48.650> designs

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
hopefully some aspects of these designs

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.679 
hopefully some aspects of these designs
don't<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.459> implemented<00:02:49.819> because<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.329> highly

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
don't get implemented because I highly

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.059 
don't get implemented because I highly
doubt<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.469> going<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.620> be<00:02:51.709> physically

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
doubt that it's going to be physically

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.170 
doubt that it's going to be physically
possible<00:02:52.250> i'm<00:02:52.609> just<00:02:52.730> going<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:52.939> look<00:02:53.000> ugly

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
possible i'm just going to look ugly

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.330 
possible i'm just going to look ugly
like<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> actual<00:02:54.199> shape<00:02:54.469> of<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.799> does<00:02:55.159> look

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
like the actual shape of it does look

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.819 
like the actual shape of it does look
pretty<00:02:55.489> ugly<00:02:55.879> if<00:02:55.939> you<00:02:56.000> think<00:02:56.239> about<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.480> um

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
pretty ugly if you think about it um

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.990 
pretty ugly if you think about it um
like<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:57.919> said<00:02:57.949> I<00:02:58.069> think<00:02:58.129> apple<00:02:58.609> will<00:02:58.639> stick

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
like I said I think apple will stick

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.939 
like I said I think apple will stick
