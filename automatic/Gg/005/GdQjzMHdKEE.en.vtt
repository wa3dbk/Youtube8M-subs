 the video shows a patient who could not walk without using a cane 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.380
 you notice a serious insubria you notice a serious deformity of the left foot 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.970
 the toe in the flexed towards the equine floor 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.320
 the ankle who knows it does not articulate the patient has suffered a serious accident 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.550
 with trimalleolar fracture 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 he has had surgery several times but his ankle has remained the incident form 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.270
 the x-ray shows the patient's two ankles compared to the side 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.630
 right shows the healthy joint on the left side shows the joint 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.210
 prey to severe arthrosis the fibula still fractured years later 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.410
 since the accident a screwer has remained that deftly put the movement back 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.209
 articular 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.219
 the ankle is severely deviated towards the outside before performing the operation 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.560
 of prostheses it is necessary to correct these serious conditions of misalignment 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 instability 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.310
 frontal radiograph of the ankle demonstrates fracture healing 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.740
 of the fibula, a plate-fixed bone transplant was performed 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 screws the ankle back in line with the leg 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.070
 the frontal radiograph of the ankle shows the presence of the prosthesis of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 ankle the prosthetic components appear correctly aligned 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.760
 the video shows the animated radiograph of the ankle performed at the end 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.469
 of surgery 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.409
 the components of the prosthesis are evident 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.020
 it is noted that the tibial component of and astragalic 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.720
 the joint movement that was in the bone is firmly in the summer 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.360
 completely absent before surgery appears restored
