thought my whole deck relied on valleys
and<00:02:37.000> they<00:02:37.360> were<00:02:37.450> citing<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:37.870> stupid

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and they were citing like stupid

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.340 
and they were citing like stupid
like<00:02:38.560> light<00:02:39.250> mirrors<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.090> just<00:02:40.330> totally<00:02:41.140> dead

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
cards that were trying to get rid of my

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.470 
cards that were trying to get rid of my
values<00:02:44.380> cyber<00:02:44.620> dragons<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.460> stuff<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.360> of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
course I cited it out so they cited in

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.520 
course I cited it out so they cited in
two<00:02:48.550> useless<00:02:48.730> cards<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:50.200> that's<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
two useless cards I think that's one of
