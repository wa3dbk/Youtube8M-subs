00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.090
 have you noticed that on youtube lately 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.530
 something different is happening 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.589
 let's start with the assumption that I don't 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.630
 I'm a youtuber but there isn't any 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.480
 nothing or almost that I love more than 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.220
 youtube italia that of my case but 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.660
 I'm not the only one I'm that typical 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.369
 user who for a few years following 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 Gameplay of video games that you don't 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.849
 could buy called review of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 video games that went out 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.410
 of the ordinary of shabby and trashy movies 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.210
 that when he was younger he went to 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.420
 school came home to watch a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.750
 boy with a wig for then 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.850
 get away from certain formats or for a while 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 I wanted to go against the current and I gave 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.050
 I listen to furious madmen who criticized 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.930
 left and right for one in particular 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.710
 I was almost losing a reason for it 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.140
 I'm not the only one of us on the internet 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.900
 surrounded by social network chat 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.060
 cutting-edge tablet PC platforms 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.070
 that make you video call in Japan and 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.909
 cell phone that take wifi even from 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.729
 street lamps but they are all bullshit 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.330
 because between facebook skype town reddit and 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.020
 twitter we of the internet are people 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.090
 sun we hold a notification or the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.900
 quote from a TV series to hear us 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.240
 less alone 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.549
 we want to be seen admired e 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.710
 idolized to bring down the monster of 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.380
 inferiority complex that only 0 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 limestone could draw because 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.320
 youtuber are so important to us 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.740
 of the internet because they are people like 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.710
 we 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.560
 a difference they don't have enough 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.119
 ball is enough charisma to say 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.490
 what they believe in 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.020
 then we bend to them one later 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.240
 the other we gather in anonymous 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.030
 views in comments that don't 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.860
 they will never be read for what we do 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.080
 podcasts and shared platforms on 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.700
 facebook of big names of channels without 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.310
 purpose like chasing dogs 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.409
 machines baiano wheels but I will not 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.490
 say things already said or continue to 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.440
 talk about it because otherwise 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.540
 they would become limitations like many others 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.700
 I just want you to be accountable for one 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.520
 what do you use dini and rags on 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.310
 head are things you find in bizzoche 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.610
 of country since bloggers are 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.600
 become the modern transposition of the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.780
 comari youtube italia has transformed 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.560
 in a huge condominium where the care 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.880
 tenants extend their sheets and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 gossip on the spots of the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.600
 their neighbor's sheets that 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.250
 the tenant downstairs e 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.780
 recommended because he made a 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.360
 special contract with the administrator 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 that the neighbor of the landing does it 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.350
 with the engineer of the top floor e 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.610
 who knows how many other subtle examples 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.160
 I could do not see why it is so 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.710
 difficult to take responsibility 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080
 of one's actions and one says so 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.760
 person who defended another for months 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.710
 person hiding behind a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.500
 character but above all us 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.130
 viewers of all these meetings of 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.600
 outdoor condominium fucks us 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.600
 really so much
