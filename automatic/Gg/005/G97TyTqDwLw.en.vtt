00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.460
 so quiet tug out or maybe not I do not know you can 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.740
 You'll see if the Motorola Flipout makes you freak out 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.339
 the charming weird one 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.680
 that's the packaging of the device and that's what it looks like 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.380
 ever look and he is something very special 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.119
 who here we see some technical data here the device from the side 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 do not even take out yourself 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.990
 that's the Motorola Flipout and that's it 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 Small square practically good that is the question here 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.319
 like the one in the SWT men to videos but from the first impression ago 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.549
 of course the device is very very small I have to be very very close to the 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:47.319
 camera 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.720
 So she wants to go 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.370
 yes that's the device anymore that's not 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.380
 of course, a little more Cologne is here namely a mass 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.740
 fold down 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.170
 that's why 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.230
 Flat out 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 that's how it looks 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.040
 here we have a qwerty keyboard with some special characters like that in the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.560
 Operation works I show you too 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.090
 yes, but that's how it looks like 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.120
 It is clear that you can pack a different way a device 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.110
 that's what the device looks like it's a smartphone that offers us a lot and it 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 fits very well in your pocket that you have to say 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.150
 it's small enough for that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.730
 the animal is mayflies and real so we really have one here 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.060
 compact device 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.000
 if that is compact now and still good we have to fail together 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.850
 First we can see what we see from the outside, we have dimensions 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.649
 was us 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.630
 7 60 centimeters 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.650
 who surprised especially 67 centimeters Hessian square 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.850
 May 16 centimeters of the thickest point is still possible 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 to be that he is relatively small 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 yes what more, we still lead up here 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830
 once the volume rocker 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.610
 or is it now why am I up here then he is not up anymore 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.470
 that is up here and now we have the on-off switch and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.849
 we have a side make millimeter jack for headphones 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.620
 On the right side 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.430
 we have the input for the Mac OS Decade and here below it finds its 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.089
 small so a niche Bush for the battery can take the stove 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.459
 the sky again the volume rocker 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.799
 yes that's a little irritating that it's not just about what it's about 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.229
 you feel that your soprano is out 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.489
 under 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.079
 yes that is the question once where must interpret in please please name one 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.059
 said three-megapixel camera front has screenshot player percent and the a 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.749
 Sophie for the first time to the device from the outside that looks like Wittlich lot of hate 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.629
 Mischa and that is included 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.419
 and salt on the year still out 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.429
 and Mehmedi Papa miracle we first have a data cable USB to the micro SBS 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.150
 clear 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.879
 then we have the acute one here 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.469
 we'll see you here 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.519
 Anyway, he says for the charger so here we can just go 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.159
 connect the usb cable like that 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.409
 and then charge the device to the outlet if we do not charge it on the PC 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.279
 would like 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.059
 we have various acute deck 11 here 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.779
 and there we just have different colors green orange purple then they will 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:21.749
 Naturally 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.749
 the ship was on the Â«Gateway frame here headphones with 3 comma 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:30.150
 5 millimeter jack connection for these tires 80 mm boxe 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.170
 here you can also plug in your own headphones if it is the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.479
 Quality probably a lot better 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.849
 the other the possibilities of Martin to take 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.999
 In addition, use cleaning aid took the headphones and we have here 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:48.790
 of course manual also we get here a second of her 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.309
 Both Nico sd card included and I put it all a nice time 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.469
 Now I'm getting pretty full 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.469
 the battery cover is approved and the water and the battery cover 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.749
 Abt flat and then I have now the first opportunity the two 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.350
 Gigabyte Nico is putting the card in there I have to look 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.119
 she is on the side 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.859
 and he did not seem to be easy 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.409
 was us 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.150
 just like impressions 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.019
 so and then, therefore, above all we have here a thousand 170 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.830
 Billions stabbed well 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.169
 The promises, according to Motorola, a talk time of five hours and 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.629
 After 19 4 times 6 days is both times 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.460
 so finally a once 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.630
 Of course, I have to use the SIM card first 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.530
 how does she get on top of that and she just pushes her over here 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.999
 that's a bit of fumbling 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.949
 we were really pushing them 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.559
 under his informed 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.680
 in the sea it has to know what to look like that works 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.200
 once inserted the Hague on top of it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.629
 and the battery cover back there 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.879
 you can of course expand the storage capacity by adding a 32 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.210
 Bought Gigabyte Nico SDK 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.730
 besides, he took in six countries Niger processor what the fine performance 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:12.700
 brings 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.060
 the charming one more videos 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.210
 The device weighs 110 grams is small and practical and square fits in well 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.720
 the trouser pockets in the hand 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.090
 how the operation is look at the best in the two videos on www 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.010
 Andy - are they bund de the device costs around 160 euros is so relatively 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.260
 cheap from the price-performance ratio we have a smartphone here and even 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.940
 a very small disgraceful
