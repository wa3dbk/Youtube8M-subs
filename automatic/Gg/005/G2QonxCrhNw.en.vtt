00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.300 

during<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.849> 2011<00:03:20.780> earthquake<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.650> tsunami

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.789 
during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami
um<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.450> area<00:03:23.840> was<00:03:24.019> actually<00:03:24.170> really<00:03:24.590> close

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
um this area was actually really close

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.860 
um this area was actually really close
to<00:03:25.489> where<00:03:25.879> lots<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:26.420> damage<00:03:26.720> happened

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
to where lots of this damage happened

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.130 
to where lots of this damage happened
but<00:03:27.730> because<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.909> all<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.329> islands<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:29.870> it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
but because of all the islands here it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.490 
but because of all the islands here it
protected<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:30.980> area<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.780> six<00:03:32.780> people<00:03:32.959> were
