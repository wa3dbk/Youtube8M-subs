here<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.770> charger<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.180> might

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
here are in the charger now it might

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
here are in the charger now it might
look<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.780> same<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.770> actually<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.340> got<00:02:26.460> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
look the same but actually it's got a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.480 
look the same but actually it's got a
better<00:02:26.760> connection<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.990> now<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.920> RGB

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
better connection and you now have a RGB

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.430 
better connection and you now have a RGB
LED<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.450> let<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.840> when<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.170> charging

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
LED to let you know when it's charging

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
LED to let you know when it's charging
so<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.710> can<00:02:31.830> sort<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.580> status

so you can sort of see your status
otherwise<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> couldn't<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.780> on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
otherwise you couldn't really do it on

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.900 
otherwise you couldn't really do it on
the<00:02:33.990> previous<00:02:34.350> pebble<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.610> have

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the previous pebble you also have

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.700 
the previous pebble you also have
Gorilla<00:02:36.270> Glass<00:02:36.510> 2<00:02:36.780> years<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.440> much

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
Gorilla Glass 2 years so make it much

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.790 
Gorilla Glass 2 years so make it much
much<00:02:37.980> much<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.370> durable<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.990> screen<00:02:40.260> the
