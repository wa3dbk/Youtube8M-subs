an<00:01:08.990> outer<00:01:09.140> empath<00:01:09.650> basically<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:10.610> when<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
an outer empath basically is when the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.850 
an outer empath basically is when the
club<00:01:11.540> for<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.780> right-handed<00:01:12.290> golfer<00:01:12.350> is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
club for a right-handed golfer is

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.399 
club for a right-handed golfer is
swinging<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.610> little<00:01:13.790> bit<00:01:14.060> too<00:01:14.600> much<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:15.260> the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
swinging a little bit too much to the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.830 
swinging a little bit too much to the
left<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.100> normally<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> outer<00:01:17.360> wing<00:01:17.720> is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
left so normally the outer wing is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.420 
left so normally the outer wing is
referring<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.440> target<00:01:18.830> line<00:01:18.979> your<00:01:19.190> club

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
referring to the target line your club

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.429 
referring to the target line your club
is<00:01:19.460> from<00:01:19.790> sort<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.390> out<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:20.930> front<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
is from sort of out in front of the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.469 
is from sort of out in front of the
target<00:01:21.619> line<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:22.430> from<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.880> target<00:01:23.299> line

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
target line to in from the target line

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.040 
target line to in from the target line
and<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.229> generally<00:01:24.770> we<00:01:24.950> see<00:01:25.870> produces<00:01:26.870> that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
and this generally we see produces that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.200 
and this generally we see produces that
sort<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.890> slice<00:01:28.190> shot<00:01:28.490> there<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.090> is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
sort of that's slice shot there so it is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.510 
sort of that's slice shot there so it is
the<00:01:29.720> most<00:01:29.870> common<00:01:30.230> one<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:31.400> know<00:01:31.490> a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.160 
path between these two points and I
think<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.090> great<00:02:59.359> part<00:02:59.629> about<00:02:59.689> this<00:02:59.989> it's

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
think the great part about this it's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.959 
think the great part about this it's
forcing<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.829> do<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> movement<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.579> you

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
forcing you to do a movement and you

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.119 
forcing you to do a movement and you
know<00:03:02.090> what<00:03:02.349> when<00:03:03.349> there's<00:03:03.530> things<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:03.980> way

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
know what when there's things in the way

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.729 
know what when there's things in the way
it<00:03:04.999> does<00:03:05.180> it's<00:03:05.719> interesting<00:03:05.989> how<00:03:06.290> many<00:03:06.469> people

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
it does it's interesting how many people

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.199 
it does it's interesting how many people
change<00:03:06.980> faster<00:03:07.430> because<00:03:07.700> they<00:03:07.819> don't<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.150> to

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
change faster because they don't want to

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.699 
change faster because they don't want to
hit<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.389> it<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.139> very<00:03:09.319> interesting<00:03:09.530> you

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
hit this it is it's very interesting you

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.319 
hit this it is it's very interesting you
notice<00:03:09.889> because<00:03:10.189> at<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.760> end<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.150> day

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
notice because at the end of the day

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.539 
notice because at the end of the day
people<00:03:11.359> find<00:03:12.169> it<00:03:12.379> very<00:03:12.409> difficult<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:13.310> change

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
people find it very difficult to change

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.789 
people find it very difficult to change
so<00:03:14.389> if<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.629> just<00:03:14.810> stand<00:03:15.049> there<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.409> try<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
so if you just stand there and try to

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.979 
so if you just stand there and try to
get<00:03:16.129> your<00:03:16.250> path<00:03:16.579> more<00:03:16.939> out<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.419> the<00:03:17.510> right<00:03:17.689> so

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
get your path more out to the right so

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.830 
get your path more out to the right so
more<00:03:18.139> inside<00:03:18.680> out<00:03:18.889> in<00:03:19.159> two<00:03:19.280> hours<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:20.510> it's

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
more inside out in two hours it's it's

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.509 
more inside out in two hours it's it's
harder<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.799> unless<00:03:21.949> if<00:03:22.250> you've<00:03:22.370> got

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
harder to do it unless if you've got

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.920 
harder to do it unless if you've got
something<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:22.969> ground<00:03:23.269> there<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.659> really

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
something on the ground there it really

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.569 
something on the ground there it really
is<00:03:24.319> going<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.739> force<00:03:24.949> you<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:25.189> Andy's<00:03:25.430> gonna

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
is going to force you so Andy's gonna

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.770 
is going to force you so Andy's gonna
hit<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> shot<00:03:25.939> thinking<00:03:26.269> minute<00:03:26.449> I<00:03:26.480> wanna<00:03:26.659> do<00:03:26.750> a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
hit a shot thinking minute I wanna do a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.929 
hit a shot thinking minute I wanna do a
nice<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.500> say<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.189> the<00:03:28.250> first<00:03:28.459> thing<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.699> do<00:03:28.819> is

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
nice to say so the first thing to do is

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.099 
nice to say so the first thing to do is
before<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.239> actually<00:03:29.449> hit<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> golf<00:03:29.959> ball

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
before you actually hit a golf ball

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.289 
before you actually hit a golf ball
let's<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:30.949> a<00:03:30.980> few<00:03:31.400> practice<00:03:31.760> swings<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.090> see

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
let's have a few practice swings and see

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.360 
let's have a few practice swings and see
if<00:03:32.419> we<00:03:32.599> can<00:03:32.840> first<00:03:33.379> of<00:03:33.530> all<00:03:33.650> see<00:03:33.889> that<00:03:34.069> Club

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
if we can first of all see that Club

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.589 
if we can first of all see that Club
swinging<00:03:34.669> a<00:03:34.849> little<00:03:34.939> bit<00:03:35.150> more<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.449> the<00:03:35.569> right

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
swinging a little bit more to the right

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.539 
swinging a little bit more to the right
and<00:03:36.079> you'll<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:36.620> almost<00:03:36.949> little<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.519> a

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and you'll see almost little like a

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.580 
and you'll see almost little like a
little<00:03:37.849> blur<00:03:38.090> especially<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.079> nice<00:03:39.290> white

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
little blur especially this nice white

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.319 
little blur especially this nice white
driver<00:03:39.889> you'll<00:03:40.129> see<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.459> blur<00:03:40.729> of<00:03:40.909> that<00:03:41.060> Club

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
driver you'll see that blur of that Club

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.629 
driver you'll see that blur of that Club
swinging<00:03:42.049> between<00:03:42.259> the<00:03:42.560> two<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.489> you

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
swinging between the two and it's you

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.699 
swinging between the two and it's you
know<00:03:43.669> what<00:03:43.879> it's<00:03:44.479> so<00:03:44.689> easy<00:03:45.019> without<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.500> golf

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
know what it's so easy without the golf

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.170 
know what it's so easy without the golf
ball<00:03:45.919> where<00:03:46.099> but<00:03:46.609> it's<00:03:46.729> certainly<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.120> to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
ball where but it's certainly going to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.580 
ball where but it's certainly going to
create<00:03:47.419> a<00:03:47.449> different<00:03:47.750> feeling<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.139> what<00:03:48.409> you'd

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
create a different feeling to what you'd

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.749 
create a different feeling to what you'd
normally<00:03:48.739> do<00:03:49.009> if<00:03:49.220> you're<00:03:49.370> somebody<00:03:49.609> who

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:49.759 
normally do if you're somebody who

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.159 
normally do if you're somebody who
swings<00:03:49.970> out<00:03:50.180> doing<00:03:50.479> it's<00:03:50.780> interesting<00:03:50.989> just

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
swings out doing it's interesting just

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.509 
swings out doing it's interesting just
to<00:03:51.349> have<00:03:51.470> another<00:03:51.889> go<00:03:52.040> starting<00:03:52.280> with<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
to have another go starting with the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.159 
to have another go starting with the
practice<00:03:52.729> but<00:03:52.909> just<00:03:53.120> do<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.810> chip<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
practice but just do the the chip and

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.509 
practice but just do the the chip and
run<00:03:54.290> length<00:03:54.530> students<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:54.979> we<00:03:55.040> do<00:03:55.189> as<00:03:55.340> well

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
run length students that we do as well

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.280 
run length students that we do as well
so<00:03:55.699> actually<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.269> some<00:03:56.419> people<00:03:56.750> we<00:03:57.049> get<00:03:57.169> them

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
so actually with some people we get them

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.110 
so actually with some people we get them
to<00:03:57.379> do<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.620> with<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:57.859> chip<00:03:58.639> and<00:03:58.819> run<00:03:58.909> length

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
to do it with a chip and run length

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.580 
to do it with a chip and run length
swing<00:03:59.299> or<00:03:59.419> even<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.689> putt<00:03:59.900> length<00:04:00.109> swing<00:04:00.439> you

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
swing or even a putt length swing you

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.990 
swing or even a putt length swing you
know<00:04:00.709> even<00:04:01.159> if<00:04:01.220> we<00:04:01.280> would<00:04:01.400> just<00:04:01.519> take<00:04:01.669> the<00:04:01.790> clip

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
know even if we would just take the clip

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.819 
know even if we would just take the clip
back<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.299> my<00:04:02.419> hand<00:04:02.689> here<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.139> then<00:04:03.379> go<00:04:03.560> through

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
back to my hand here and then go through

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.699 
back to my hand here and then go through
just<00:04:04.310> learn<00:04:04.699> what<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.180> feels<00:04:05.509> like<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:06.500> get

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
just learn what it feels like to get

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.339 
just learn what it feels like to get
that<00:04:06.889> Club<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:08.000> out<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.689> the<00:04:08.780> right<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
that Club going out to the right so you

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.289 
that Club going out to the right so you
can<00:04:09.379> see<00:04:09.709> he<00:04:09.949> is<00:04:10.099> not<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.579> out<00:04:10.909> to<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.180> he's

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
can see he is not going out to and he's

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.490 
can see he is not going out to and he's
not<00:04:11.479> over<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.780> top<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.079> swing<00:04:12.259> plane

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
not over the top of the swing plane

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.800 
not over the top of the swing plane
he<00:04:12.949> is<00:04:13.159> getting<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.549> Club<00:04:13.879> path<00:04:14.120> out<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.689> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
he is getting that Club path out to the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.960 
he is getting that Club path out to the
right<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.259> if<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.439> can<00:04:15.620> practice<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.519> own

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
right and if you can practice that own

time you swing down over the top you're

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.860 
time you swing down over the top you're
taking<00:04:22.789> money<00:04:22.880> out<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.210> bank<00:04:23.389> every<00:04:23.509> time<00:04:23.750> you

out to the right so Andy's only thought

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.719 
out to the right so Andy's only thought

see if I can really get that Club
working<00:04:40.250> more<00:04:40.820> inside<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.419> more<00:04:41.570> out<00:04:41.719> to<00:04:41.870> the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
working more inside and more out to the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.390 
working more inside and more out to the
right<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:44.449> just<00:04:45.349> like<00:04:45.409> that<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.949> gets<00:04:46.099> a<00:04:46.250> nice

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
right and just like that it gets a nice

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.550 
right and just like that it gets a nice
little<00:04:46.430> draw<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.810> Gary<00:04:47.990> I'm<00:04:48.110> sure<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:48.440> would

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
little draw so Gary I'm sure you would

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
little draw so Gary I'm sure you would
love<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.979> if<00:04:49.070> we<00:04:49.219> can<00:04:49.400> get

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
love that if we can get

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.640 
love that if we can get
you<00:04:49.729> doing<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.449> then<00:04:51.169> it's<00:04:51.319> going<00:04:51.439> to<00:04:51.500> be

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
you doing that then it's going to be

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.040 
you doing that then it's going to be
very<00:04:51.830> much<00:04:51.949> a<00:04:52.009> more<00:04:53.000> enjoyable<00:04:53.300> game<00:04:53.659> for<00:04:53.930> you

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
very much a more enjoyable game for you

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.360 
very much a more enjoyable game for you
but<00:04:54.349> with<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.560> water<00:04:54.740> bottles<00:04:55.009> there

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
but with the water bottles there

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.100 
but with the water bottles there
mess<00:04:55.909> around<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.419> placements<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> little

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
mess around with the placements a little

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.600 
mess around with the placements a little
bit<00:04:57.199> you<00:04:57.319> can<00:04:57.500> make<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.919> tighter<00:04:58.159> so<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.460> can

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
bit you can make it tighter so you can

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.129 
bit you can make it tighter so you can
bring<00:04:58.819> it<00:04:58.969> in<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.120> little<00:04:59.330> bit<00:04:59.419> you<00:04:59.750> can<00:04:59.900> bring

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
bring it in a little bit you can bring

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.350 
bring it in a little bit you can bring
it<00:05:00.289> in<00:05:00.439> so<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.740> your<00:05:01.039> path<00:05:01.370> has<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.759> be<00:05:02.090> only

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it in so that your path has to be only

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.270 
it in so that your path has to be only
to<00:05:02.629> the<00:05:02.719> right<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.680> may<00:05:03.830> force<00:05:04.099> your

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
to the right so it may force your

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.010 
to the right so it may force your
backswing<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.789> go<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:04.939> little<00:05:05.210> bit<00:05:05.449> more<00:05:05.599> inside

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
backswing to go a little bit more inside

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.450 
backswing to go a little bit more inside
not<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> problem<00:05:06.889> if<00:05:07.069> we're<00:05:07.189> going<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.340> be

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
not a problem if we're going to be

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.189 
not a problem if we're going to be
working<00:05:07.819> really<00:05:08.030> hard<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.719> get<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:09.020> path

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
working really hard to get that path

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.390 
working really hard to get that path
back<00:05:09.349> to<00:05:09.379> the<00:05:09.500> right<00:05:09.650> it's<00:05:09.889> interesting<00:05:10.099> when

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
back to the right it's interesting when

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.800 
back to the right it's interesting when
we<00:05:10.490> use<00:05:10.669> this<00:05:10.789> with<00:05:11.000> some<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.240> our<00:05:11.330> students

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
we use this with some of our students

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.600 
we use this with some of our students
they<00:05:11.930> say<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.319> don't<00:05:12.469> know<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:12.949> bottles<00:05:13.490> are

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
they say I don't know the bottles are

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.629 
they say I don't know the bottles are
putting<00:05:13.939> me<00:05:14.060> off<00:05:14.090> that<00:05:14.979> support<00:05:15.979> you<00:05:16.069> up<00:05:16.219> okay

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
putting me off that support you up okay

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.550 
putting me off that support you up okay
that's<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.270> whole<00:05:17.449> purpose<00:05:17.719> of<00:05:17.960> this<00:05:18.169> it's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
that's the whole purpose of this it's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.200 
that's the whole purpose of this it's
gonna<00:05:18.860> create<00:05:19.159> a<00:05:19.310> different<00:05:19.699> feeling<00:05:20.060> and

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
gonna create a different feeling and

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.610 
gonna create a different feeling and
it's<00:05:20.539> gonna<00:05:20.629> force<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.110> create<00:05:21.379> a<00:05:21.439> better

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
it's gonna force you to create a better

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.469 
it's gonna force you to create a better
movement<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.460> if<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.639> can<00:05:22.789> do<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:23.060> hip<00:05:23.300> nice

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
movement and if you can do that hip nice

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.820 
movement and if you can do that hip nice
to<00:05:23.629> draw<00:05:23.900> like<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.139> I'm<00:05:24.440> sure<00:05:24.500> you're<00:05:24.710> gonna

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
to draw like that I'm sure you're gonna

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.959 
to draw like that I'm sure you're gonna
be<00:05:24.919> happy<00:05:25.159> and<00:05:25.370> getting<00:05:25.490> rid<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:25.789> slice

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
be happy and getting rid of that slice

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.700 
be happy and getting rid of that slice
absolutely<00:05:26.569> so<00:05:26.690> Gary<00:05:26.900> what<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.259> must<00:05:27.440> do<00:05:27.590> is

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
absolutely so Gary what you must do is

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.020 
absolutely so Gary what you must do is
you<00:05:27.740> must<00:05:27.860> put<00:05:28.159> the<00:05:28.250> bottles<00:05:28.520> of<00:05:28.610> water<00:05:28.789> down

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
you must put the bottles of water down

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.180 
you must put the bottles of water down
then<00:05:29.449> from<00:05:29.719> there<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:30.050> must<00:05:30.349> exaggerate<00:05:31.039> that

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
then from there you must exaggerate that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.189 
then from there you must exaggerate that
path<00:05:31.520> out<00:05:31.759> to<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.150> right<00:05:32.330> as<00:05:32.569> much<00:05:32.960> as

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
path out to the right as much as

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.050 
path out to the right as much as
possible<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:33.860> hopefully<00:05:34.460> eventually<00:05:34.639> you<00:05:34.909> can
