not revealed it's been a long time I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
not revealed it's been a long time I
mean<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.019> last<00:00:28.199> thing<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> saw<00:00:28.920> that

mean the last thing I think I saw that
was<00:00:29.250> something<00:00:29.519> similar<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.510> terms

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
was something similar to this in terms

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
was something similar to this in terms
of<00:00:31.619> anime<00:00:32.160> wise<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:35.600> really<00:00:36.600> don't

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
of anime wise I think I really don't

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
of anime wise I think I really don't
know<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> extent<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.700> not

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
know but like not to this extent I not

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
know but like not to this extent I not
to<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.540> specific<00:00:40.200> extent<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:41.090> craziness

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to this specific extent with craziness

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
to this specific extent with craziness
like<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> series<00:00:44.129> gurashi

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
like this series gurashi

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.660 
like this series gurashi
is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.480> series<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.039> majority<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> us

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
is a series that I think majority of us

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
is a series that I think majority of us
can<00:00:47.850> save<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
can save we really don't know what to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.900 
can save we really don't know what to
expect

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
expect

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510 
expect
and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.629> want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> say<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.590> real<00:00:52.920> quick<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and I want to say something real quick I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
and I want to say something real quick I
took<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.020> manga<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.890> heard

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
took a look at the manga because I heard

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.790 
took a look at the manga because I heard
there's<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.340> 35<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.910> 36<00:00:57.270> chapters<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there's like 35 or 36 chapters of this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950 
there's like 35 or 36 chapters of this
series<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> decided<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> glance<00:01:00.780> at

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
series so I decided to take a glance at

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.689 
series so I decided to take a glance at
the<00:01:01.050> longest<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> looked<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.399> six

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the longest so I looked at the first six

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.320 
the longest so I looked at the first six
chapters<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.439> series<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.519> how

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
chapters of this series just to see how

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
chapters of this series just to see how
it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.979> already<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it is and from what I can already see is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.500 
it is and from what I can already see is
the<00:01:09.780> main<00:01:09.960> premise<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.189> manga<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the main premise of the manga is in this

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.690 
the main premise of the manga is in this
series<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> entire<00:01:13.920> events<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.520> being

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
series but the entire events are being

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
series but the entire events are being
shuffled<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
shuffled around from what I can see and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
shuffled around from what I can see and
stuff<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.610> didn't<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.240> happen<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
stuff that I didn't see happen is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190 
stuff that I didn't see happen is
already<00:01:19.350> happening<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.210> seems<00:01:21.750> like

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
already happening and so it seems like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
already happening and so it seems like
we're<00:01:22.799> getting<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.400> anime<00:01:23.850> original

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we're getting like an anime original

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
we're getting like an anime original
adapt<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.340> Shinto<00:01:26.390> dog<00:01:27.470> does<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.680> even<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
adapt a Shinto dog does not even in the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
adapt a Shinto dog does not even in the
manga<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> saw<00:01:30.119> from<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> light<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
manga from what I saw from the light the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
manga from what I saw from the light the
first<00:01:31.049> six<00:01:31.259> chapters<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.890> read<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.850> dog<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
first six chapters I read the my dog is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.219 
first six chapters I read the my dog is
not<00:01:33.840> even<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.920> manga<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> shock

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
not even in the manga but from the shock

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
not even in the manga but from the shock
factor<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.950> last<00:01:38.340> week's<00:01:38.700> episode<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.420> all

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
factor of last week's episode and all

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.789 
factor of last week's episode and all
that<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.259> better<00:01:40.409> than<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that it was a lot better than the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.730 
that it was a lot better than the
longest<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.119> no<00:01:42.240> idea<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
longest so I have no idea but but what I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
longest so I have no idea but but what I
see<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> seems<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> series<00:01:45.299> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
see is it seems like the series is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
see is it seems like the series is
taking<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.869> anime<00:01:46.290> original<00:01:46.829> route<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
taking an anime original route but that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
taking an anime original route but that
like<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.820> said<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.180> does<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.509> make<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.720> fat

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like I said that does not make it fat

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
percent no way once again like that's

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.130 
percent no way once again like that's
where<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.060> fought<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.479> episode<00:05:48.840> was<00:05:48.930> going<00:05:49.080> to
