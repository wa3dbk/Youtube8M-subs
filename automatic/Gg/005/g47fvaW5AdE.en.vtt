bikes the SB 75 this is their entrance
into<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.560> 275<00:00:19.159> market<00:00:19.970> as<00:00:20.119> well<00:00:20.390> as<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.779> arc

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
into the 275 market as well as the arc

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.929 
into the 275 market as well as the arc

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
that they have coming out this year so

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.589 
that they have coming out this year so
Peter<00:00:23.630> tell<00:00:24.109> me<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.259> bit<00:00:24.829> about<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:26.060> bike<00:00:26.329> and

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
Peter tell me a bit about this bike and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.749 
Peter tell me a bit about this bike and
what<00:00:26.749> makes<00:00:27.380> it<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:27.710> awesome<00:00:27.739> sure<00:00:28.519> well<00:00:28.669> this

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
what makes it so awesome sure well this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.999 
what makes it so awesome sure well this
is<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.909> like<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.300> said<00:00:29.449> this<00:00:29.569> is<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.749> new<00:00:30.079> SB<00:00:30.439> 75

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
is a like you said this is the new SB 75

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.069 
is a like you said this is the new SB 75
available<00:00:31.640> for<00:00:31.819> actually<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:32.570> in<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.930> next

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
available for actually here in the next

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.979 
available for actually here in the next
month<00:00:33.519> something<00:00:34.519> like<00:00:35.210> all<00:00:35.359> other<00:00:35.510> SP<00:00:35.809> bikes

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
month something like all other SP bikes

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.450 
month something like all other SP bikes
we<00:00:36.199> use<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.469> same<00:00:36.680> naming<00:00:36.980> convention

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
we use the same naming convention

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.750 
we use the same naming convention
roughly<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.059> on<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.440> first<00:00:39.679> number<00:00:40.399> here

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
roughly so on the the first number here

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.759 
roughly so on the the first number here
on<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.030> SP<00:00:41.420> 75<00:00:41.780> stands<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.410> wheel<00:00:42.530> size

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
on the SP 75 stands for the wheel size

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.340 
on the SP 75 stands for the wheel size
so<00:00:43.100> 20<00:00:43.429> 7.5<00:00:43.969> inch<00:00:44.149> wheel<00:00:44.329> second<00:00:45.170> number

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
so 20 7.5 inch wheel second number

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.229 
so 20 7.5 inch wheel second number
standing<00:00:46.039> for<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.190> amount<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.429> travel<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.000> 5

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
standing for the amount of travel so 5

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.840 
standing for the amount of travel so 5
inches<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.629> travel<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:49.160> bike<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.640> all<00:00:49.789> of

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
inches of travel this bike like all of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.660 
inches of travel this bike like all of
our<00:00:49.910> other<00:00:49.969> SP<00:00:50.359> SP<00:00:50.719> bikes<00:00:51.170> uses<00:00:51.559> our<00:00:51.710> switch

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
our other SP SP bikes uses our switch

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.880 
our other SP SP bikes uses our switch
technology<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.600> with<00:00:54.109> that<00:00:54.199> technology<00:00:54.589> we

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
technology so with that technology we

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.610 
technology so with that technology we
use<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.129> eccentric<00:00:56.059> down<00:00:56.269> here<00:00:56.539> for<00:00:56.960> our<00:00:57.140> lower

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
use a eccentric down here for our lower

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.069 
use a eccentric down here for our lower
link<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.160> using<00:00:59.120> eccentric<00:00:59.570> in<00:00:59.749> this<00:00:59.870> link

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
link and using eccentric in this link

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.509 
link and using eccentric in this link
system<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.499> allows<00:01:00.649> us<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.949> really<00:01:01.070> finely

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
system it allows us to really finely

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.819 
system it allows us to really finely
tuned<00:01:01.730> are<00:01:01.999> our<00:01:02.749> chain<00:01:03.050> growth<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> system

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
tuned are our chain growth in the system

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.980 
tuned are our chain growth in the system
and<00:01:04.519> what<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:04.909> does<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.210> allows<00:01:05.480> us<00:01:05.660> to

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
and what that does is allows us to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.780 
and what that does is allows us to
create<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.290> system<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.710> pedals<00:01:07.580> really

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
create a system that pedals really

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.370 
create a system that pedals really
efficiently<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.360> beginning<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:08.960> then

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
efficiently in the beginning but then

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.750 
efficiently in the beginning but then
later<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.920> travel<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.340> pedaling

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
later on in the travel that pedaling

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.850 
later on in the travel that pedaling
efficiency<00:01:10.880> drops<00:01:11.330> away<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.290> allows<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.710> to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
efficiency drops away and allows you to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.380 
efficiency drops away and allows you to
we<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> really<00:01:13.250> plush<00:01:13.520> travel<00:01:13.970> when

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
we have a really plush travel when

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.520 
we have a really plush travel when
you're<00:01:14.510> descending<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.140> it's<00:01:15.260> really<00:01:15.440> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
you're descending so it's really the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.860 
you're descending so it's really the
best<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.890> both<00:01:16.220> worlds<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.000> eccentric

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
best of both worlds so this eccentric

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.260 
best of both worlds so this eccentric
will<00:01:18.050> actually<00:01:18.350> rotate<00:01:18.860> counterclockwise

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
will actually rotate counterclockwise

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.520 
will actually rotate counterclockwise
initially<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.390> travel<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.290> begin

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
initially in the travel and then begin

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.230 
initially in the travel and then begin
the<00:01:21.620> road<00:01:21.770> rotate<00:01:22.340> forward<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:22.880> travel

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
the road rotate forward and then travel

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.110 
the road rotate forward and then travel
very<00:01:24.110> cool<00:01:24.350> was<00:01:24.650> there<00:01:24.890> any<00:01:25.310> challenge<00:01:25.940> in

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
very cool was there any challenge in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.670 
very cool was there any challenge in
bringing<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.570> switch<00:01:26.780> technology<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
bringing the switch technology to the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.000 
bringing the switch technology to the
275<00:01:28.190> market<00:01:28.940> or<00:01:29.150> was<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:30.050> pretty<00:01:30.830> easy

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
275 market or was it just pretty easy

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.590 
275 market or was it just pretty easy
step<00:01:31.340> over<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.940> know<00:01:32.000> in<00:01:32.240> terms<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.510> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
step over you know in terms of the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000 
step over you know in terms of the
linkage<00:01:32.930> design<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.500> very<00:01:33.830> flexible

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
linkage design it's a very flexible

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.500 
linkage design it's a very flexible
design<00:01:34.370> for<00:01:34.700> us<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:34.910> we're<00:01:35.030> able<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.330> change

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
design for us so we're able to change

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.420 
design for us so we're able to change
real<00:01:35.750> size<00:01:35.990> change<00:01:36.350> travel<00:01:36.740> really<00:01:37.040> easily<00:01:37.310> so

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
real size change travel really easily so

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.460 
real size change travel really easily so
the<00:01:38.150> actual<00:01:38.270> kinematics<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.020> vice<00:01:39.170> was

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
the actual kinematics that the vice was

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.170 
the actual kinematics that the vice was
was<00:01:39.770> fairly<00:01:39.980> simple<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.520> straightforward<00:01:40.700> we

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
was fairly simple and straightforward we

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.030 
was fairly simple and straightforward we
did<00:01:41.330> several<00:01:41.810> iterations<00:01:42.050> kind<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.800> in-house

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
did several iterations kind of in-house

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.130 
did several iterations kind of in-house
as<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.370> always<00:01:43.550> do<00:01:43.820> we<00:01:44.600> have<00:01:44.690> a<00:01:44.750> lot<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.900> people

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
as we always do we have a lot of people

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.110 
as we always do we have a lot of people
that<00:01:45.500> ride<00:01:45.740> x-pro<00:01:46.310> riders<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> lot<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.910> people

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
that ride x-pro riders a lot of people

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.550 
that ride x-pro riders a lot of people
that<00:01:47.600> are<00:01:47.690> really<00:01:47.840> interacting<00:01:48.200> obviously

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that are really interacting obviously

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.800 
that are really interacting obviously
Yeti<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.370> we've<00:01:49.640> got<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.790> lot<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.300> lot<00:01:50.510> of<00:01:50.630> time

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
Yeti so we've got a lot of a lot of time

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
Yeti so we've got a lot of a lot of time
actually<00:01:51.320> testing<00:01:51.860> mules<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.670> prototypes

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
actually testing mules and prototypes

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.700 
actually testing mules and prototypes
before<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.480> head<00:01:53.690> before<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.290> actual

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
before this head before this actual

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.290 
before this head before this actual
production<00:01:54.860> bike<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.940> actual

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
production bike but the actual

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.030 
production bike but the actual
switchover<00:01:56.900> was<00:01:57.110> fairly<00:01:57.500> straightforward

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
switchover was fairly straightforward

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480 
switchover was fairly straightforward
very<00:01:59.370> cool<00:02:00.380> now<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.440> have<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> whole<00:02:02.100> bunch<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
very cool now we have a whole bunch of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.300 
very cool now we have a whole bunch of
cool<00:02:03.330> bikes<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:04.200> Yeti<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:05.010> know<00:02:05.130> we've

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
cool bikes here from Yeti you know we've

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.020 
cool bikes here from Yeti you know we've
had<00:02:05.340> things<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.970> 57<00:02:06.750> 5s<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> 66<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> 29

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
had things like 57 5s and 66 and the 29

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.010 
had things like 57 5s and 66 and the 29
errs<00:02:09.380> now<00:02:10.380> why<00:02:10.590> would<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.580> 275<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.690> kind<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
errs now why would the 275 be kind of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.300 
errs now why would the 275 be kind of
the<00:02:13.080> bike<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.410> choose<00:02:13.650> over<00:02:13.980> some<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> those

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the bike to choose over some of those

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.150 
the bike to choose over some of those
other<00:02:14.490> options<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.480> think<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.810> 75<00:02:16.800> or

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
other options you know I think the 75 or

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
other options you know I think the 75 or
27<00:02:17.640> 5<00:02:17.760> inch<00:02:17.970> wheel<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.390> uh<00:02:18.420> people<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.200> really

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
27 5 inch wheel is uh people are really

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
27 5 inch wheel is uh people are really
excited<00:02:19.530> about<00:02:19.710> right<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.610> right

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
excited about right now it's a right

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
excited about right now it's a right
there<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.390> middle<00:02:21.540> between<00:02:21.720> 26<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.380> 29

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
there in the middle between 26 and 29

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.520 
there in the middle between 26 and 29
roughly<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.750> general<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.440> just

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
roughly and in general I think it just

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
roughly and in general I think it just
is<00:02:25.890> opens<00:02:26.430> door<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:26.640> more<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.420> options<00:02:27.780> for

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
is opens door for more more options for

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
is opens door for more more options for
people<00:02:27.990> i<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.680> I've<00:02:28.860> kind<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.160> mentioned

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
people i think as I've kind of mentioned

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.950 
people i think as I've kind of mentioned
some<00:02:29.880> maybe<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.150> other<00:02:30.240> interviews<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.870> in

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
some maybe some other interviews and in

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.630 
some maybe some other interviews and in
terms<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.230> wheel<00:02:31.380> size<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.830> comes<00:02:32.040> down<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.459> lot

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
terms of wheel size it comes down a lot

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
terms of wheel size it comes down a lot
to<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.090> preference<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> comes<00:02:33.840> down<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.170> where

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to the preference it comes down to where

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.530 
to the preference it comes down to where
you're<00:02:34.620> riding<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.550> trade<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.480> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you're riding what your trade is so it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.670 
you're riding what your trade is so it
just<00:02:36.690> gives<00:02:36.750> another<00:02:36.990> option<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> somebody

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
just gives another option to somebody

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.870 
just gives another option to somebody
out<00:02:37.770> there<00:02:37.920> that's<00:02:37.950> interested<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
out there that's interested in that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.340 
out there that's interested in that
wheel<00:02:39.060> size<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.050> lot<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.260> people

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
wheel size and I think a lot of people

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160 
wheel size and I think a lot of people
are<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.730> time<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.300> everybody<00:02:43.050> out
