00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.760
It's nice, right?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.082
When you look at the A-Class,
you can notice what went wrong with the 1 Serie...

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:14.047
...and why the A3 is so intense dull.

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:16.181
Because what a good looking car is this!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.332
The A-Class is released in many configurations,
but the most interesting one is the A250.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:29.213
At least, for us it is.
You, as lease drivers, will all order the A180 BlueEfficiency.

00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:34.926
The A250 is the thickest model, with 211 hp.
Which is something like Golf GTI power.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.992
You can forget the old A-Class,
where your grandparents are driving in.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.117
Those people have to move to the B-Class,

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:47.319
because the A-Class becomes the competition
of the 1 Serie, A3 and Volvo V40.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.548
This car is designed to attract
new and young public to Mercedes.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.754
Today we are driving the A250,
which is the fastest gasoline edition released in first instance.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:01.821
This car is pretty racy, but also quite lazy.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:08.110
For example, the automatic gearbox isn't shifting very fast,
and manual shifting also doesn't make me very happy.

00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:12.340
On the other hand, there is enough power available,
and it's pretty fast.

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:17.241
But then there's the chassis,
which is not very comfortable.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.460
It has big wheels which makes it a bit bumpy,
but it's not..

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:23.705
Well, I find this a very difficult car.

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:29.253
There also another edition with this chassis and power,
which makes it a bit complicated.

00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:35.516
This is the A250 BlueEfficiency,
with an AMG sport package.

00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:39.963
But this is not the A250 Sport AMG.

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:51.319
I really don't get it, why is there an A250 with 211 hp,
and an A250 Sport with 211 hp.

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:58.386
Let's do some rounds around the circuit,
to see if the AMG Sport edition is faster.

00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:04.732
This feels so much more aggressive.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.045
Really amazing, it feels like an entirely different car.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:15.374
AMG did some development on the front axis,
and you notice that it steers really tight.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:29.267
The sound of the A250 AMG Sport is also much better
than the weak and powerless sound of the regular A250.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.025
Oops, we missed a traffic cone because
I was getting a bit too enthusiastic...

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.038
...in trying to keep up with the professional driver.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.860
This while I have the talent of a wet newspaper.

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.601
So, Mercedes wants to attract young public with the A-Class.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.714
And this means: iPhones.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.222
How else can it be?

00:02:53.223 --> 00:03:02.741
So on the dashboard is some kind of mini iPad/maxi iPhone,
in which you really see the styling of the iPhone screens.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:08.408
This really looks like what we see at Apple.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:19.302
So your iPhone is completely integrated,
you can check your Facebook and use Siri (in the near future).

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:23.306
You can also check your Twitter,
and do so many other things.

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:29.637
The A-Class starts at 28.995 euro for the A180 BlueEfficiency.

00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:34.825
But, this includes some options that you
have to check on your order list at BMW or Audi.

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:39.082
For example, in the A-Class, navigation is standard.
Which may not be the case at Audi or BMW.

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:45.050
A Collision Protect System is also included,
which helps you to brake if necessary.

00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:47.080
So thing like that are standard included in the A-Class.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:53.090
Fact is though, that Audi and BMW give you
the choice to order a less expensive edition.

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:58.771
When you want to do that at Mercedes,
you start 3000 euro higher.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:04.995
Yesterday I took the effort to fill in
my configurator at Mercedes.nl.

00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:10.697
I think that the car we're driving today
costs about 60.000 euro in the Netherlands,

00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:13.349
while the standard A250
starts a little above 40.000 euro.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.999
This car is filled with so many options.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.654
I expect that, if you try hard enough,
and let me know in the comments...

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:25.501
...but it won't surprise me 
if you can drive an A-Class of 70.000 euro.

00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:31.504
And that's a lot of money 
for a car the seize of a Volkswagen Golf.

00:04:32.214 --> 00:04:33.364
Right?

00:04:36.045 --> 00:04:38.672
If you decide to order an A-Class, 

00:04:38.673 --> 00:04:43.223
then I wish you a lot of success 
with the enormous amount of editions they offer.

00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:46.562
Let's say that it's quite complicated.

00:04:46.563 --> 00:04:54.750
Anyway, there's an Urban line, Sports Line
and an uh.. Elegance Line, I think.

00:04:54.751 --> 00:05:01.971
Then there are the AMG packages, AMG Exclusive packages
and other packages.

00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:18.875
And there's the A250 Sport with standard an AMG package,
but I'm not sure which one.

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:21.681
But you can pick packages, yay!
