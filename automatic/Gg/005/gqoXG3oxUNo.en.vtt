hey everyone this is my Wurlitzer 206a

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey everyone this is my Wurlitzer 206a
it's<00:00:03.750> like<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.259> 200<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.040> except<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.060> year<00:00:06.540> which

it's like a 200 a except this year which

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.680 
it's like a 200 a except this year which
is<00:00:06.779> what<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> 200<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.040> would-be<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.610> attached<00:00:09.389> to

is what a 200 a would-be is attached to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.120 
is what a 200 a would-be is attached to
this<00:00:09.840> base<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.700> as<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.210> see<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.130> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
this base here as you can see and the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.519 
this base here as you can see and the
speakers<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.910> over<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> 208<00:00:16.320> are

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
speakers that are over here at a 208 are

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
speakers that are over here at a 208 are
in<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> base<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.789> larger<00:00:18.270> which<00:00:18.420> gives<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
in the base and larger which gives it a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.040 
in the base and larger which gives it a
much<00:00:18.960> more<00:00:19.199> powerful<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.100> barky<00:00:21.090> growly<00:00:21.660> kind

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
much more powerful and barky growly kind

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
much more powerful and barky growly kind
of<00:00:22.170> tone<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:23.220> makes<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> sound<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> lot

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
of tone which makes it sound a lot

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.990 
of tone which makes it sound a lot
better<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.359> recordings<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.410> anything<00:00:26.000> like

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
better for recordings for anything like

00:00:27.000 --> 00:01:34.230 
better for recordings for anything like
that<00:00:27.060> here's<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> sounds<00:00:28.019> like

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.389 

so<00:01:35.240> as<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.569> can<00:01:35.689> see<00:01:35.929> it<00:01:36.079> sounds<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:37.220> as<00:01:37.340> good

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
so as you can see it sounds just as good

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.740 
so as you can see it sounds just as good
if<00:01:37.549> not<00:01:37.670> better<00:01:37.850> as<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.299> 200<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:40.270> just<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.420> few

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
look a lot more like a 208 and the base

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.399 
look a lot more like a 208 and the base
is<00:01:48.649> painted<00:01:48.950> black<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.170> everything<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.259> here

is<00:01:51.439> working<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.159> electronics<00:01:52.759> work

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
is working all the electronics work

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:03.310 
is working all the electronics work
here's<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.599> volume<00:01:53.959> knob<00:01:56.950> sustain<00:01:57.950> pedal

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.200 

and<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.770> action<00:02:05.160> for<00:02:05.310> all<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.670> keys<00:02:05.910> works

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and the action for all the keys works

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.010 
and the action for all the keys works
just<00:02:06.510> fine<00:02:07.820> except<00:02:08.820> for<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.240> here<00:02:09.810> this

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
just fine except for this one here this

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.510 
just fine except for this one here this
is<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:11.100> octaves<00:02:11.520> above<00:02:11.640> middle<00:02:12.060> C<00:02:13.520> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
is be two octaves above middle C it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880 
is be two octaves above middle C it
rings<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.020> simple<00:02:16.320> adjustment<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
rings and it's a simple adjustment to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
rings and it's a simple adjustment to
make<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:17.730> basically<00:02:17.880> go<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.360> there<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
make you just basically go in there and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
make you just basically go in there and
you<00:02:18.720> tighten<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> screw<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.620> don't<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:20.670> time

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you tighten the screw I don't have time

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
you tighten the screw I don't have time
to<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.959> my<00:02:22.290> loss<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.530> your<00:02:22.800> game

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to do it now and so my loss is your game

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
to do it now and so my loss is your game
but<00:02:24.030> other<00:02:24.240> than<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.450> key<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.260> rest<00:02:25.470> all

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
but other than that key the rest all

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
but other than that key the rest all
work<00:02:25.800> fine

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.290 

that's<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:40.310> more<00:02:40.490> thing<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.030> over

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
that's it one more thing is that over

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300 
that's it one more thing is that over
here<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.720> left<00:02:41.930> side<00:02:42.140> underneath<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
here on the left side underneath the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.810 
here on the left side underneath the
keyboard<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.350> headphone<00:02:45.350> out<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:46.700> was

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
keyboard a headphone out that was

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.130 
keyboard a headphone out that was
previously<00:02:47.090> there<00:02:47.390> has<00:02:47.570> been<00:02:47.780> modified

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
previously there has been modified

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.930 
previously there has been modified
summated<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.400> works<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
summated so that it works with the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.170 
summated so that it works with the
standard<00:02:50.300> guitar<00:02:50.450> ampere<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.640> basically<00:02:53.060> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
standard guitar ampere it's basically a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630 
standard guitar ampere it's basically a
lie<00:02:53.420> down<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.960> plug<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.320> straight<00:02:54.650> into<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
lie down you can plug it straight into a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.970 
lie down you can plug it straight into a
home<00:02:56.270> recording<00:02:56.750> console<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:57.320> anything<00:02:57.950> like

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
home recording console or anything like
