lines of forty percent improvement which

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.010 
lines of forty percent improvement which
is<00:02:35.640> rather<00:02:35.790> awesome<00:02:36.030> considering<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.930> how

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
is rather awesome considering just how

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
about the patch is that the screen shake
