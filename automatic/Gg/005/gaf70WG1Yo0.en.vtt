00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.220
 hi friends 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.420
 I hope they are well and nice to greet you 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.320
 at this moment we are 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.350
 putting these foil patches as 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.180
 come we put some points here 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.930
 from this side down 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 asm 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.090
 in these parts down here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.090
 we made some holes with the toilet 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.620
 is a hole to discover a sheet 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 and leave it behind 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.110
 to do with a point nothing more than 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 welding a point we also did the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.649
 downstairs 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.240
 let's see if we can appreciate 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.240
 that part of here 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.730
 here we made some points 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.860
 from here this and this 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.970
 they are all points for welding 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.020
 not to make a cord 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.900
 we did original type 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.640
 to this part here below 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.890
 is where it falls 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.180
 all the water part until the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.600
 windshield all part of the water and it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.420
 it's coming down here and it has to come out 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.850
 about this building look 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.009
 here there is a hole are fixed it has already 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.009
 done this 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.470
 in 86 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 we can not paint I do not know what we can 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.870
 cast here you can be you and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.330
 to this we apply it inside 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.520
 so that it does not continue to apply because 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.730
 all this part was rotten 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.250
 that part 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.280
 no good 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 so we had to remove it in this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.410
 part of here we find a lot of mud 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 a lot of land because it started to get covered 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.330
 this hole and it began to fill and by 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.070
 that started to rot 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.450
 so then this is what we have 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.450
 until now at the moment 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.700
 Greetings to all my followers and 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.580
 ask for an apology because I could not 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.819
 uploading videos has consumed me a lot 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.700
 weather 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.760
 and I have not had this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.360
 time to upload videos to edit them and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 I could not see but 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.660
 but I do not know do not despair I have 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.240
 some things that I have to edit but 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.940
 I can not do it but 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.630
 then do not despair to follow 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.300
 watching my videos but at this moment 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.430
 I'm going to upload this video so that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.060
 something that serves them because this is already 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.690
 already specially laminated to graft 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.100
 to remove to put a sheet 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.370
 we see that I cut him here 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.840
 we made a template 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.190
 with a 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.190
 with a this cardboard 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.830
 but we did not do this template 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.830
 they fix here is this 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.550
 and we turned it 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.490
 and this was the template we based 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.770
 about this to make this piece 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.880
 the piece that was down here was this 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.640
 look 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 It's all chopped 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.770
 these dams 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 It does not take late, it does not take a few years and 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.250
 no good so we decided to change it 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.770
 so that you have 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.130

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.260
