00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
in that with the thickness of the boxes

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
in that with the thickness of the boxes
-<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.789> yeah<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
- I don't know if we can see this yeah I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140 
- I don't know if we can see this yeah I
do<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:29.460> also<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:30.000> bit

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
do like that it's also a little bit

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.959 
do like that it's also a little bit
thinner<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.920> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.070> Mac<00:00:32.369> did<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> pretty<00:00:32.790> good

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
thinner so I think Mac did a pretty good

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.440 
thinner so I think Mac did a pretty good
job<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.719> Apple<00:00:33.989> did<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> pretty<00:00:34.350> good<00:00:34.530> job<00:00:34.590> with

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
job and Apple did a pretty good job with

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
job and Apple did a pretty good job with
reducing<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> size<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.110> their<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:38.730> their

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
reducing the size of their of their

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.889 
reducing the size of their of their

shine a little flashlight there and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.750 
shine a little flashlight there and
it'll<00:02:57.380> go<00:02:57.650> off<00:02:57.829> but<00:02:58.160> it'll<00:02:58.430> come<00:02:58.579> back<00:02:58.610> on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
it'll go off but it'll come back on

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.180 
it'll go off but it'll come back on
because<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.540> ring<00:03:00.049> apparently<00:03:00.829> is<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.040> well

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
camera work I'm trying to do two things

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.250 
camera work I'm trying to do two things
at<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.280> same<00:04:39.659> time<00:04:41.159> and<00:04:42.630> centimeters<00:04:43.630> that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
at the same time and centimeters that

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.939 
at the same time and centimeters that
looks<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.070> be<00:04:45.250> about<00:04:45.400> seven<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.120> half<00:04:46.949> depth

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
looks to be about seven and a half depth

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:56.100 
looks to be about seven and a half depth
and<00:04:49.409> diagonally<00:04:52.050> about<00:04:53.050> 13<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:54.930> don't<00:04:55.930> think

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
and diagonally about 13 I don't think

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.629 
and diagonally about 13 I don't think
we're<00:04:56.680> getting<00:04:56.830> good<00:04:57.220> focus<00:04:57.820> here<00:04:58.060> try<00:04:58.659> this

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
we're getting good focus here try this

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.310 
we're getting good focus here try this
on<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.909> MacBook<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.659> old<00:05:01.780> MacBook

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
on the MacBook the old MacBook

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.950 
on the MacBook the old MacBook
let's<00:05:03.070> see<00:05:03.250> diagonally<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.330> would<00:05:04.509> be<00:05:04.659> about

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
let's see diagonally that would be about

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.630 
let's see diagonally that would be about
ten<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.650> half<00:05:06.930> across

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.770 

centimetres<00:05:13.640> that<00:05:13.850> is<00:05:14.050> five<00:05:15.050> centimeters

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
centimetres that is five centimeters

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.250 
centimetres that is five centimeters
depth<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:20.300> width<00:05:20.510> is<00:05:20.780> about<00:05:21.080> ten<00:05:23.260> with

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
depth and the width is about ten with

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.550 
depth and the width is about ten with
this<00:05:24.470> about<00:05:24.710> ten<00:05:24.980> did<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.250> get<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:26.560> that

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
this about ten did I get that and that

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.180 
this about ten did I get that and that
is<00:05:27.800> in<00:05:28.100> inches<00:05:29.290> that's<00:05:30.290> about<00:05:30.590> four<00:05:30.890> inches

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
is in inches that's about four inches

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.860 
is in inches that's about four inches
across<00:05:33.460> four<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:36.010> 1/4<00:05:37.010> inches<00:05:37.870> diagonally

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
across four and 1/4 inches diagonally

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.440 
across four and 1/4 inches diagonally
and<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:42.520> little<00:05:43.520> less<00:05:43.700> than<00:05:44.320> two<00:05:45.320> inches<00:05:45.710> deep

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
and a little less than two inches deep

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.600 
and a little less than two inches deep
so<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:47.510> see<00:05:47.720> there<00:05:47.900> is<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.220> pretty<00:05:49.220> substantial

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
so you see there is a pretty substantial

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.630 
so you see there is a pretty substantial
difference<00:05:50.510> between<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:50.900> trackpads<00:05:51.500> in<00:05:51.770> size

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
difference between the trackpads in size

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.480 
difference between the trackpads in size
not<00:05:53.450> just<00:05:53.810> missing<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.350> button<00:05:54.680> but<00:05:54.920> you<00:05:55.190> get

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
not just missing the button but you get

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.070 
not just missing the button but you get
a<00:05:55.520> lot<00:05:55.730> more<00:05:55.760> area<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.740> that's<00:05:58.750> that's<00:05:59.750> really

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
a lot more area and that's that's really

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.440 
a lot more area and that's that's really
it<00:06:00.260> I<00:06:00.920> wish<00:06:01.850> I<00:06:02.120> could<00:06:02.330> show<00:06:02.630> you<00:06:02.660> the

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
it I wish I could show you the

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.540 
it I wish I could show you the
difference<00:06:05.450> in<00:06:05.750> speed<00:06:06.020> of<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:06.980> operating
