00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Brian would do it you had a tank that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.880 
Brian would do it you had a tank that
was<00:01:33.509> only<00:01:33.810> anubius<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.380> quite<00:01:34.530> long<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
was only anubius for quite long do you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.020 
was only anubius for quite long do you
still<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.400> new<00:01:35.610> via<00:01:35.759> serviette

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
still have that all new via serviette

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.130 
still have that all new via serviette
other<00:01:36.299> species<00:01:36.630> there's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> few<00:01:36.990> other

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
other species there's a few other

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
other species there's a few other
species<00:01:37.350> alright<00:01:37.890> alright<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.220> yeah<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
species alright alright but yeah for the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.200 
species alright alright but yeah for the
most<00:01:38.970> part<00:01:39.270> pretty<00:01:40.110> much<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.180> mean

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
most part pretty much like just I mean

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.440 
most part pretty much like just I mean
anubius<00:01:42.920> propagating<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.369> old<00:01:44.700> 125<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
anubius propagating it the old 125 I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240 
anubius propagating it the old 125 I
have<00:01:45.780> inside<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.470> took<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.189> my

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have inside we actually took all my

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.639 
have inside we actually took all my
existing<00:01:48.000> anubius<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> spread<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.439> one

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
existing anubius and spread it out one

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.139 
existing anubius and spread it out one
time<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> how<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.369> did<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
time and this is how we did it here so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.179 
time and this is how we did it here so
I'll<00:01:51.720> walk<00:01:52.229> us<00:01:52.380> through<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.590> bra<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
I'll walk us through a bra you got the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.190 
I'll walk us through a bra you got the
main<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.670> find<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> main<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> artery<00:01:55.049> of

main you find the main kind of artery of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.389 
main you find the main kind of artery of
your<00:01:55.320> plant<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> Steve's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
your plant and this is out of Steve's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.580 
your plant and this is out of Steve's
tank<00:01:56.670> by<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.420> doesn't<00:01:58.380> like

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
tank by the way this is doesn't like

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
yeah you find your big main rhizome here

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
yeah you find your big main rhizome here
and<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> was<00:02:04.320> trying<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.979> cut<00:02:05.700> right

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and what I was trying to do is cut right

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.270 
and what I was trying to do is cut right
beyond<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:07.619> we're<00:02:07.799> using<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.099> razor

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
beyond it so now we're using a razor

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.260 
beyond it so now we're using a razor
blade<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.879> using<00:02:09.030> scissors

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
blade here we're not using scissors

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
blade here we're not using scissors
right<00:02:09.629> yeah<00:02:10.200> razor<00:02:10.530> blades<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> give

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
right yeah razor blades going to give

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
right yeah razor blades going to give
you<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.310> clean<00:02:11.550> cut<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you a really clean cut on it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.640 
you a really clean cut on it
then<00:02:13.510> once<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.840> cut<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.470> kind

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
then once you cut it and you just kind

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.410 
then once you cut it and you just kind
of<00:02:14.680> pull<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:14.920> apart<00:02:15.040> pull<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.819> roots<00:02:15.940> part<00:02:16.240> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
of pull it apart pull the roots part and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.670 
of pull it apart pull the roots part and
that's<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.750> piece<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.170> split<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.500> in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
that's a piece you can split that in

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.010 
that's a piece you can split that in
half<00:02:17.740> if<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.040> want<00:02:18.160> them<00:02:18.459> how<00:02:18.640> far<00:02:19.300> how<00:02:19.990> far

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
half if you want them how far how far

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.930 
half if you want them how far how far
down<00:02:20.500> could<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:20.980> split<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.790> that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
down could you split that like that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.190 
down could you split that like that
little<00:02:22.209> piece<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.660> took<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:22.959> there<00:02:23.110> how

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
little piece we just took off there how

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.570 
little piece we just took off there how
many<00:02:23.380> pieces<00:02:23.650> could<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.040> really<00:02:24.280> break<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
many pieces could you really break it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.830 
many pieces could you really break it
into<00:02:24.700> if<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.970> were<00:02:25.060> desperate<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.600> were<00:02:25.630> like

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
into if you were desperate you were like

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.420 
into if you were desperate you were like
I<00:02:25.959> got<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.440> piece<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.740> anubias<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.130> got<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> turn

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
I got one piece of anubias I got to turn

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.190 
I got one piece of anubias I got to turn
into<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.850> six<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.390> think<00:02:28.810> you'd<00:02:29.080> probably

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
into it like six I think you'd probably

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.449 
into it like six I think you'd probably
get<00:02:29.440> four<00:02:29.709> out<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.010> us

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
get four out of us

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.180 
get four out of us
comfortably<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.720> show<00:02:32.410> show<00:02:32.890> where<00:02:33.100> they

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
comfortably for a show show where they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.520 
comfortably for a show show where they
would<00:02:33.340> be<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.730> mean<00:02:34.480> we're<00:02:34.840> we're<00:02:35.080> winging<00:02:35.440> it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
would be I mean we're we're winging it

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.690 
would be I mean we're we're winging it
here<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.010> know<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.280> depends<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.580> what

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
here because you know it depends on what

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
here because you know it depends on what
you're<00:02:36.790> trying<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.090> with<00:02:37.180> your<00:02:37.300> aquascape

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
you're trying to do with your aquascape

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.850 
you're trying to do with your aquascape
or<00:02:37.840> whatever<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.500> got<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> little

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
or whatever but like you got the little

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.650 
or whatever but like you got the little
nodes<00:02:39.160> yeah<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.030> could<00:02:40.209> probably<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:40.540> these

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
nodes yeah you could probably take these

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.050 
nodes yeah you could probably take these
first<00:02:40.870> three<00:02:41.380> leaves<00:02:42.310> here<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.730> would<00:02:42.850> cut

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
first three leaves here I would cut

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
first three leaves here I would cut
right<00:02:43.209> between<00:02:43.720> them<00:02:44.230> right<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:44.980> front<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
right between them right in front of the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.340 
right between them right in front of the
third<00:02:45.850> leaf<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.870> gonna<00:02:47.019> give<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.230> that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
third leaf that's gonna give you that

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.310 
third leaf that's gonna give you that
three<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.820> would<00:02:48.940> cut<00:02:49.320> again

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
three there and then I would cut again

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.540 
three there and then I would cut again
here<00:02:50.530> at<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> middle<00:02:50.860> where<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.310> kind<00:02:51.489> of

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
here at the middle where it's kind of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.100 
here at the middle where it's kind of
starting<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.910> bend<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.300> bit<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.720> would

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
starting to bend a little bit I would

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.910 
starting to bend a little bit I would
cut<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.380> here<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.620> would<00:02:53.709> give<00:02:53.800> us<00:02:53.860> about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
cut it here that would give us about

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.500 
cut it here that would give us about
five<00:02:54.010> leaves<00:02:54.519> here<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.150> looking<00:02:55.360> for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
five leaves here and we're looking for

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.390 
five leaves here and we're looking for
natural<00:02:55.660> breaks<00:02:56.200> -<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.500> mean<00:02:56.709> spots<00:02:57.010> where<00:02:57.220> it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
natural breaks - I mean spots where it's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.340 
natural breaks - I mean spots where it's
you<00:02:57.640> know<00:02:57.760> that's<00:02:58.180> exactly<00:02:58.690> right<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.019> then

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
you know that's exactly right and then

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.449 
you know that's exactly right and then
on<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.590> side<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.830> can<00:02:59.950> kind<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.190> see<00:03:00.340> where

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
on this side you can kind of see where

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.190 
on this side you can kind of see where
it's<00:03:00.610> starting<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.910> shoot<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.390> way<00:03:01.630> you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's starting to shoot up this way you

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.420 
it's starting to shoot up this way you
cut<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.440> right<00:03:02.680> there<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.040> front<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.340> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
cut it right there in front of that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.470 
cut it right there in front of that
that's<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.880> give<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.180> peace<00:03:04.330> if

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
that's going to give you for peace if

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.640 
that's going to give you for peace if
you're<00:03:04.540> desperate<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.959> could<00:03:04.989> cut<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.350> again

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you're desperate you could cut it again

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.710 
you're desperate you could cut it again
here<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.550> probably<00:03:07.090> won't<00:03:07.269> leave<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.569> piece

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
here but probably won't leave this piece

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.120 
here but probably won't leave this piece
alone<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.290> then<00:03:08.440> what<00:03:08.590> do<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.739> do<00:03:08.890> with<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
alone and then what do you do with the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.590 
alone and then what do you do with the
leaves<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.400> look<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:09.970> when<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.269> cut<00:03:10.450> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
leaves that look so so when you cut it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.759 
leaves that look so so when you cut it
you<00:03:10.630> leave<00:03:10.870> them<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.080> there<00:03:11.260> till<00:03:11.470> new<00:03:11.590> leaves

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
you leave them on there till new leaves

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.740 
you leave them on there till new leaves
come<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.280> nucleus<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.090> don't<00:03:13.239> ever<00:03:13.360> take<00:03:13.569> off

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
come on nucleus I don't ever take off

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.880 
come on nucleus I don't ever take off
the<00:03:13.900> leaves<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.230> always<00:03:14.380> leave<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.650> on<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the leaves I always leave it on the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.229 
the leaves I always leave it on the
plant<00:03:15.100> will<00:03:15.250> absorb<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.550> nutrients<00:03:16.090> and

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
plant will absorb the nutrients and

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.759 
plant will absorb the nutrients and
thyme<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.540> even<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.110> believes<00:03:17.470> looking

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
thyme is even with the believes looking

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.890 
thyme is even with the believes looking
Krunk<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.790> an<00:03:18.940> Amazon<00:03:19.180> sword<00:03:19.570> where<00:03:19.810> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
Krunk on like an Amazon sword where you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.030 
Krunk on like an Amazon sword where you
would<00:03:20.019> want<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.200> take<00:03:20.380> off<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.680> leaves<00:03:20.829> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
would want to take off the leaves and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710 
would want to take off the leaves and
new<00:03:21.190> leaves<00:03:21.370> would<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.549> coming<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.880> exactly

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
new leaves would be coming up exactly

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.600 
new leaves would be coming up exactly
myself<00:03:23.200> I've<00:03:23.620> always<00:03:23.890> just<00:03:24.220> left<00:03:24.400> them<00:03:24.519> on

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
myself I've always just left them on

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.780 
myself I've always just left them on
there<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:24.970> they're<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.239> slow<00:03:25.480> growing

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
there because they're so slow growing

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.979 
there because they're so slow growing
even<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.940> leaf<00:03:28.120> like<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.660> going<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.810> do

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
even a leaf like this is going to do

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.289 
even a leaf like this is going to do
some<00:03:29.170> good<00:03:29.320> on<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.500> new<00:03:29.590> visa<00:03:29.739> Commission<00:03:30.670> so

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
some good on a new visa Commission so

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.330 
some good on a new visa Commission so
yeah<00:03:31.870> keep<00:03:32.140> cutting<00:03:32.470> man<00:03:32.620> show<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.860> little<00:03:33.070> this

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
yeah keep cutting man show a little this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.850 
yeah keep cutting man show a little this
all<00:03:33.940> right<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.480> got<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.709> one

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
all right so we got that on this one

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.289 
all right so we got that on this one
here<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> plant<00:03:36.370> started<00:03:36.579> growing<00:03:36.790> off<00:03:37.000> on

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
here the plant started growing off on

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.720 
here the plant started growing off on
its<00:03:37.900> own<00:03:37.989> little<00:03:38.140> angle<00:03:38.500> here<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:38.950> we're<00:03:39.640> going

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
its own little angle here so we're going

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.920 
its own little angle here so we're going
to<00:03:39.790> split<00:03:39.940> down<00:03:40.180> here<00:03:40.329> at<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> base

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.490 

and<00:03:46.560> pull<00:03:46.739> another<00:03:46.980> piece<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:49.319> want<00:03:49.440> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
and pull another piece there you want to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.570 
and pull another piece there you want to
make<00:03:49.590> sure<00:03:49.620> you're<00:03:49.890> leaving<00:03:50.099> roots<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.459> all

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
make sure you're leaving roots on all

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.890 
make sure you're leaving roots on all
these<00:03:50.700> pieces<00:03:50.940> if<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.239> take<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.629> cent<00:03:51.870> that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
these pieces if you take a cent that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.570 
these pieces if you take a cent that
many<00:03:52.230> roots<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.620> going<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.799> be<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.040> lot<00:03:53.430> harder

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
many roots it's going to be a lot harder

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.890 
many roots it's going to be a lot harder
if<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.819> get<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.330> again<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:56.780> then<00:03:57.780> what

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
if you get it going again and then what

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.210 
if you get it going again and then what
do<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.080> do<00:03:58.230> with<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.500> roots<00:03:58.709> bro<00:03:58.920> would<00:03:59.129> you

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
do you do with the roots bro would you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.300 
do you do with the roots bro would you
keep<00:03:59.370> them<00:03:59.489> long<00:03:59.700> because<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.540> trimmer<00:04:00.810> but

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
keep them long because I'm a trimmer but

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.009 
keep them long because I'm a trimmer but
myself<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.120> leave<00:04:03.269> them<00:04:03.360> longer<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
myself I like to leave them longer I

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.949 
myself I like to leave them longer I
guess<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.829> could<00:04:05.010> trim<00:04:05.250> them<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.659> plants

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
guess you could trim them but the plants

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.330 
guess you could trim them but the plants
already<00:04:07.049> grown<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.590> absorb<00:04:07.829> nutrients<00:04:08.250> I

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
already grown to absorb nutrients I

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.710 
already grown to absorb nutrients I
wouldn't<00:04:08.610> really<00:04:09.060> want<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.329> take<00:04:09.450> them<00:04:09.569> off<00:04:09.659> of

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
wouldn't really want to take them off of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.690 
wouldn't really want to take them off of
the<00:04:09.959> anubius<00:04:10.379> since<00:04:10.590> they're<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:10.860> slow<00:04:11.129> yeah

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the anubius since they're so slow yeah

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.119 
the anubius since they're so slow yeah
all<00:04:12.269> right<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:13.590> one<00:04:13.739> here<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:13.950> kind<00:04:14.040> of

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
all right this one here is kind of

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.370 
all right this one here is kind of
difficult<00:04:14.310> because<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.849> like<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> big<00:04:15.150> game

Kyle we're talking about maybe cutting
it<00:06:06.390> here<00:06:06.660> kind<00:06:07.230> of<00:06:07.290> getting<00:06:07.470> this<00:06:07.560> piece<00:06:07.770> off

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
it here kind of getting this piece off

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.860 
it here kind of getting this piece off
here<00:06:08.070> exactly<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.120> pull<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.420> leaves<00:06:09.630> out<00:06:09.840> a

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
little bit you can kind of see where the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.250 
little bit you can kind of see where the
plant<00:06:11.490> would<00:06:11.580> match<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:12.540> natural<00:06:12.750> breaks

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
plant would match the natural breaks

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.420 
plant would match the natural breaks

you don't have it don't do it like it's
like<00:06:16.290> we're<00:06:16.650> not<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:16.800> don't<00:06:17.220> want<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.550> cut<00:06:17.700> this

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
like we're not I don't want to cut this

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.280
