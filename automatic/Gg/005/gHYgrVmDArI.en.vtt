00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
someone in a modern warfare 3 now as i

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.970 
someone in a modern warfare 3 now as i
said<00:01:34.370> before<00:01:34.490> i'm<00:01:34.790> using<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.240> specialist

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
said before i'm using the specialist

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.100 
said before i'm using the specialist
pointstreak<00:01:36.980> package<00:01:37.820> i<00:01:37.940> really<00:01:38.930> recommend

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
pointstreak package i really recommend

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.230 
pointstreak package i really recommend
using<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.770> specialist<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.490> makes<00:01:40.730> it<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.090> much

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
using the specialist it makes it so much

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.080 
using the specialist it makes it so much
easier<00:01:41.480> once<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.960> get<00:01:42.230> those<00:01:42.700> 88<00:01:43.700> point

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
easier once you get those 88 point

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.000 
easier once you get those 88 point
streak<00:01:44.390> or<00:01:44.540> seven<00:01:44.900> if<00:01:45.020> you're<00:01:45.170> using<00:01:45.410> hardline

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
streak or seven if you're using hardline

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.560 
streak or seven if you're using hardline
because<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.550> basically<00:01:46.700> become<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.180> super

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
because you basically become a super

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.240 
because you basically become a super
soldier<00:01:47.750> if<00:01:47.990> you've<00:01:48.140> got<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.350> half<00:01:48.590> decent<00:01:48.830> aim

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
soldier if you've got a half decent aim

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.310 
soldier if you've got a half decent aim

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you will not lose a gunfight unless you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.370 
you will not lose a gunfight unless you
put<00:01:51.530> yourself<00:01:51.860> into<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.250> stupid<00:01:53.030> situation<00:01:53.840> so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.530 
i actually get my mo bin this video so
as<00:03:10.130> i<00:03:10.250> was<00:03:10.280> saying<00:03:10.370> before<00:03:10.640> stick<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.510> your

class<00:03:13.520> setup<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.000> will<00:03:14.030> hopefully<00:03:14.330> be

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
class setup you will hopefully be

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.930 
class setup you will hopefully be
successful<00:03:15.230> after<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.620> while<00:03:15.830> now<00:03:16.460> this<00:03:16.670> isn't

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
successful after a while now this isn't

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.190 
successful after a while now this isn't
going<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.090> guarantee<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.720> getting<00:03:17.960> a<00:03:18.020> mode

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
going to guarantee you getting a mode

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.860 
going to guarantee you getting a mode
but<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.440> is<00:03:18.650> certainly<00:03:19.240> probably<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.480> easiest

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
but it is certainly probably the easiest

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.360 
but it is certainly probably the easiest
way<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.620> you're<00:03:21.770> still<00:03:21.980> going<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.220> be

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
way to get it you're still going to be

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.420 
way to get it you're still going to be
struggling<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.960> get<00:03:24.110> one<00:03:24.290> because<00:03:24.440> 25<00:03:25.040> kills

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
struggling to get one because 25 kills

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.270 
struggling to get one because 25 kills
without<00:03:25.670> killstreaks<00:03:26.330> is<00:03:27.280> incredibly

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
without killstreaks is incredibly

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.710 
without killstreaks is incredibly
difficult<00:03:28.550> i<00:03:28.850> don't<00:03:29.030> think<00:03:29.240> people<00:03:29.420> really

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
difficult i don't think people really

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.350 
difficult i don't think people really
understand<00:03:30.440> or<00:03:30.920> grasp<00:03:31.220> how<00:03:31.730> difficult<00:03:32.180> it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
understand or grasp how difficult it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.030 
understand or grasp how difficult it
actually<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.840> because<00:03:33.140> there's<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.470> many<00:03:33.590> mobi

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
actually is because there's so many mobi

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.950 
actually is because there's so many mobi
