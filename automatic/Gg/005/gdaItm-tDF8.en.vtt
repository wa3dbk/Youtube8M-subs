you can't use the con that you generated

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
you can't use the con that you generated
also<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.710> fades<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.399> time<00:01:53.670> passes<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
also it fades as time passes so if you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
also it fades as time passes so if you
cause<00:01:55.259> con<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.040> generated<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.909> should

cause con to be generated you should

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
cause con to be generated you should

by<00:02:23.819> using<00:02:23.970> standard<00:02:24.599> techniques<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.200> guess

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
by using standard techniques I guess

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.490 
by using standard techniques I guess
it's<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:26.569> when<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.599> know<00:02:27.900> attacks

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.460 

those<00:02:32.070> are<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.310> Conde<00:02:32.940> jizz<00:02:33.240> next<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.320> your

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
those are the Conde jizz next to your

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.080 
those are the Conde jizz next to your
health<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> guess<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.460> you're<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> wizard

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
health so I guess if you're a wizard

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.370 
health so I guess if you're a wizard
york<00:02:39.960> on<00:02:40.290> gage<00:02:40.620> will<00:02:41.100> disappear<00:02:41.760> over<00:02:42.330> time<00:02:42.750> or

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
york on gage will disappear over time or

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.350 
york on gage will disappear over time or
after<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.830> move<00:02:44.010> around<00:02:44.340> or<00:02:44.670> something<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
after you move around or something and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.080 
after you move around or something and
then<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.200> strength<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.740> your<00:02:46.790> strength<00:02:47.790> on

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
then the strength of your strength on

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:59.420 
then the strength of your strength on
you<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.200> keep<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.620> until<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.459> use<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.970> skill

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.869 

oh<00:03:00.469> so<00:03:01.469> that's<00:03:01.590> what<00:03:01.890> those<00:03:02.040> things<00:03:02.310> are<00:03:02.640> on

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
oh so that's what those things are on

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.209 
oh so that's what those things are on
the<00:03:03.030> side<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.420> map<00:03:03.629> those<00:03:03.959> are<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
the side of the map those are the

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.630 
the side of the map those are the
attribute<00:03:05.239> Khan<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:07.319> very<00:03:08.040> environmental

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
attribute Khan and very environmental

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.250 
attribute Khan and very environmental
gone

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.750 

so<00:03:13.260> i<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.470> use<00:03:13.620> skills<00:03:14.040> more<00:03:14.280> easily<00:03:14.670> when

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
