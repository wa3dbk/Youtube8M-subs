00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
anything like that so I was actually in

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.929 
anything like that so I was actually in
the<00:00:26.880> process<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.599> replacing<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.609> rear

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the process of replacing the this rear

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.690 
the process of replacing the this rear
wheel<00:00:30.210> bearing<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> drivers<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
wheel bearing and on the drivers on the
passenger<00:00:33.239> side<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> was

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
passenger side actually and when I was

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.680 
passenger side actually and when I was
taking<00:00:35.399> them<00:00:35.489> apart<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
taking them apart I actually think I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600
