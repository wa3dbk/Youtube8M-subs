00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.040 

every<00:00:02.450> once<00:00:02.720> in<00:00:02.900> a<00:00:03.020> while<00:00:03.170> my<00:00:03.650> dreads<00:00:04.009> will<00:00:05.050> do

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.050 
every once in a while my dreads will do

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.220 
every once in a while my dreads will do
this<00:00:06.680> thing<00:00:06.920> where<00:00:07.040> they<00:00:07.190> loop<00:00:07.599> they're<00:00:08.599> like

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
this thing where they loop they're like

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.560 
this thing where they loop they're like
bumpy<00:00:09.769> and<00:00:10.519> not<00:00:10.759> really<00:00:11.089> round<00:00:13.419> so<00:00:14.419> what<00:00:14.539> I

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
bumpy and not really round so what I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.200 
bumpy and not really round so what I
like<00:00:14.749> to<00:00:14.780> do<00:00:15.139> is<00:00:15.169> I<00:00:15.469> take<00:00:15.799> I<00:00:16.070> take<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.789> loop<00:00:17.000> and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
like to do is I take I take the loop and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.689 
like to do is I take I take the loop and
I<00:00:17.330> work<00:00:18.230> a<00:00:18.439> hole<00:00:18.769> into<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.160> with<00:00:19.250> my<00:00:19.369> finger

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
I work a hole into it with my finger

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:27.189 
I work a hole into it with my finger
like<00:00:20.570> that<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:24.259> I<00:00:25.359> just<00:00:26.359> pull<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.960> dread

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
like that and then I just pull the dread

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.840 
like that and then I just pull the dread
through<00:00:27.789> like<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:29.080> not<00:00:32.890> there<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> push<00:00:34.670> it

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
through like a not there and push it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.190 
through like a not there and push it
through<00:00:37.180> there

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.550 

now<00:00:41.860> it's<00:00:42.130> like<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.370> big<00:00:42.610> knot

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
now it's like a big knot

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.360 
now it's like a big knot
and<00:00:45.100> after<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.400> do<00:00:45.580> all<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.730> loops<00:00:46.060> I<00:00:47.370> go

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
and after I do all the loops I go

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.540 
and after I do all the loops I go
through<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:51.540> back<00:00:52.540> home<00:00:52.780> ends<00:00:53.400> my<00:00:54.400> hands

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
through and back home ends my hands

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.650 
through and back home ends my hands
don't<00:00:54.700> like<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.060> say<00:00:55.300> together<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.240> have

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
don't like to say together then I have

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.690 
don't like to say together then I have
this<00:00:58.900> step<00:01:01.680> curls<00:01:02.680> rock<00:01:03.420> curl<00:01:04.420> amplifier<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
this step curls rock curl amplifier and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.150 
this step curls rock curl amplifier and
I<00:01:06.730> know<00:01:06.910> it's<00:01:07.060> probably<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.630> for<00:01:07.840> dreads<00:01:08.170> but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
I know it's probably not for dreads but

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.640 
I know it's probably not for dreads but
I<00:01:09.190> had<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:09.900> smells<00:01:10.900> good<00:01:11.050> and<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.900> just<00:01:14.410> like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
I had it smells good and it's just like

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.000 
I had it smells good and it's just like
us<00:01:15.310> sticking<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.880> stuff<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.680> just<00:01:17.740> like

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
us sticking this stuff and I just like

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.330 
us sticking this stuff and I just like
to<00:01:18.190> use<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.550> because<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.680> keeps<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.070> frizz

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
to use it because it keeps the frizz

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.670 
to use it because it keeps the frizz
down<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:25.180> also<00:01:25.420> makes<00:01:25.600> my<00:01:25.930> dress

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.500 

and<00:01:30.250> then<00:01:30.370> separate<00:01:30.880> each<00:01:31.090> one<00:01:31.330> make<00:01:31.600> sure<00:01:33.510> not

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
and then separate each one make sure not

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.550 
and then separate each one make sure not
connected<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:36.040> others

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:57.890 

two

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:10.150 

bottom<00:01:58.740> layer<00:01:59.300> is<00:02:00.300> much<00:02:00.690> better<00:02:06.020> some<00:02:07.020> reason

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.100 

top<00:02:11.160> layer<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.490> does<00:02:11.820> not<00:02:12.000> want<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.330> hold<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
top layer just does not want to hold and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320 
top layer just does not want to hold and
then<00:02:16.410> someone<00:02:16.650> suggested<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.790> me<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.240> was

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
then someone suggested to me that it was

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.030 
then someone suggested to me that it was
because<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:20.270> wash<00:02:21.270> my<00:02:21.450> hair<00:02:21.600> too<00:02:21.780> often<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
because I wash my hair too often and the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.740 
because I wash my hair too often and the
water<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.520> doesn't<00:02:25.670> work<00:02:26.670> well<00:02:27.000> with<00:02:27.210> baby

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
water just doesn't work well with baby

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.840 
water just doesn't work well with baby
dreads<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.230> guess

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.200 

so<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.950> only<00:02:35.950> wash<00:02:36.100> my<00:02:36.280> hair<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.490> once<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.030> week

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
so I only wash my hair that once a week

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:46.770 
so I only wash my hair that once a week
now<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:41.550> think<00:02:42.550> it's<00:02:42.670> helping<00:02:45.000> welcome<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
now I think it's helping welcome in the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.000 
now I think it's helping welcome in the
top<00:02:47.020> now<00:02:47.490> my<00:02:48.490> hand<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:50.500> wash<00:02:50.620> my<00:02:50.800> bangs

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
top now my hand to me to wash my bangs

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:30.440 
top now my hand to me to wash my bangs
more<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:53.320> they<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:53.590> greasy

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.120
