 Hello dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.690
 my channel with you can not with this 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.810
 age I will start to make guides on different 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.940
 topic here is battlefield live free 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.109
 own and g3 a4 one of the first to 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.289
 list of German assault rifle to 34 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.980
 does not require opening represents 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.409
 standard attack aircraft 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.230
 her characteristics are bad to me 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.899
 maximum 45 minimum 14 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.180
 capacity standard luck for 20 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.170
 ammo rate of fire 600 shots 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 per minute 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 possesses medium range and low 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.730
 shooting accuracy 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.269
 recharge time is 4.1 seconds 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.160
 g3 construction 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.910
 found its reflection 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.450
 policy oppo mp5 and automatically everything 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.330
 three logically g3 a4 should be 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.550
 sniper rifle to the same closed 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.760
 beta testing had a completely different 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.360
 telescopic folding model design 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150
 butt 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.540
 later and still and has fixed 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.950
 butt therefore we have not g3 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 a4 modification g3 a3 which are mine 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.420
 familiar in games is bad company 2 and 3 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.369
 parts battlefield 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.729
 Beginners will find it very difficult to play with g3 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.540
 a4 without skirts as she is indomitable 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.300
 cottages 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.000
 I gave too little shop for 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.720
 every gate kill function is always 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.980
 recharge recharge find 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 long you will often have to seek shelter 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.450
 something 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 become easy prey based on these 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 conclusions can be said that 2 3 4 days three 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 backwards 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.320
 most likely a weapon of support and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.270
 defense wanna make make low 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 what are the advantages 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.980
 shots from gta4 pretty powerful 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 invested 100 meters almost not 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.259
 losing power and gear together and bad 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.360
 show yourself shooting offhand 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.360
 whatever coca stands 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.629
 DI sight looks normal 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 but because of the return over long distances to you 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.280
 will have to shoot in short bursts 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.230
 so as not to lose purpose for convenience 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.190
 you can put a red sight collimator 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.420
 dot sm 145 g3 a4 turns 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.690
 sniper rifle 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.909
 As for the dodger on the trunk, I 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.090
 I recommend to put heliborne or 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.000
 booth stands at the viper max shop or 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.410
 butt tactical casket 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 fighter and stabilizing g3 a4 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.900
 principle liked with him can play and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.030
 even need to play first assault 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.069
 rifles you must have the same 3 o 4 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.790
 to further represent and from 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.850
 what other assault gun weapons are made of 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 g3 extremely powerful weapon 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 apt shooter professional this 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 rifle well show yourself on any 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.710
 distances 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.330
 g3 is of little use in active battles 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.300
 premises in principle 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.710
