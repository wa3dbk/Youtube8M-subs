now<00:00:08.820> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> move<00:00:09.480> called<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> spin

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
now we're going to move called the spin

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320 
now we're going to move called the spin
step<00:00:10.500> looks<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.400> module<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
step looks like this module from the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.759 
step looks like this module from the
side<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> spin<00:00:22.230> step<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
side so as you can see the spin step is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
side so as you can see the spin step is
a<00:00:22.800> move<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.189> fun<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.359> looks<00:00:24.539> great

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
a move that's fun to do it looks great

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.740 
a move that's fun to do it looks great
as<00:00:25.470> many<00:00:25.800> variations<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.539> particular

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
as many variations I like in particular

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380 
as many variations I like in particular
because<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.710> easy<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> combo<00:00:29.580> within<00:00:30.269> your

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
because it's easy to combo within your

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
because it's easy to combo within your
dance<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> puts<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:31.679> strong<00:00:31.920> accent

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
dance and it puts a really strong accent

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.780 
dance and it puts a really strong accent
to<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.030> freestyle<00:00:33.600> dance<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.550> get

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to your freestyle dance so let's get

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
to your freestyle dance so let's get
into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> steps<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:37.380> thing<00:00:37.530> we're

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
into the steps now first thing we're

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
into the steps now first thing we're
going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.730> basic<00:00:39.239> step<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.570> call<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
going to do is this basic step I call it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
going to do is this basic step I call it
skipping<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.500> looks<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
skipping back looks like this so as you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.170 
skipping back looks like this so as you
can<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.010> simply<00:00:50.700> skipping

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
can see it it's just simply skipping

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.139 
can see it it's just simply skipping
back<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.410> kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.070> house<00:00:53.309> dance<00:00:53.610> move<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
back it is kind of a house dance move I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
back it is kind of a house dance move I
don't<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:56.039> own<00:00:56.070> house

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
don't use it so much in my own house

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.439 
don't use it so much in my own house
dance<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.879> doesn't<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.210> match<00:00:57.420> my

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
dance because it doesn't really match my

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
dance because it doesn't really match my
style<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.070> fundamental<00:00:59.760> motion<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
style but the fundamental motion of it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
style but the fundamental motion of it
is<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.809> useful<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.980> we're

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
is really useful as you can see we're

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
is really useful as you can see we're
applying<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> spin<00:01:03.570> step<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> let's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
applying it to the spin step so let's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
applying it to the spin step so let's
start<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.000> by<00:01:06.030> getting<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.840> skipping<00:01:07.260> back

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
start off by getting the skipping back

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.570 
start off by getting the skipping back
motion<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:09.119> simply<00:01:09.540> doing<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.680> reverse

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
motion and it's simply doing a reverse

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.020 
motion and it's simply doing a reverse
running<00:01:12.060> man<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.840> where's<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> running<00:01:13.439> man

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
running man so where's the running man

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630 
running man so where's the running man
you're<00:01:15.409> shuffling<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.470> feet<00:01:16.530> back<00:01:16.890> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you're shuffling your feet back when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
you're shuffling your feet back when
you're<00:01:17.759> skipping<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.570> just

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you're skipping back you're just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.560 
you're skipping back you're just
shuffling<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.170> feet<00:01:19.229> forward<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
shuffling your feet forward like this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.980 
shuffling your feet forward like this
it's<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.659> thing<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's like that so the other thing that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's like that so the other thing that
I'm<00:01:25.140> adding<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.400> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I'm adding to it is that I'm just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
I'm adding to it is that I'm just
stepping<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.090> behind<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:28.290> I'm

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
stepping a little behind time I'm

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.499 
stepping a little behind time I'm
skipping<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.939> start<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
skipping back so you can start it just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.100 
skipping back so you can start it just
by<00:01:30.890> practicing<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> reverse<00:01:32.340> Running<00:01:32.759> Man<00:01:33.110> by

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
by practicing the reverse Running Man by

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.969 
by practicing the reverse Running Man by
shuffling<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.740> feet<00:01:34.799> forward<00:01:35.360> while

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
shuffling your feet forward while

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.230 
shuffling your feet forward while
skipping<00:01:37.979> back<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.030> lift

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
skipping back with that so you just lift

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.560 
skipping back with that so you just lift
one<00:01:39.299> knee<00:01:39.680> shuffle<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> other<00:01:40.890> foot<00:01:41.130> forward

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
one knee shuffle the other foot forward

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.740 
one knee shuffle the other foot forward
couple<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> foot<00:01:42.869> forward<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
couple the foot forward like that and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
couple the foot forward like that and
then<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.020> ready<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
then when you're ready for it you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.230 
then when you're ready for it you
integrate<00:01:47.930> stepping<00:01:48.930> behind<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.710> little

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
integrate stepping behind you a little

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.540 
integrate stepping behind you a little
bit

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.340 

so<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.790> see<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.000> from<00:01:55.120> behind<00:02:00.270> I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so you can see it from behind I'm

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.000 
so you can see it from behind I'm
shuffling<00:02:02.350> back

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
shuffling back

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.700 
shuffling back
I'm<00:02:03.220> also<00:02:03.610> stepping<00:02:03.940> behind<00:02:04.210> me<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.810> then

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
I'm also stepping behind me and then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.980 
I'm also stepping behind me and then
finally<00:02:06.370> if<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.520> want<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.940> can<00:02:07.030> integrate

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
finally if you want you can integrate

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.340 
finally if you want you can integrate
your<00:02:08.890> arm<00:02:09.070> movements<00:02:09.700> just<00:02:10.270> cycling<00:02:10.960> that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
your arm movements just cycling that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.800 
your arm movements just cycling that
which<00:02:11.980> will<00:02:12.160> help<00:02:12.340> give<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:13.300> momentum

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
which will help give you that momentum

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.290 
which will help give you that momentum
to<00:02:13.840> do<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> skipping<00:02:14.470> back<00:02:14.710> motion<00:02:14.950> faster<00:02:15.580> so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
to do a skipping back motion faster so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.550 
to do a skipping back motion faster so
let's<00:02:16.450> try<00:02:16.630> with<00:02:16.780> me<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> skipping<00:02:17.440> back

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
let's try with me the skipping back

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.940 
let's try with me the skipping back
motion<00:02:17.800> slowly<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.670> my<00:02:19.030> account<00:02:19.300> 5<00:02:20.230> 6<00:02:21.360> 7<00:02:22.360> 8<00:02:22.680> 1<00:02:23.680> 2

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
motion slowly on my account 5 6 7 8 1 2

7<00:02:44.440> 8<00:02:45.660> great<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.980> practice<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.610> first<00:02:48.820> get

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
7 8 great so practice that first get

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.540 
7 8 great so practice that first get
that<00:02:49.750> fundamental<00:02:50.380> motion<00:02:50.710> down<00:02:50.860> before

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
that fundamental motion down before

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.580 
that fundamental motion down before
actually<00:02:51.910> doing<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.270> spin<00:02:52.480> step<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.110> spins<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
actually doing the spin step it spins it

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.320 
actually doing the spin step it spins it
a<00:02:53.620> little<00:02:53.890> faster<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> little

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
a little faster this is a little

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.100 
a little faster this is a little
trickier<00:02:56.730> alright<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.270> once<00:02:58.630> we<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.930> that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
trickier alright so once we have that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.920 
trickier alright so once we have that
basic<00:02:59.800> step<00:03:00.010> down<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.209> go<00:03:01.330> into<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> spin

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
basic step down we can go into the spin

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.570 
basic step down we can go into the spin
step<00:03:02.200> down<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.489> do<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.760> spin<00:03:04.000> step<00:03:05.580> instead

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
step down so to do the spin step instead

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.740 
step down so to do the spin step instead
of<00:03:06.790> stepping<00:03:07.630> down<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:09.360> when<00:03:10.360> we're<00:03:10.510> doing

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
of stepping down as you when we're doing

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.090 
of stepping down as you when we're doing
that<00:03:10.900> skipping<00:03:11.290> back<00:03:11.380> motion<00:03:11.680> you're<00:03:11.980> just

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
that skipping back motion you're just

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.310 
that skipping back motion you're just
going<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> toe<00:03:12.670> tap<00:03:12.970> behind<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.200> you're

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
going to do a toe tap behind so you're

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.560 
going to do a toe tap behind so you're
going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> hook<00:03:14.680> behind<00:03:14.890> top<00:03:15.820> quickly<00:03:16.330> and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
going to hook behind top quickly and

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.100 
going to hook behind top quickly and
then<00:03:17.350> come<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.650> into<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:17.980> spread<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:18.580> that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
then come out into this spread like that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.140 
then come out into this spread like that
so<00:03:20.110> just<00:03:20.140> spreading<00:03:20.950> out<00:03:21.100> your<00:03:21.220> legs<00:03:21.430> into

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
so just spreading out your legs into

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.240 
so just spreading out your legs into
nice<00:03:22.450> stance<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.410> then<00:03:23.800> we're<00:03:23.920> going<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.100> do

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
nice stance and then we're going to do

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.670 
nice stance and then we're going to do
it<00:03:24.340> again<00:03:24.430> you're<00:03:25.209> going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.450> shuffle<00:03:26.260> foot

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
it again you're going to shuffle foot

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.380 
it again you're going to shuffle foot
back<00:03:27.420> tap<00:03:28.420> behind<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.110> on<00:03:29.380> your<00:03:29.590> toe<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.390> then

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
back tap behind you on your toe and then

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.160 
back tap behind you on your toe and then
come<00:03:31.630> out<00:03:31.750> opening<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.989> little

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
come out opening like that it's a little

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.100 
come out opening like that it's a little
bit<00:03:35.380> tricky<00:03:35.739> doing<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.100> slow<00:03:36.400> but<00:03:37.360> we'll<00:03:37.690> go

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
bit tricky doing it slow but we'll go

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.350 
bit tricky doing it slow but we'll go
through<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.560> practices<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.489> when<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.060> when

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
through the practices and when you when

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.140 
through the practices and when you when
your<00:03:40.480> body<00:03:41.010> memorizes<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.550> motions<00:03:42.970> down

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
your body memorizes the motions down

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.610 
your body memorizes the motions down
then<00:03:43.450> you'll<00:03:43.540> find<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.870> pretty<00:03:43.900> balanced<00:03:44.500> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
then you'll find it pretty balanced and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.790 
then you'll find it pretty balanced and
easy<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:45.010> do<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:46.090> we're<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.330> start<00:03:46.540> off

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
easy to do so we're going to start off

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.699 
easy to do so we're going to start off
with<00:03:47.800> one<00:03:48.040> foot<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.340> front<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:49.350> then<00:03:50.350> I'm

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
with one foot in front and then I'm

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.430 
with one foot in front and then I'm
going<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.340> skip<00:03:51.640> back<00:03:52.290> tap

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
going to skip back tap

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.580 
going to skip back tap
hooking<00:03:55.440> behind<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.790> spreading<00:03:57.210> out

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
hooking behind and then spreading out

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.250 
hooking behind and then spreading out
going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.830> again<00:03:59.100> just<00:03:59.810> my<00:04:00.810> left<00:04:01.020> knee<00:04:01.200> is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
going to it again just my left knee is

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.790 
going to it again just my left knee is
gonna<00:04:01.440> lift<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.880> top<00:04:03.230> coming<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.500> spread

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
gonna lift up top coming to a spread

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.790 
gonna lift up top coming to a spread
like<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.540> right<00:04:06.540> knee<00:04:06.750> up<00:04:07.070> shuffling<00:04:08.070> tap

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
like that right knee up shuffling tap

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.870 
like that right knee up shuffling tap
spread<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:13.140> we're<00:04:14.010> pretty<00:04:14.190> much<00:04:14.310> doing<00:04:14.640> like

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
spread so we're pretty much doing like

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.690 
spread so we're pretty much doing like
these<00:04:15.030> 180<00:04:15.510> turns<00:04:15.870> from<00:04:16.140> side<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.410> side<00:04:16.700> when

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
these 180 turns from side to side when

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.520 
these 180 turns from side to side when
you're<00:04:17.820> doing<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.090> spin<00:04:18.299> step<00:04:18.600> later<00:04:19.140> on<00:04:19.350> well

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
you're doing the spin step later on well

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.710 
you're doing the spin step later on well
I<00:04:19.560> don't<00:04:19.799> know<00:04:19.860> 360<00:04:20.190> or<00:04:20.790> 270

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
I don't know 360 or 270

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.820 
I don't know 360 or 270
turning<00:04:22.470> as<00:04:22.530> far<00:04:22.890> as<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.130> can<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.750> try<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.650> with

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
turning as far as you can so try it with

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.720 
turning as far as you can so try it with
me<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.070> my<00:04:26.310> count

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
step with the right foot forward we're

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.770 
step with the right foot forward we're
gonna<00:04:28.530> do<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.740> set<00:04:29.670> me<00:04:29.820> slow<00:04:30.090> doing<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.660> too

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
gonna do it set me slow doing it too

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.480 
gonna do it set me slow doing it too
slow<00:04:31.020> we're<00:04:31.230> gonna<00:04:31.380> lose<00:04:31.530> their<00:04:31.680> balance<00:04:31.800> on

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
slow we're gonna lose their balance on

great so you can see that I'm kind of
doing<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:03.150> really<00:05:03.480> exaggerated<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:04.380> recommend

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
doing it really exaggerated I recommend

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.190 
doing it really exaggerated I recommend
you<00:05:05.250> do<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:05.760> form<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.960> more<00:05:07.110> the

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
you do it this form this is more the

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.990 
you do it this form this is more the
house<00:05:07.350> dance<00:05:07.650> style<00:05:07.920> obviously<00:05:08.130> if<00:05:08.850> you're

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
house dance style obviously if you're

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.490 
house dance style obviously if you're
doing<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.270> club<00:05:09.420> dance<00:05:09.720> style<00:05:10.020> it'll<00:05:10.410> be

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
doing a club dance style it'll be

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.560 
doing a club dance style it'll be
smaller<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:14.550> it's<00:05:14.730> pretty<00:05:14.940> easy<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.300> scale

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
smaller but it's pretty easy to scale

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.570 
smaller but it's pretty easy to scale
back<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.960> doing<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.260> big<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:17.070> small<00:05:17.310> so<00:05:17.520> I

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
back and doing it big and small so I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.490 
back and doing it big and small so I
recommend<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.510> practices<00:05:19.050> we<00:05:19.320> do

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
recommend that and the practices we do

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.520 
recommend that and the practices we do
it<00:05:19.590> pretty<00:05:19.800> big<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:21.240> one<00:05:21.690> more<00:05:21.870> time<00:05:21.900> let's<00:05:22.290> do

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
it pretty big so one more time let's do

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.040 
it pretty big so one more time let's do
