 hello to you all people 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.840
 A good night to you guys are with here. 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.109
 on the site of the globe you are seeing there and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.609
 I just wanted to show you some questions. 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.250
 interesting because people come 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.590
 proliferating the concern of the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.529
 scientists is where things will stop is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.800
 the globe website you are seeing here and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 Here is a story aimed at 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.510
 promotes online meeting to deny 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.579
 the end of the world 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 scientists of the American space agency 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.050
 respond to the public's doubts about the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.210
 little lips supposedly predicted by 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.649
 Mayas and December 21 , 2012 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.430
 here's even an illustration everyone 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.870
 You do not talk. 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 our shock of a great object 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.539
 happens by the planet x or nibiru exists 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 had already been detected by astronomers 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.229
 Remember me 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 the event of an eye in the approach of the day 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.070
 December 21, 2012 date when 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.590
 some people believe that the old 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 Mayan civilization predicted the end of the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 increase in the flow of messages by asking 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 clarification on the subject 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.180
 five nasa scientists participate this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 week of a debate on the internet for 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.229
 respond to public inquiries 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 landim account in google social network 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 plus space agency specialists 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.170
 rejected American theories 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.290
 apocalyptic phenomena such as that of a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 wanderer called nibiru the planet x 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
 would shock with up to r they tried to put 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 one foot in reality 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 fears like that of a solar storm 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.049
 of large proportions that could 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.659
 destroy much of ours from our 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.560
 technology and leave the planet to 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.329
 dark 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 this is the discussion of scientists 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 this is all an elaborate fantasy 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.390
 said mobile sound astro biologist 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.159
 nasa research and media center 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.170
 but the truth is that many people are 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.270
 truly worried worried 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.280
 It's all an elaborate fantasy stated of 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 furniture on astro biologist of the center of 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 ames da nasa research 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 but the truth is that many people are 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.240
 truly 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.160
 the culprit of many of them write about 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.930
 this for the particular nasa fico 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.180
 concerned with young people who write 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.580
 to me they say they are terrified that they do not 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.920
 Can sleep eat some of them account 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 what he even considers a suicide 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.550
 I think it's a bad thing to be spreading 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.880
 rumors on the internet to scare 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.640
 children while the libero a supposed 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.340
 planet with irregular orbit that would take 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.680
 3 3 thousand years to complete a lap in 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 around the sun scientists clarify that 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.550
 if such a large object and exists 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.800
 was on a collision course with the land 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.110
 it would have been detected does not 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.090
 no sense since if he was there 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.950
 we could we would be 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.950
 accompanying its trajectory by a 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.480
 a decade or more and now he 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.190
 be the brightest object in the sky 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.140
 after the sun and the moon 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.730
 You can steal this diamond alone. 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.140
 just go out and look at the sky said 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 morrison 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.470
 already with regard to solar activity a 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.520
 question asked by one of the users 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.060
 surprised 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.190
 Then the physicist told me downtown adams. 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 marshall space flight 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.570
 according to rumors quoted by the Internet user 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.810
 nasa would have predicted that the sun 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.720
 blackout between 21 and 23 December 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.180
 there is nothing that we know in physics that 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.370
 allow the sun to turn off for three 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 days and then I called again answered 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.050
 without, however, stating that we are 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.930
 totally free from any danger 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.910
 the biggest threat to the earth in 2012 at the end 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.010
 this year and in the future comes from 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.690
 human species 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.910
 besides the internet meeting the nasa 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.310
 reissued on November 13 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 a special page on your site in 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.720
 internet that answers some of the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.560
 questions and fears about the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.390
 end of the world 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.360
 in the air since 2009 the page received 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.480
 thousands of visitors will stay here in 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.220
 special page to highlight the page 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.550
 nasa page www.nasa.gov we have 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.800
 here then what then ends of the world 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.060
 here is the bending of the Mayan calendar book 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.390
 What's up here? 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.100
 then there are threats for until 2012 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.840
 many internet sites said that the 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.270
 world ends in December 2002 we're 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.680
 O here the origin of the magazine's 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.690
 prediction that the world 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.720
 in 2012 the story began with allegations 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.919
 that inhibits look at where the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.449
 information 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.910
 will at last Mayan calendar 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.889
 December 2012 but already predicting blackout 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.729
 total is everything that enters the site of 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.550
 nasa 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.340
 we will deal with on the ground with the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.930
 specialist than you are there 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.310
 listening to a lot of things I'm seeing 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.690
 people are passing the time competent 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.340
 entering every bullshit 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.630
 There are people stocking food. 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.419
 being the end of the world will come 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.410
 so much is the war in israel with the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.120
 Palestine 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.509
 had people make a video saying that the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.650
 golden dome and fall is that the IAVI 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:08.770
 now the antichrist who to erect the time 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.259
 from Jerusalem, I ask where are you from? 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.419
 predictions that were then made more 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.130
 careful but hey you 're listening is this 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.590
 here you are listening to this 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.900
 I have more precautions with that. 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.729
 that you have come online does not 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.960
 swallow anything I will not come back 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.960
 talk again 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.210
 I'm not looking for any more ground 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.830
 is not just theory does not look to 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.530
 foundations that can corroborate the 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.570
 not those sick people who 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.970
 are on the internet as you have just 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.699
 read and listen to what I just mentioned 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.919
 here people contemplating suicide that 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.080
 it does not have a little more say one 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.940
 A little more careful people and ignore 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.070
 these people are making predictions 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.449
 apocalyptic and all this here take 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.490
 be carefull that's right 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.490
 a successful embrace that is even more lethal
