00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
talked about how to remove it I'm

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.979

supposed<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.000> put<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:45.809> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
supposed to put it on because it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.330 
supposed to put it on because it's
pretty<00:00:46.140> simple<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.950> stick<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pretty simple all you do is stick it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
pretty simple all you do is stick it
down<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.300> mentioned<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.050> reusable

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
down as I mentioned it has this reusable

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
down as I mentioned it has this reusable
adhesive<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.309> you'll<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.989> activate<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
adhesive so you'll actually activate it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
adhesive so you'll actually activate it
again<00:00:52.230> under<00:00:52.829> water<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> plan<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.180> or

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
again under water if you plan on or

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
again under water if you plan on or
using<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.590> instructions<00:00:55.890> talked<00:00:56.430> about

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
using it the instructions talked about

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
using it the instructions talked about
how<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> remove<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> really

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
how to remove it because it is really

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
how to remove it because it is really
strong<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.309> careful<00:00:59.579> when<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
strong so you got to be careful when you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
strong so you got to be careful when you
take<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.309> damage

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
take this off so that you don't damage

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
take this off so that you don't damage
your<00:01:02.940> device<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.570> won't<00:01:03.750> leave<00:01:03.870> any<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
your device it won't leave any kind of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
your device it won't leave any kind of
residue<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.890> anything<00:01:05.159> behind<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:06.090> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
residue or anything behind it's just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.580 
residue or anything behind it's just
that<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.750> strong<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> feels<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that it's so strong that it feels like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
that it's so strong that it feels like
it's<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.799> pull<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.340> device<00:01:08.580> apart<00:01:08.970> I'm

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
it's gonna pull your device apart I'm
struggling<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> try<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> backing<00:01:11.189> off

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
struggling to try to get the backing off

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.630 
struggling to try to get the backing off
that<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.760> put<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.369> there<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.520> go

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that I put back on here and there we go

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
that I put back on here and there we go
I<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.710> said<00:01:16.920> it's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I got it now just got it as I said it's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
I got it now just got it as I said it's
it's<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.580> strong<00:01:17.820> adhesive<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.479> there

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's a really strong adhesive so there

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's a really strong adhesive so there
it's<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.619> once<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> expose<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> adhesive

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it's off so once you expose the adhesive

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's off so once you expose the adhesive
you<00:01:21.180> essentially<00:01:21.659> find<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> center<00:01:22.619> point<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you essentially find the center point of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
you essentially find the center point of
your<00:01:23.189> phone<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.820> tablet<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.200> stick

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
your phone or tablet and you just stick

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
your phone or tablet and you just stick
it<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> locks<00:01:27.299> in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it down like so and then it locks in

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
it down like so and then it locks in
place<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.200> strong<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
place it's really strong like I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
place it's really strong like I
mentioned<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> come<00:01:30.420> off

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
mentioned it's not going to come off

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
mentioned it's not going to come off
unless<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> pry<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.610> then

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
unless you want to pry it off and then

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
unless you want to pry it off and then
like<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.970> said<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.509> save<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.439> backing

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like I said you can save that backing

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
like I said you can save that backing
put<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.850> reactivate<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
put it back on and then reactivate it so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.649 
put it back on and then reactivate it so
