 esselle sta. for only ester power to indicate the construction next to body with 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.599
 a maple neck 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 passing through two alder wings 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.589
 is going to indicate the fact that the archtop guitars with the top 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.700
 slightly domed slightly, because I am not too curved 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.940
 nice for now 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940
 has the support of the right hand 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.090
 e7 because it is a 7-string version 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 also exists naturally in the 6-string version, however, this night currently the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.780
 top model in the jakson classroom for 7-string guitars 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.930
 standard tuning therefore comunas normal memory +10 low 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.120
 the standard equipment includes the original floyd rose bridge

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.299
 the main feature of the jakson handles or the compound keyboard 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.160
 radius 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.610
 radioso compound means variable radius of curvature 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.580
 12-inch for the first octave if 16 inches of the second set comes 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 this because 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.950
 because the slightly more curved keyboard never wins however 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.600
 slightly more curved helps the chords in the first eighth to bake knits 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.320
 help me fast snout 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.840
 while in the second octave where the keyboard is needed it becomes flatter for 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.750
 allow us lower mace 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.540
 and banking and always in tune without the risk that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.340
 let them create phantom notes or what level fades. on the sofa 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 this is the typical characteristic quarry 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.950
 of jakson keyboards put some keyboards on jackson guitars 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 extremely playable from the very first approach of course in one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.560
 study so important 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.509
 which requires extreme versatility with regards to non-instrumentation 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.579
 a more stratocaster night may be missing 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.089
 in this case we have probably the most beautiful specimens of the last 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.009
 years 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:22.079
 mary key stratocaster model of the cast on ciotto realized in 2005 is 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.129
 a master guitar, 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.900
 it is an extremely accurate re-edition the finish is a handicap but I love those 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.569
 that is not excessive 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.650
 if of punishment 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.610
 some draft on the snow on the beautiful body in ash-colored sea with finish 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.139
 transparent white 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.989
 It is true that nature is very beautiful 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.229
 and it's a lard guitar i'm very hot 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.709
 even from the ex I am extremely comfortable and comfortable 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.439
 not always easy 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.989
 find it on standard instruments 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.510
 and that you clearly notice its origin as a cent photo tool
