00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
no it's called dil kabaddi because the
idea<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.060> love<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.750> relationships

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
idea is that like love and relationships

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.480 
idea is that like love and relationships
are<00:01:55.590> again<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
are again and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.120 
are again and
you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:57.020> there's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> tussle<00:01:58.439> involved<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you know there's a tussle involved and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
you know there's a tussle involved and
and<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.570> essentially<00:02:00.930> suppose<00:02:01.200> be

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and it's just essentially suppose be

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.359 
and it's just essentially suppose be
light-hearted<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.860> characters<00:02:02.250> are

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
light-hearted the characters are

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.429 
light-hearted the characters are
slightly<00:02:02.610> exaggerated<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.840> completely<00:02:04.320> true

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
slightly exaggerated not completely true

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.530 
slightly exaggerated not completely true
to<00:02:04.590> life<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.130> again<00:02:05.280> people<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.030> relate<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to life but again people will relate to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.999 
to life but again people will relate to
it<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.899> essentially<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.560> people<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.890> love

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it but essentially one people to love

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
it but essentially one people to love
yeah<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> best<00:02:10.200> way<00:02:10.380> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
yeah I think that's the best way of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.740 
yeah I think that's the best way of
dealing<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.640> say<00:02:11.819> love<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
dealing with it they say love is the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.570 
dealing with it they say love is the
best<00:02:12.780> medicine<00:02:13.230> yeah<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.040> plus<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
best medicine yeah and plus when you
