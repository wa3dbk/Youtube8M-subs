interesting software tweaks and low low

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.500 
interesting software tweaks and low low
prices<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.340> let's<00:00:17.520> start<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:17.940> by<00:00:17.970> taking<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
prices so let's start off by taking a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.910 
prices so let's start off by taking a
look<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> actual<00:00:19.230> hardware<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.830> we'll

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
look at the actual hardware and we'll

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.050 
look at the actual hardware and we'll
begin<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> Swift<00:00:20.640> which<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
begin with the Swift which is the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.970 
begin with the Swift which is the
smaller<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> two<00:00:21.689> phones<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
smaller of the two phones so this is a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.580 
smaller of the two phones so this is a
5-inch<00:00:23.640> display<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.420> 4G<00:00:24.960> onboard

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
5-inch display it's got 4G onboard

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
5-inch display it's got 4G onboard
that's<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> 13<00:00:26.490> megapixel<00:00:27.269> camera<00:00:27.300> around<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that's a 13 megapixel camera around the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.390 
that's a 13 megapixel camera around the
back<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> front<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.039> 5

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
back and on the front that's a 5

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.849 
back and on the front that's a 5
megapixel<00:00:29.789> snapper<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.900> Swift<00:00:31.140> has<00:00:31.289> 16

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
megapixel snapper the Swift has 16

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.110 
megapixel snapper the Swift has 16
gigabytes<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> storage<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
gigabytes of storage which you can

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 
gigabytes of storage which you can
backup<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> micro<00:00:34.050> SD<00:00:34.350> card<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
backup with a micro SD card now the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
backup with a micro SD card now the
storm<00:00:35.850> doesn't<00:00:36.360> look<00:00:36.600> too<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
storm doesn't look too different but it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.260 
storm doesn't look too different but it
does<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.620> slightly<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.280> fancy<00:00:39.090> hardware

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
does have slightly more fancy hardware

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660 
does have slightly more fancy hardware
so<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> 5.5<00:00:40.680> inch<00:00:40.710> display<00:00:41.010> instead<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so that's a 5.5 inch display instead of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
so that's a 5.5 inch display instead of
5-inch<00:00:42.210> there's<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> 20<00:00:43.350> megapixel<00:00:43.890> camera

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
5-inch there's got a 20 megapixel camera

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
5-inch there's got a 20 megapixel camera
8<00:00:44.610> megapixel<00:00:45.300> camera<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> front<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
8 megapixel camera on the front and it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.709 
8 megapixel camera on the front and it's
got<00:00:46.530> 32<00:00:47.129> gigabytes<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> on-board<00:00:47.879> storage<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
got 32 gigabytes of on-board storage you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
got 32 gigabytes of on-board storage you
can<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:49.020> bulk<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> microSD

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
can also bulk that up with a microSD

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
can also bulk that up with a microSD
card<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.000> enough<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.199> move<00:00:52.320> on

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
card if it's not enough so let's move on

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.779 
card if it's not enough so let's move on
to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> software<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.579> where

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to the software because that's where

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
to the software because that's where
both<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> these<00:00:54.300> phones<00:00:54.539> gets<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> little<00:00:55.260> more

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
both of these phones gets a little more

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.590 
both of these phones gets a little more
interesting<00:00:56.430> they're<00:00:56.610> running<00:00:56.879> cyanogen

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
interesting they're running cyanogen

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
interesting they're running cyanogen
12.1<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> based<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.820> android<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.449> does

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
12.1 which is based on android but does

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
12.1 which is based on android but does
offer<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> few<00:01:01.289> extra<00:01:01.770> tweaks<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.699> instance

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
offer a few extra tweaks for instance

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.920 
offer a few extra tweaks for instance
there<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.300> interesting<00:01:03.780> security

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
there are some interesting security

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
there are some interesting security
features<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.040> things<00:01:05.189> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
features you can do things like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
features you can do things like
permanently<00:01:06.000> blocked<00:01:06.299> numbers<00:01:06.689> these<00:01:07.170> phones

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
permanently blocked numbers these phones

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
permanently blocked numbers these phones
will<00:01:07.590> supposedly<00:01:07.920> identify<00:01:08.760> spam<00:01:09.150> callers

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
will supposedly identify spam callers

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
will supposedly identify spam callers
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:10.260> scramble<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.280> passcode<00:01:12.090> lock

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you can also scramble your passcode lock

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
you can also scramble your passcode lock
so<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> numbers<00:01:12.900> always<00:01:13.049> appear<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
so the numbers always appear in a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.260 
so the numbers always appear in a
different<00:01:13.920> randomized<00:01:14.580> place<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.000> foil

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
different randomized place to foil

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
different randomized place to foil
people<00:01:15.630> looking<00:01:15.900> over<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.229> shoulder<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
people looking over your shoulder and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
people looking over your shoulder and
you<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:17.909> detailed<00:01:18.299> control<00:01:19.049> over

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you get very very detailed control over

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
you get very very detailed control over
what<00:01:19.890> information<00:01:20.850> every<00:01:21.240> different<00:01:21.509> app<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what information every different app can

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
what information every different app can
access<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.100> cameras<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.520> slow<00:01:23.880> motion

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
access the cameras have slow motion

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
access the cameras have slow motion
video<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> quite<00:01:25.080> interesting<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
video which is quite interesting and one

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.080 
video which is quite interesting and one
thing<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
thing I really like is that you can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
thing I really like is that you can
customize<00:01:27.299> these<00:01:27.869> navigation<00:01:28.560> buttons<00:01:28.829> along

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
customize these navigation buttons along

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
customize these navigation buttons along
the<00:01:29.100> bottom<00:01:29.430> also<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> bunch<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> EQ

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the bottom also you get a bunch of EQ

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
the bottom also you get a bunch of EQ
presets<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> tinker<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
presets if you want to tinker with the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
presets if you want to tinker with the
built-in<00:01:33.990> sound<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.250> let's<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.579> onto<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
built-in sound so let's get onto that
