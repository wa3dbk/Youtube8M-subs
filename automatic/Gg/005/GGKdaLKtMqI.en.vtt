00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
hair into a top and bottom hat and I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.839 
hair into a top and bottom hat and I
love<00:00:10.769> doing<00:00:11.040> updos<00:00:11.370> there's<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.759> many

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
love doing updos there's so many

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.450 
love doing updos there's so many
different<00:00:12.330> variations<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.320> them<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> most<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
different variations to them and most of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.980 
different variations to them and most of
the<00:00:14.519> ones<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.210> pretty<00:00:15.480> easy<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the ones that I do are pretty easy and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
the ones that I do are pretty easy and
you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.170> either<00:00:16.260> adjust<00:00:16.410> them<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.430> down

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
you can either adjust them up or down

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.599 
you can either adjust them up or down
so<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.230> gonna<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.800> turn<00:00:20.010> around<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so what I'm gonna do is turn around and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.460 
so what I'm gonna do is turn around and
in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> bottom<00:00:21.270> half<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.750> hair<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.199> going

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
in the bottom half of my hair I'm going

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.640 
in the bottom half of my hair I'm going
to<00:00:22.560> section<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:23.310> four<00:00:23.699> pieces<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.810> tie<00:00:25.380> them

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
to section into four pieces and tie them

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
to section into four pieces and tie them
in<00:00:25.830> about<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> middle<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.789> head<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.359> four

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
in about the middle of my head with four

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.330 
in about the middle of my head with four
small<00:00:28.500> elastics<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> really

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
small elastics so if you have a really

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.950 
small elastics so if you have a really
thin<00:00:32.520> hair<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> might<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.300> three<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
thin hair you might use three but I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.680 
thin hair you might use three but I
think<00:00:34.200> four<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.920> pretty<00:00:35.790> good<00:00:36.059> number<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
think four is a pretty good number for

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.240 
think four is a pretty good number for
this<00:00:37.460> I'm<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.640> gonna<00:00:38.760> section<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.690> off

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.520 

those<00:00:45.940> can<00:00:46.330> speed<00:00:46.630> it<00:00:46.660> up<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.960> little<00:00:46.990> bit<00:00:47.290> for

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
those can speed it up a little bit for

00:00:47.530 --> 00:01:04.060 
those can speed it up a little bit for
you<00:00:47.680> guys

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.260 

and<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.339> actually<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.000> easy

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and this is actually the really easy

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.030 
and this is actually the really easy
part<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.810> gonna<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> loop<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.860> your

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
part you're gonna make a loop with your

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.030 
part you're gonna make a loop with your
fingers<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:10.200> gonna<00:01:10.320> bobby<00:01:10.650> pin

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
fingers and you're gonna bobby pin

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
fingers and you're gonna bobby pin
inside<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.119> loop<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.770> gonna

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
inside that loop and then you're gonna

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
inside that loop and then you're gonna
have<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.400> hair<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.840> you're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have all this hair left over then you're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.210 
have all this hair left over then you're
just<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.140> keep<00:01:16.380> wrapping<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> hair<00:01:17.100> around

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
just gonna keep wrapping the hair around

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
just gonna keep wrapping the hair around
itself<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.300> just<00:01:18.540> makes<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.140> 2<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.530> 3

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
itself so it just makes like 2 or 3

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850 
itself so it just makes like 2 or 3
loops<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> middle<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
loops and then you're in the middle of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
loops and then you're in the middle of
that<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.550> just<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> pin<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that you're just going to pin it in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
that you're just going to pin it in
place<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:26.280> need<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.610> eight<00:01:26.880> bobby<00:01:27.210> pins

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
place so you need about eight bobby pins

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
place so you need about eight bobby pins
for<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.440> if<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.920> pieces<00:01:29.340> stick<00:01:29.550> out

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
for this and if some pieces stick out

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.820 
for this and if some pieces stick out
that's<00:01:29.940> perfectly<00:01:30.509> fine<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.530> going

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
that's perfectly fine because it's going

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.859 
that's perfectly fine because it's going
to<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.369> covered<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to kind of be covered and this is a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
to kind of be covered and this is a
messy<00:01:34.380> look<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.580> do<00:01:35.940> want<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.300> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
messy look so if you do want to make it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
messy look so if you do want to make it
more<00:01:36.630> neat<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.440> just<00:01:37.830> bobby<00:01:38.369> pin<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more neat I was to just bobby pin it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
more neat I was to just bobby pin it
Bobby<00:01:39.390> pinning<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.200> securely<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Bobby pinning it more securely and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.279 
Bobby pinning it more securely and
making<00:01:41.550> sure<00:01:41.759> nothing<00:01:42.060> sticks<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.050> hair

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
making sure nothing sticks out and hair

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.370 
making sure nothing sticks out and hair
spraying<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:44.039> well<00:01:44.330> but<00:01:45.330> again<00:01:45.840> I'm

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
spraying it really well but again I'm

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
spraying it really well but again I'm
just<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.130> basically<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.789> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just gonna do it's basically just a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460 
just gonna do it's basically just a
bunch<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.390> loops<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.170> me<00:01:49.289> just

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
bunch of loops and you can see me just

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.650 
bunch of loops and you can see me just
wrapping<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.039> my<00:01:50.340> fingers<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.119> then

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
wrapping it around my fingers and then

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.419 
wrapping it around my fingers and then
in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> center<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.679> loop<00:01:52.830> I'm<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
in the center of the loop I'm going to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.029 
in the center of the loop I'm going to
bobby<00:01:53.789> pin<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.450> my<00:01:54.539> head<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.830> doing

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
bobby pin it to my head now I'm doing

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.650 
bobby pin it to my head now I'm doing
this<00:01:56.190> all<00:01:56.429> without<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> mirror<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.300> if<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.509> use

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
this all without a mirror so if you use

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.960 
this all without a mirror so if you use
a<00:01:57.690> mirror<00:01:58.050> it's<00:01:58.229> definitely<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.830> lot<00:01:59.130> easier<00:01:59.640> or

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
a mirror it's definitely a lot easier or

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.880 
a mirror it's definitely a lot easier or
if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.539> do<00:02:00.660> it<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> someone<00:02:01.200> else<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.590> even

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
if you do it on someone else is even

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
if you do it on someone else is even
easier<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.300> just<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> repeat<00:02:04.140> this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
easier so I'm just going to repeat this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
easier so I'm just going to repeat this
process<00:02:04.679> in<00:02:05.990> my<00:02:06.990> breaking<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.759> ponytail<00:02:08.759> into

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
process in my breaking the ponytail into

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.780 
process in my breaking the ponytail into
two<00:02:09.569> sections<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.709> kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.160> give<00:02:11.490> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
two sections it's gonna kind of give you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.839 
two sections it's gonna kind of give you
a<00:02:12.030> more<00:02:12.780> paluma<00:02:13.349> nough<00:02:13.590> stead<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.610> doing

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
a more paluma nough stead of just doing

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.809 
a more paluma nough stead of just doing
all<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.480> loops<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:16.020> top<00:02:16.550> I'm<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.700> gonna

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819
