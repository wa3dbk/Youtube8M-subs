question<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:11.160> does<00:00:11.309> anyone<00:00:11.490> know<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:12.059> mean<00:00:12.509> was

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
question how does anyone know I mean was

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360 
question how does anyone know I mean was
anybody<00:00:12.929> there<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.559> observe<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> well

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
anybody there to observe it well

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.620 
anybody there to observe it well
actually<00:00:14.580> somebody<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.420> getting

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
actually somebody was but I'm getting

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.180 
actually somebody was but I'm getting
ahead<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> myself<00:00:15.900> check<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.500> out<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:17.039> of

ahead of myself check this out first of
all<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.789> need<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> recognize<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
all we need to recognize that there is a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
all we need to recognize that there is a

observational science is simply when we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.140 
observational science is simply when we

observe something in experiment to draw
conclusions<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.199> involves<00:00:31.650> repeatable

conclusions it involves repeatable

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
present it's through observational

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
present it's through observational
science<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.840> find<00:00:37.050> cures<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.530> diseases

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
science that we find cures for diseases

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.470 
science that we find cures for diseases
and<00:00:38.190> build<00:00:38.430> space<00:00:38.700> shuttle's<00:00:39.059> stuff<00:00:39.329> like

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and build space shuttle's stuff like

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
and build space shuttle's stuff like
that<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:40.260> through<00:00:40.800> historical<00:00:41.430> science<00:00:41.760> we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that now through historical science we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
that now through historical science we
consider<00:00:42.690> things<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> happened<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
consider things that happened in the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.200 
consider things that happened in the
past<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.370> cannot<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.730> checked<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
past but they cannot be checked in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
past but they cannot be checked in the
same<00:00:45.420> way<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.829> access<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
same way I mean we don't have access to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.860 
same way I mean we don't have access to
the<00:00:47.550> past<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> present<00:00:48.600> because

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the past like we do the present because

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
the past like we do the present because
well<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.739> gone<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
well it's gone right well we really have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.810 
well it's gone right well we really have
a<00:00:51.420> speculation<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.500> best<00:00:52.820> circumstantial

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a speculation or at best circumstantial

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
a speculation or at best circumstantial
evidences<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.570> past<00:00:54.870> events<00:00:55.379> based<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.829> what

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
evidences of past events based on what

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.680 
evidences of past events based on what
we<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> present<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.570> say

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we see in the present that's not to say

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
we see in the present that's not to say
that<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.930> can't<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.320> intelligent<00:00:58.590> guesses

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that we can't make intelligent guesses

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
that we can't make intelligent guesses
about<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> past<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.329> form<00:01:00.660> reasonable

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
about the past or form reasonable

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
about the past or form reasonable
inferences<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:01.980> rocks<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.430> fossils<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
inferences from rocks or fossils in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
inferences from rocks or fossils in the
present<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.809> certainly<00:01:03.960> cannot<00:01:04.409> directly

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
present but we certainly cannot directly

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
present but we certainly cannot directly
test<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.430> conclusions<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.420> cannot

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
test our conclusions because we cannot

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.590 
test our conclusions because we cannot
repeat<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> past<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.939> does<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.420> mean

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
repeat the past got it so does that mean

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
repeat the past got it so does that mean
historical<00:01:10.170> science<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.560> unimportant<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.700> at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
historical science is unimportant not at

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.730 
historical science is unimportant not at
all<00:01:11.970> let's<00:01:12.420> drop<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.720> example<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.380> for

told<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> true<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.400> test<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
told you is true but how do we test it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
told you is true but how do we test it
well<00:01:33.689> applying<00:01:34.049> observational<00:01:34.890> science<00:01:35.250> we

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well applying observational science we

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
well applying observational science we
can<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> course<00:01:35.759> observe<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> Eiffel<00:01:37.020> Tower

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
can of course observe the Eiffel Tower

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
can of course observe the Eiffel Tower

so<00:02:20.770> does<00:02:21.160> observational<00:02:21.790> science<00:02:22.120> confirm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so does observational science confirm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.910 
so does observational science confirm
that<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> world<00:02:22.870> was<00:02:23.050> created<00:02:23.380> by<00:02:23.470> God<00:02:23.710> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that the world was created by God and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
that the world was created by God and
are<00:02:24.400> they're<00:02:24.550> trustworthy<00:02:24.940> documents<00:02:25.660> and

are they're trustworthy documents and
eyewitness<00:02:26.170> accounts<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> confirm<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.130> well
