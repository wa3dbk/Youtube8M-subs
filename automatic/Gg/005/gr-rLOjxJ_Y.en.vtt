other<00:00:25.070> seagate<00:00:26.070> freeagent<00:00:26.250> drive<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.119> only

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
other seagate freeagent drive the only

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.150 
other seagate freeagent drive the only
difference<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.470> flex<00:00:28.740> drive<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
difference is it's a go flex drive and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
difference is it's a go flex drive and
that's<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.399> new<00:00:32.610> branding<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.210> seagate<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> new

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that's a new branding from seagate a new

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
that's a new branding from seagate a new
ecosystem<00:00:34.230> from<00:00:34.800> them<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> they're<00:00:35.670> hoping

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ecosystem from them and they're hoping

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.709 
ecosystem from them and they're hoping
it'll<00:00:36.420> become<00:00:37.370> more<00:00:38.370> than<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.670> ecosystem<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it'll become more than an ecosystem with

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.130 
it'll become more than an ecosystem with
them<00:00:39.899> since<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.230> uses<00:00:40.410> standard<00:00:40.920> ports<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.700> i'm

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
them since it uses standard ports so i'm

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
them since it uses standard ports so i'm
going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.809> this<00:00:45.809> is

is a USB 2.0 you can buy this adapter

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.679 
is a USB 2.0 you can buy this adapter
and<00:01:01.550> turn<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.710> USB<00:01:04.710> 3.0<00:01:05.430> I've<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and turn it into a USB 3.0 I've or a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.590 
and turn it into a USB 3.0 I've or a
firewire<00:01:07.320> drive<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.299> an

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
firewire drive this one right here is an

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
firewire drive this one right here is an
adapter<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> convert<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> into<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> USB<00:01:11.280> 2.8

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
adapter to convert this into a USB 2.8

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.830 
adapter to convert this into a USB 2.8
came<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> system<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.630> buy

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
came with the system but you can buy

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740 
came with the system but you can buy
these<00:01:16.439> separately<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.580> USB<00:01:17.939> 3.0<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
these separately for USB 3.0 and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
these separately for USB 3.0 and
firewire<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.619> 2999<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.229> does<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
firewire for 2999 so what this does is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
firewire for 2999 so what this does is
that<00:01:23.610> allows<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> upgrade<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.810> hard

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that allows you to upgrade your hard

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.749 
that allows you to upgrade your hard
drive<00:01:25.229> without<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:26.280> having<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> buy<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
drive without actually having to buy a

drive without actually having to buy a
new<00:01:26.939> hard<00:01:27.180> drive<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> brand

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
new hard drive so say you get a brand

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
new hard drive so say you get a brand
new<00:01:29.729> computer<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.070> this

drive but your current computer only has

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.700 
drive but your current computer only has
USB<00:01:34.200> 2.0<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.060> spend<00:01:36.479> thirty<00:01:37.290> dollars

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
USB 2.0 you just spend thirty dollars

USB 2.0 you just spend thirty dollars
get<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.250> adapter<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.659> convert<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
get an adapter and you convert it into a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.730 
get an adapter and you convert it into a
USB<00:01:40.680> 3.0<00:01:41.369> drive<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.740> speed

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
USB 3.0 drive and you get that speed

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.389 
USB 3.0 drive and you get that speed
boost<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.310> comes<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.670> USB<00:01:44.939> 3.0<00:01:48.020> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
boost that comes with USB 3.0 the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.770 
boost that comes with USB 3.0 the
adapter<00:01:50.399> inside<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> basically<00:01:51.390> regular

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
adapter inside is basically regular

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
adapter inside is basically regular
regular<00:01:52.619> SATA<00:01:53.490> connector<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> SATA

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
regular SATA connector so it's the SATA

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
regular SATA connector so it's the SATA
for<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> data<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.860> goes<00:01:56.009> connected<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
for the data that goes connected to the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.770 
for the data that goes connected to the
motherboard<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.689> goes

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
motherboard and the one that goes

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310 
motherboard and the one that goes
connected<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.409> power<00:01:58.560> supply<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.390> for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
connected to your power supply so if for

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.719 
connected to your power supply so if for
any<00:02:01.469> reason<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.799> wanted<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> stick<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
any reason you wanted to stick this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.880 
any reason you wanted to stick this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
drive inside your desktop you could go

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
drive inside your desktop you could go
all<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.060> connect<00:02:06.479> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
all you would have to do is connect this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.180 
all you would have to do is connect this
to<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:08.239> SATA<00:02:09.239> cable<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> SATA<00:02:10.470> power<00:02:10.619> K<00:02:10.890> 1<00:02:11.069> it

to a SATA cable and a SATA power K 1 it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
to a SATA cable and a SATA power K 1 it
it<00:02:11.370> worked

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it worked

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.070 
it worked
