 fashionable in the 19th century bulging in the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.300

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.300
 in the forearm 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.220

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.369
 the closet and they have asked who

 Pongo MarÃ­a LeÃ³n solves this question 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.599
 He has been advising for four years

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.760

 book and have everything to do because donning

 heaven for me means having 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.540
 personality I think it is to adapt the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.059
 tendencies that there is to oneself that is not 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.930
 always follow strictly what is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.909
 it takes to have to act as if you were 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.949
 a fashion victim that you just have to 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.910
 have in the closet brand clothes or the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.230
 last trend, I'm not always very 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.019
 in favor of having your own your 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.300
 personality and stomp and have a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.160
 wardrobe that really with which you 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 feel identified weights for me 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.850
 style 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 there are 50 situations and then what I have 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.500
 fact is to create outfits for those 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 situations of 80 because the book has 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.270
 a lot of image for me was very 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 important to create a funny book 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.840
 energetically a little bit my spirit that's not 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.660
 what I transmit on my blog too 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 is that idea and I wanted the book that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.290
 was something similar is the diana has 32 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 years and is a graduate in science 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 environmental issues in the last year of the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.920
 career began its journey in the world 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.470
 of fashion and today is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.050
 considered the Spanish girl of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.570
 moment 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.360
 man given my work in fashion 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.420
 trends 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:56.100
 and I absorbed them the mental ones did the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 trends that exist every season 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.670
 the complements I 've always said that 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.550
 they are very important because like a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.349
 Salad without dressing is very bad a look 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.390
 without supplements because the same thing happens 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.140
 lacks life I think that the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.660
 complements are the point that gives you the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.910
 definition to a look not for example you 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.459
 You can wear a black dress that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.900
 has cost 20 euros of a market and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.800
 if you work well the add-ons that 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.019
 you wear with that dress you can really 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.760
 succeed I have a blog where 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.250
 I share with my followers 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.690
 diaries then it occurred to me that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.060
 could inspire the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.100
 readers of the book you can accompany a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.310
 photo that defined the style that I 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 I was explaining there are 50 I did them in 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.530
 two days 25 photos per day that any 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.900
 activist who works in fashion tells you 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.360
 that the most that can be done during 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.989
 One day there are about 8 photos because you have to 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.440
 change hair makeup 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.440
 Styling of all 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.840
