NAT the privateer mission this time it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
NAT the privateer mission this time it
is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.780> Seawolves<00:00:10.139> which<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.130> quite<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.550> this

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
is the Seawolves which I quite like this

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.180 
is the Seawolves which I quite like this
mission<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.440> basically<00:00:13.440> an<00:00:13.620> escort<00:00:14.040> mission

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
mission it's basically an escort mission

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.060 
mission it's basically an escort mission
something<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.900> proper<00:00:16.410> privateer

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
something it's like a proper privateer

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.480 
something it's like a proper privateer
solve<00:00:17.970> convoy<00:00:18.830> mission<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
solve convoy mission if you know what I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.090 
solve convoy mission if you know what I
mean<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> protect<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:22.020> 12<00:00:22.529> ships<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
mean we have to protect about 12 ships I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.060 
mean we have to protect about 12 ships I
think<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.550> four<00:00:23.939> tickets<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
think from four tickets so the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.070 
think from four tickets so the
medium-sized<00:00:26.760> ships<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> sync

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
medium-sized ships which we need to sync

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.250 
medium-sized ships which we need to sync
and<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:32.550> full<00:00:32.910> synchronization<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.809> need<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and for full synchronization we need to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160 
and for full synchronization we need to
complete<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.370> mission<00:00:35.430> without<00:00:36.170> losing

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
complete this mission without losing

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
only lost to casual too friendly ships

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.340 
only lost to casual too friendly ships
two<00:03:34.290> casualties<00:03:34.710> slow<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.110> three

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
two casualties slow you can have three

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.530 
two casualties slow you can have three
Bartok<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.770> fourth<00:03:38.070> one<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.550> know<00:03:38.790> fails<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
Bartok the fourth one you know fails the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.530 
Bartok the fourth one you know fails the
objective<00:03:40.020> so<00:03:43.760> we<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.910> have<00:03:45.030> three<00:03:45.270> friend

the ship sink and then we fail the
objectives<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.500> they'll<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.550> mission

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
objectives so they'll go mission
