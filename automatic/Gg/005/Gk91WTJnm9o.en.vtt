00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
not in the previous video if you watch

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.100 
not in the previous video if you watch

you can put the egg in then look in

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.860 
you can put the egg in then look in
there<00:01:51.350> but<00:01:51.620> a<00:01:51.650> bit<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.860> salt<00:01:52.130> stir<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.730> around

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.090 
there but a bit of salt stir it around
or<00:01:53.870> you<00:01:53.960> get<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.470> your<00:01:54.500> ear<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.010> then
