 fast economic and good what most 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 important to do it from the heart and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 nothing good pro that you please and so 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 keep watching 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.850
 the ingredients as we said before 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.820
 They are in puff pastry and cream 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.119
 chocolate in castilla nutella what 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.119
 have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.579
 well let's start the recipe this is 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.930
 super simple super super simple what 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.970
 first thing we're going to do is take a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.200
 a kind of small mold as if 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 out of pizza 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.830
 well round when I could too 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.460
 do square but we will be left with 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.350
 the same way then we take the mold 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.030
 and we put a paper of a vegetal paper 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.320
 so that our mass does not stick to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.450
 mold 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 I remembered it like that in a circle 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.090
 easier and good we put the dough the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.860
 mass square the one that I have then 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.690
 we have to cut the edges 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.720
 We cut one of the corners 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 we put aside what is missing and so 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 successively with the corners that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 missing 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.600
 Well, nothing like that, you see 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.270
 when we have our puff pastry 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.510
 ready with its round shape 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.460
 we take our chocolate cream and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.720
 we are going to spread it all over 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.730
 the whole base of the puff pastry dough 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.290
 that is going that stays a hole no 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.570
 nothing happens but it is quite 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.360
 homogeneous and that does not get a very 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 fine that is a consistent layer go 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.770
 now we take the other puff pastry and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.350
 we spread it on top of our beyond 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.770
 with the nutella good with nutella what 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.750
 that you have and that we put it on top of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.750
 we crush it but as it knows 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.730
 churra la nocilla for the sides and then 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.250
 we simply do the same as with the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.260
 first we cut the edges and those 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.390
 surplus triangles because we put them 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.180
 in the holes the rest that do not 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.150
 use when filling the gap not the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.300
 you have to then we're going to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.990
 use what we are doing now and 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.720
 are partitions like rooms without getting 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.690
 to the center and then as a state but 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.630
 arriving a little less from the center a 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.490
 little less than the line of the rooms 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.950
 when we have that we turn towards 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.400
 in the two eighths that are in a 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.400
 quarter 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.870
 now we take the remaining 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.599
 the same as in a ball what 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.670
 we knead and as you can see we take a mold 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.269
 good the mold that you want as it is for 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.019
 Valentine's Day 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.780
 I eat a mold like that 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.819
 we press and the fort fort does not come out 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.150
 of puff pastry in the form of 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.150
 heart 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.190
 and that's what we do with that, what 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.720
 we put in the center of our flower 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.230
 puff pastry 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.410
 but first so that in some way 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.290
 adhere to the base we put a little 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.350
 of our chocolate cream and already 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.100
 we put on the little heart and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.590
 we press a little 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:44.440
 so that the kneading remains by the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.590
 outside as dry we put a 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.710
 little egg 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.870
 of egg yolk so that when 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.890
 Bake that fits as well as a shine 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.940
 the oven is not much nicer 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.250
 we preheat to 190 degrees and what 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.400
 let's have the dessert got baked 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.780
 are going to be 12 to 10 minutes is done 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.780
 what's going on is super fast 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.460
