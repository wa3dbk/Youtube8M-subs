00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
them in anyway and what you do is lay up

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.220 
them in anyway and what you do is lay up
all<00:00:19.279> in<00:00:20.279> either<00:00:20.460> side<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.939> open<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:21.990> so

all in either side of it open them up so
you've<00:00:22.380> got<00:00:22.529> three<00:00:22.769> balls<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.430> roughly<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you've got three balls and roughly the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.470 
you've got three balls and roughly the
same<00:00:24.330> gap<00:00:24.630> between<00:00:24.810> each<00:00:25.050> okay<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.359> lot<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
same gap between each okay a lot you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
same gap between each okay a lot you
guys<00:00:27.660> can't<00:00:28.289> seem<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> quite<00:00:28.859> grasp<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
guys can't seem to quite grasp how to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.299 
guys can't seem to quite grasp how to
close<00:00:29.880> through<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> bottom<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> ball<00:00:30.810> or

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
close through the bottom of the ball or

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.260 
close through the bottom of the ball or
where<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> through<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> bottom<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
where like through the bottom of the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.180 
where like through the bottom of the
balls<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.719> I'll<00:00:34.050> try<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
balls or I'll try and show this to you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.619 
balls or I'll try and show this to you
again<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:36.300> you're<00:00:37.110> looking<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.590> things<00:00:38.629> with

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
again if you're looking at things with

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.380 
again if you're looking at things with
bottom<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:41.100> must<00:00:41.370> go<00:00:41.520> through<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.879> bottom<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
bottom you must go through the bottom of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
bottom you must go through the bottom of
the<00:00:42.480> cuticle<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> approximately<00:00:43.559> there

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the cuticle which is approximately there

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
the cuticle which is approximately there
it's<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.879> tipple<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.809> below

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it's better a tipple or more below

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
it's better a tipple or more below
Center<00:00:46.469> okay<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
Center okay so go right down at the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
Center okay so go right down at the
bottom<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> ball<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.440> start<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
bottom of the ball to start with as you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
bottom of the ball to start with as you
get<00:00:50.910> better<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> lower<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.410> some

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
get better you can go lower but some

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
get better you can go lower but some
spots<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> tip<00:00:54.600> below<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> center<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
spots just a tip below the center and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
spots just a tip below the center and
you<00:00:56.190> must<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.579> right<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.210> through<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you must go right the way through the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
you must go right the way through the
hole<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> angle<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> cube

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
hole at that angle and so the cube

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
hole at that angle and so the cube
virtually<00:01:00.059> touches<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> cloth<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> my

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
virtually touches the cloth now my

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
virtually touches the cloth now my
advice<00:01:02.640> would<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> actually<00:01:03.539> play

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
advice would be that you actually play

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
advice would be that you actually play
that<00:01:04.049> shot<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.409> hold<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.010> merit<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.339> front

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that shot on hold for two merit in front

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.950 
that shot on hold for two merit in front
of<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.090> make<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> played<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of you to make sure that you played a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
of you to make sure that you played a
short<00:01:07.200> correctly<00:01:08.210> because<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.659> what

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
short correctly because I think what

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
short correctly because I think what
some<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.290> doing<00:01:10.340> instead<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> hitting

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
some of you are doing instead of hitting

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
some of you are doing instead of hitting
the<00:01:11.850> bottom<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> ball<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> way<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the bottom of the ball in the way that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.899 
the bottom of the ball in the way that
we<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.040> doing<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.400> instead<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
we think we're doing it instead of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
we think we're doing it instead of
staying<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.780> low<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.259> way

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
staying right down low all the way

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
staying right down low all the way
through<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:17.700> lifting<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
through it I think you're lifting the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.749 
through it I think you're lifting the
bus<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> push<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> button<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
bus so if you push down on the button it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280 
bus so if you push down on the button it
becomes<00:01:20.850> look<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.930> other<00:01:22.080> tips

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
becomes look at that see other tips

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770 
becomes look at that see other tips
coming<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> Q<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:24.030> C<00:01:24.330> soaring

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
coming up so the Q is actually C soaring

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
coming up so the Q is actually C soaring
on<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.049> hand<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.710> bridge<00:01:25.920> home<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> if

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
on your hand on your bridge home so if

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
on your hand on your bridge home so if
you<00:01:27.750> hold<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.560> front<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> when

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you hold it to out in front of you when

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
you hold it to out in front of you when
you<00:01:29.159> finish<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> stroke<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.420> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you finish the stroke it should be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.350 
you finish the stroke it should be
pointing<00:01:30.900> downwards<00:01:31.970> slightly<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.180> than

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
pointing downwards slightly more than

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.679 
pointing downwards slightly more than
where<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> started<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> mean

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
where you started if you see what I mean

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.060
