you

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.530 

that<00:00:05.089> marketing<00:00:05.600> has<00:00:05.720> lost<00:00:05.960> power<00:00:06.729> to<00:00:07.729> the<00:00:08.090> the

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
that marketing has lost power to the the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.270 
that marketing has lost power to the the
financial<00:00:09.110> function<00:00:09.650> you<00:00:09.709> look<00:00:09.860> at<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.070> foot

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
financial function you look at the foot

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.699 
financial function you look at the foot
see<00:00:10.430> one<00:00:10.610> hundred<00:00:11.000> fifty<00:00:11.600> percent<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:12.349> think<00:00:12.619> of

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
see one hundred fifty percent I think of

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.330 
see one hundred fifty percent I think of
the<00:00:12.799> CEOs<00:00:13.340> are<00:00:13.670> X<00:00:14.119> CFO's<00:00:14.600> like<00:00:14.900> me<00:00:15.109> do<00:00:16.039> I<00:00:16.070> think

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
the CEOs are X CFO's like me do I think

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.420 
the CEOs are X CFO's like me do I think
that's<00:00:16.520> a<00:00:16.670> bad<00:00:16.850> thing<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:18.189> think<00:00:19.189> it<00:00:19.279> makes

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
that's a bad thing I think it makes

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.180 
that's a bad thing I think it makes
people<00:00:19.640> focus<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:20.269> the<00:00:20.330> cost<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:21.530> way<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:21.770> win

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
people focus on the cost the way you win

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.060 
people focus on the cost the way you win
is<00:00:22.460> by<00:00:22.820> growing<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.270> top<00:00:23.480> line<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:24.830> think

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
is by growing the top line and I think

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.220 
is by growing the top line and I think
that<00:00:25.250> is<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.460> big<00:00:25.760> issue<00:00:25.850> is<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.330> finite<00:00:26.869> limit

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
that is the big issue is a finite limit

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.410 
that is the big issue is a finite limit
to<00:00:27.320> what<00:00:27.440> you<00:00:27.470> can<00:00:27.619> do<00:00:27.830> on<00:00:27.949> cost<00:00:28.270> so<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.300> think

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
to what you can do on cost so I think

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.210 
to what you can do on cost so I think
that's<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.110> centrally<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:30.830> know<00:00:31.039> if<00:00:31.130> you

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's the centrally and you know if you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.580 
that's the centrally and you know if you
ask<00:00:31.400> me<00:00:31.550> what<00:00:31.730> keeps<00:00:32.059> me<00:00:32.300> awake<00:00:32.570> at<00:00:32.599> night<00:00:32.750> it's

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
ask me what keeps me awake at night it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.670 
ask me what keeps me awake at night it's
that<00:00:33.859> it's<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.820> pressure<00:00:35.359> in<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:36.289> system

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
that it's that pressure in the system

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.190 
that it's that pressure in the system
and<00:00:36.980> that's<00:00:37.310> forcing<00:00:37.760> us<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.270> do<00:00:39.050> also

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
and that's forcing us to do also

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.840 
and that's forcing us to do also
something<00:00:39.560> it's<00:00:39.770> forcing<00:00:40.130> us<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.280> do<00:00:40.550> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
something it's forcing us to do the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
men it's for its forcing us i think to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.250 
men it's for its forcing us i think to
think<00:00:58.760> about<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.239> business<00:00:59.480> in<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.960> very

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
think about the business in a very

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.770 
think about the business in a very
different<00:01:00.530> way<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:00.980> can<00:01:01.219> reflects<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.940> i<00:01:04.780> used

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
different way and can reflects it i used

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.060 
different way and can reflects it i used
to<00:01:05.930> do<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.619> many<00:01:06.740> things<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:08.260> i<00:01:09.260> was<00:01:09.650> into<00:01:09.920> at

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
to do so many things that i was into at

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.649 
to do so many things that i was into at
the<00:01:10.190> time<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:10.729> maybe<00:01:10.909> they<00:01:11.210> didn't<00:01:11.510> make

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
the time but maybe they didn't make

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.080 
the time but maybe they didn't make
sense<00:01:11.930> for<00:01:12.320> my<00:01:12.470> brand<00:01:12.770> just<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.490> everything

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
sense for my brand just and everything

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.359 
sense for my brand just and everything
and<00:01:14.240> anything<00:01:14.360> was<00:01:14.840> exciting<00:01:15.350> for<00:01:15.380> me<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.070> i

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
and anything was exciting for me and i

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.700 
and anything was exciting for me and i
think<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.670> was<00:01:16.790> overkill<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.630> i<00:01:18.200> think

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.390 

I'm<00:01:21.520> glad<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.479> was<00:01:22.780> put<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.619> position<00:01:23.650> to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
I'm glad that I was put in a position to

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
I'm glad that I was put in a position to
where<00:01:24.549> I<00:01:24.850> just<00:01:25.390> wanted<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.750> take<00:01:25.930> time<00:01:26.200> off<00:01:26.260> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
where I just wanted to take time off and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.649 
where I just wanted to take time off and
figure<00:01:28.900> out<00:01:28.960> what<00:01:29.320> my<00:01:29.470> brand<00:01:29.710> was<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.360> think

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
figure out what my brand was and I think

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.649 
figure out what my brand was and I think
you<00:01:31.900> know<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.050> think<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.300> obviously<00:01:34.300> if

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
you know I think it's so obviously if

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.450 
you know I think it's so obviously if
you<00:01:34.900> have

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
you have

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.520 
you have
you<00:01:37.000> know<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.120> celebrity<00:01:37.420> endorsement<00:01:38.290> that's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
you know a celebrity endorsement that's

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.510 
you know a celebrity endorsement that's
like<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.830> huge<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:41.380> could<00:01:41.590> be<00:01:41.680> huge<00:01:41.950> for<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.220> brand

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
like a huge it could be huge for a brand

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.880 
like a huge it could be huge for a brand
but<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.540> has<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.750> be<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.140> right<00:01:44.170> person<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
but it has to be the right person in the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.870 
but it has to be the right person in the
right<00:01:44.979> partnership<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.810> think<00:01:47.080> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
right partnership and I think that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520 
right partnership and I think that
because<00:01:48.880> i<00:01:48.909> know<00:01:49.060> i<00:01:49.210> did<00:01:49.330> it<00:01:49.690> i<00:01:49.840> felt<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.290> i

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
because i know i did it i felt like i

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.640 
because i know i did it i felt like i
just<00:01:50.830> took<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.000> many<00:01:52.119> things<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.869> then<00:01:53.500> not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
just took on so many things and then not

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.590 
just took on so many things and then not
everything<00:01:54.220> was<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.550> right<00:01:54.700> fit<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.210> if<00:01:55.450> you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
everything was the right fit and if you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.469 
everything was the right fit and if you
do<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.930> too<00:01:56.170> much<00:01:56.350> i<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:58.149> could<00:01:58.360> also

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
do that too much i think it could also

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.680 
do that too much i think it could also
kill<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.930> brand<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.310> think<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:01.149> partnership

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
kill a brand so I think the partnership

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.249 
kill a brand so I think the partnership
just<00:02:01.869> has<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> be<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.530> real<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:02.830> so<00:02:03.070> authentic

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.290 

has<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.399> some<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.820> these<00:02:09.940> shows
