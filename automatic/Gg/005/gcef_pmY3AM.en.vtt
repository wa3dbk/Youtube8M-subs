00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.500
 Today I come with you delicious 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.379
 bean stew that actually works 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.529
 not much different than the vegetable broth 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.480
 vegetable soup but the special feature is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.000
 that I still have my side today 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.520
 a little bit, and then you will 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.260
 it is very strong spice so 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.640
 stay tuned and watch and cook 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 Here are some things for turn on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 I will use and start 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 just with my soup greens that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.250
 I also think of the bean stew I 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 do not orientate me on that now 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 classic bean stew weight 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.050
 but, as is often the case, with its own style 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.050
 do 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.390
 monster mainz the celery small 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.390
 to cut 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.809
 Of course apart 

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:27.810
 in the run especially back here that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:30.020
 Of course, green tea is not allowed either 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020
 absence 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.789
 I have an extra shooter now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.219
 because that's the same as before 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.560
 it is still seared at the beginning 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.289
 really nice so the taste 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.539
 the butter gives off and the rest more 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:54.479
 ingredients my bean stew and 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.450
 potatoes I think is fit 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.700
 best you can but just like that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.700
 give a lot or even rice 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.600
 In addition , there is a dose for me 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.780
 I already have white giant beans 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.910
 live reprinted residents dose quail 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.770
 I also drained you can 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.910
 since any resident somehow take that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.410
 gets and also has the desire then becomes 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.680
 also read a bit further 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.100
 this is because there namely a beautiful 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.100
 bliss 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.900
 So now I can give my name 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:53.570
 but also wonderful oil take that for 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:55.459
 that works well and resists 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.300
 Melt a bit and then mine 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.650
 son then has to ask for one 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.650
 lonely melts beautiful 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.130
 and then then for the crowd everything 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.760
 shines and that's where I'm talking now 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.510
 fry a few minutes so that 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.239
 I unfold my taste 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.620
 it goes down 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.680
 then everything hatched and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.269
 really nice 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.739
 then I'll go another quote yet 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.810
 to 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:47.290
 So my living and Qatar rinsed well 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 penultimate are bitter 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:14.430
 a quail and the white sand all over 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:18.260
 Let's forget about water and water 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.260
 leave that then covered so 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.210
 forty- five minutes in quiver only five 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.729
 minutes for one of the cooking I give 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.910
 then my side will you too 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.310
 so they also look easy to save 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.850
 small for the soup and yes not 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.560
 taste like this turkish suk sausage 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.580
 Suckut yes the soup is almost ready that 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.960
 means I have a little bit more now 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:55.919
 year soy sauce given that way 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:05:00.930
 my maggi-spice classical and would come 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:09.330
 some pepper with picture and nutmeg 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:17.639
 and paprika and some ground caraway 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:20.550
 and then my page is on it 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.840
 because it would have already done it should 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:30.210
 just to be heated I have 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:39.360
 taken out of the fridge and I give 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:43.580
 also parsley and dill to the short 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.389
 end because otherwise it will be completely gray 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.680
 and so it stays nice and green 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.930
 if the water is still in the frame 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.460
 MÃ¼nchen finished simmer 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.660
 so that we also have the sausages 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.060
 that I see the taste again 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.270
 we still spread ours and then 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.770
 to be eaten 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.210
 I hope you like the recipe too 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.210
 and you have a lot of fun cooking
