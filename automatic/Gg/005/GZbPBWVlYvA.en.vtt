you have perfect focus in the monitor

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.820 
you have perfect focus in the monitor
and<00:01:03.350> take<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> shot<00:01:06.170> simply<00:01:07.170> amazing<00:01:07.290> isn't

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and take the shot simply amazing isn't

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760

fasteners from the 3m corporation called
dual<00:01:23.700> lock<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> you'll<00:01:25.710> need<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> flat<00:01:26.130> surface

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
dual lock so you'll need a flat surface

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
dual lock so you'll need a flat surface
on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> front<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> lens<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.259> two<00:01:28.409> pieces

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
on the front of the lens for two pieces

on the front of the lens for two pieces
of<00:01:28.799> dual<00:01:29.070> lock<00:01:29.869> secondly<00:01:30.869> you'll<00:01:31.439> need<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
of dual lock secondly you'll need to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
of dual lock secondly you'll need to
measure<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> width<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.729> lens<00:01:33.090> window

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
measure the width of your lens window

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
measure the width of your lens window
which<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> opening<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> front
