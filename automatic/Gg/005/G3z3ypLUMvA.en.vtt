00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
turned out to be turmoil so this was a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.040 
turned out to be turmoil so this was a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
known a prude non-approved proof if you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.389 
known a prude non-approved proof if you
think<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> lines<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
think you can see the lines over this

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
think you can see the lines over this
plastic<00:00:32.399> cover<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:36.210> shows<00:00:36.480> where<00:00:36.840> the

dotted line if you can if you make it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
dotted line if you can if you make it
out<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> dotted<00:00:40.379> line<00:00:40.559> shows<00:00:40.590> where<00:00:41.309> you

out but the dotted line shows where you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.170 
out but the dotted line shows where you
fold<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.860> solid<00:00:43.860> line<00:00:44.070> shows<00:00:44.460> where<00:00:44.879> to

cut<00:00:47.480> over<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> notice<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
cut over here you can notice that it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
cut over here you can notice that it
actually<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:50.070> neo<00:00:50.370> destiny<00:00:50.789> cards<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually has neo destiny cards on the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually has neo destiny cards on the
back<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:53.489> energies<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.059> can't<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.629> tell

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
back the energies or can't really tell

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610 
back the energies or can't really tell
look<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> might<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.559> base<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.289> we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
look like it might be base but as we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
look like it might be base but as we
know<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> light<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.280> amaryl<00:00:59.699> did<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.969> end<00:01:00.210> up

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
know the light as amaryl did not end up

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.440 
know the light as amaryl did not end up
in<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.910> turmoil<00:01:03.379> legendary<00:01:04.379> deck<00:01:05.390> they<00:01:06.390> were

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in the turmoil legendary deck they were

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.780 
in the turmoil legendary deck they were
I<00:01:06.780> guess<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.080> were<00:01:07.460> contemplating<00:01:08.460> naming

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I guess they were contemplating naming

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.450 
I guess they were contemplating naming
the<00:01:08.970> set<00:01:09.210> champions<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> did<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> proof

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the set champions but did not this proof

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
the set champions but did not this proof
is<00:01:14.670> actually<00:01:15.030> quite<00:01:15.420> good<00:01:15.570> condition<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
is actually quite good condition you can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.330 
is actually quite good condition you can
see<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> color<00:01:16.920> bars<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:20.040> full

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
see the color bars right there the full

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
see the color bars right there the full
just<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> making<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.869> hard<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just kind of making that little hard to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.480 
just kind of making that little hard to
read<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.299> things

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.880 

here's<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> other<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.820> who<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.890> magma

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
here's the other one who have the magma

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670 
here's the other one who have the magma
which<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.000> should<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
which it should be which it was of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.550 
which it should be which it was of
course<00:01:37.979> changed<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.490> lava<00:01:38.899> so<00:01:39.899> magma<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.409> not

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
course changed to lava so magma was not

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
course changed to lava so magma was not
approved<00:01:40.799> either<00:01:41.180> these<00:01:42.180> were<00:01:42.299> both<00:01:42.509> proofs

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
approved either these were both proofs

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.810 
approved either these were both proofs
that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.380> off<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> guys<00:01:44.789> from

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that I got off the one of the guys from

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.969 
that I got off the one of the guys from
that<00:01:45.030> did<00:01:45.299> from<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> design<00:01:46.259> team<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.680> wizards

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that did from the design team or wizards

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
that did from the design team or wizards
of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> coast<00:01:47.539> again<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.780> says<00:01:48.929> champions

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
of the coast again it says champions

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.760 
of the coast again it says champions
instead<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:49.950> legendary<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.380> over<00:01:52.530> here

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
instead of legendary we look over here

instead of legendary we look over here
the<00:01:52.950> holler<00:01:53.159> she<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> dark<00:01:54.299> typhlosion<00:01:55.640> which

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the holler she was dark typhlosion which

the holler she was dark typhlosion which
we<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.149> wasn't<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:58.080> hell<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.060> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
we know that wasn't the hell in it this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
we know that wasn't the hell in it this
was<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:01.549> legendary<00:02:02.549> thing<00:02:03.179> Nick<00:02:03.420> lava<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.790 
actually had the legendary theme decks
but<00:02:37.530> i<00:02:37.620> guess<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.250> entire<00:02:38.610> foal<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:40.560> made

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
but i guess the entire foal was made

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.190 
but i guess the entire foal was made
like<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.730> legendary<00:02:42.090> steam<00:02:42.360> next<00:02:42.660> up<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.960> I

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
like the legendary steam next up is I

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.020 
like the legendary steam next up is I
guess<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.460> when<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.840> flip<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.820> theme

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
guess so that when you flip the theme

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.340 
guess so that when you flip the theme
deck<00:02:48.210> back<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.540> forth<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
deck back and forth you can see the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
deck back and forth you can see the
whole<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.160> which<00:02:50.370> i<00:02:50.490> think<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.700> really<00:02:50.940> cool

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
whole on it which i think is really cool

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.270 
whole on it which i think is really cool
it's<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:51.990> coolest<00:02:52.290> holler<00:02:52.620> fools<00:02:52.890> from
