00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.859
 We got an e-mail yesterday 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 from a mother who writes the following 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 I came across them because I was the one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.849
 right hand gesture for writing instruments 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.039
 search can you explain to me how to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.859
 the pencil or pen right in the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hand holds or writes 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 have a child in first grade and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 I want you to have the right attitude 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 Unfortunately, the teachers do not pay attention 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.790
 and unfortunately I have nothing in it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.700
 internet asked the question about the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 handling the writing instruments is despite 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 and yet clearly answer 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 the rest of this e-mail requires one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.350
 somewhat more intense opinion of his 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 reason why teachers do not care 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.789
 Let's take care now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.289
 this to the right interception 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.190
 I'll take care of that then 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.270
 in addition to the glove off it is about 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.760
 from miss the pen 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.840
 this is the right pen attitude 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 The index finger is the writing finger 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.790
 The pen should be parallel to the index finger 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.150
 to be held by the thumb and indeed in 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.729
 this attitude is not here in front and also 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 not behind such an appropriate 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:36.409
 here in the front third of the pen 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.210
 itself is then here on the front 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.530
 on the first song of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.509
 mittelfingers shortly before the joint there 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.369
 light pen on so that the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.210
 Forefinger while writing 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.149
 slightly bent 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 this is the right attitude then 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:03.460
 can your child write and print 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.099
 and train that is called occurs 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.590
 Train is easier on soft writing 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.269
 no case that would be now is now 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.790
 easy is already in the second 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.129
 part of the answer to the ladies about it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:25.370
 that means that your child 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:30.500
 in writing like that and that's graf 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:35.239
 Motor wrong so it is important 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.650
 this hand position with the child had to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.080
 Actually also adults still exercise 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 this attitude here where the 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.390
 index finger and index finger and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.989
 Middle Finger Touching Looks Easy 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.390
 postponed 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.690
 Here you put the pen on it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.660
 with your thumb and then we go 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.829
 the arm light of the forearm is not easy 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.130
 on the table the left hand holds that 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.170
 paper can be with the elbow on the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.269
 but it does not have to lie around it 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 how high are the children? 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:17.950
 Write important is that angle 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:21.970
 So it's not right here but here 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.709
 elastic slightly loose in the wrist 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.389
 not from the country 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.010
 wriggle out and 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.739
 certainly not out of the shoulder 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.829
 So let's leave this whole fog 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.030
 besides , the screaming motion is ignored 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.700
 can be found here in the front with these 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.459
 fingers instead 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.170
 this substance the hand edge is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.400
 so to speak, the sled on the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.310
 written or written weighing 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.130
 instead of 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.530
 maybe here the lightly so 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.540
 can be written 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.700
 this would be to this this clan now 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.069
 here only on the hitler would be with the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.890
 with the little finger down 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:15.190
 that would be wrong again but so 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.410
 Put this hurt on paper and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.260
 Let's go this is the right writing 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.020
 stop there are no discussions 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.639
 about it and important is just there 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.460
 But then we come in the second 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.479
 as a more detailed video still on it 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.419
 back that the pin is round necessarily 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.389
 round it in hand here between 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.560
 Forefinger and thumb 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.960
 turned when in the axis of the must 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.520
 can be turned because that too there 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.360
 you just go with the pen 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.139
 bit playfully around because to 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.120
 to lead a relaxation 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.490
 By the way, and must look 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.720
 often pen during writing too 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.570
 be easily turned remember the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.400
 otherwise so here this direction that 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.830
 sometimes you do not realize it is 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.990
 very important as a sign 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:11.500
 you learn that after I have to me 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.720
 But mine is the mine writes 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.340
 from the front and thereby the pen is then 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.590
 the pen has to be turned slightly 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.900
 but also while writing while 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.789
 one writes the letters becomes the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.330
 pen turned slightly that was the short one 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:32.340
 answer 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:34.330
 now comes the slightly longer and 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.750
 I call the time now 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.850
 That is not only now 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.820
 longer but that is very detailed 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.780
 and 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.700
 I have to say the teacher situation 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:51.940
 he would have lit up and that 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.940
 is also very important so that same
