00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hi, it's famous "YUKKURI" on Japanese video site. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I am moving by car after a long time. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 It is sunny today but not hot as I expected. It would be nice if I got on a motorcycle, but because there was a shopping, I decided to use a car that could carry luggage. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 When I drove a car for the first time in a long time, I realized that I felt different from a motorcycle. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Depending on the condition of the road surface, I felt a bit seasick if I rocked sideways. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I ran with caution because I had the timing to put a brake on a motorcycle. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Well, the destination is always a DIY shop to go. I went to buy mission oil of NSR75. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 I bought an oil mug and a box dedicated to oil processing. (In Japan, the processing method is decided by the law) 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 It is a garage. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 When most people take a video, I think they show what they bought. I only thought about doing maintenance, so I forgot to show it. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Before changing oil, I also changed the exhaust gasket. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 I don't know if the parts I bought before will fit, so for now try it. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 I bought gaskets for both NS-1 and NSR80. Either is predicted to fit. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Either will not fit, and both may not. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 From the conclusion, the gasket of NSR80 has been fitted. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The story changed, but I was following the gasket, which I thought was not attached, on the engine side. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 In fact, this metal type gasket is the first time, but I thought it was just something that was crushed like a washer and used. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 In other words, it is sandwiched between paper gaskets, and the sealing rate is increased by crushing. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So at least there is a step like a paper gasket. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 As I thought so, the surface on the engine side was uniform, so I misidentified it as not. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 When I removed the chamber this time, I was able to stick to the paper gasket I attached last time. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 There was a groove on the engine side. It is a misunderstanding. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 The principle that can be predicted from this shape and thickness is that the metal ring thermally expands to increase the sealing ratio. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 The surface of the metal ring is made of the same material as a paper gasket. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 In the old days, oil was substituted by 4-stroke engine oil. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 This time, at the DIY shop, a product that is specified as Castrol's 2-stroke mission oil was sold. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 When I was riding on the RD 250, I was a little worried because I had an oil leak when I put Castrol oil. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 However, I liked the point that it was only for 2 strokes, and I bought it. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Unlike 2-stroke transmission oil, which is exposed to exhaust, it is prone to contamination unlike 4-stroke. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Unlike the old bike, the NSR 75 may be improved. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 However, if it is a 2-stroke oil, I expect that it may be manufactured considering that side as well. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 At first, I also bought HONDA oil. If Castrol oil leaks, change to HONDA oil. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Before, two-stroke engine oil, because the oil pump discharge volume and viscosity are compatible, I heard the comment that it is better to be genuine. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I also bought a HONDA 2-stroke engine oil. The same price as the oil made by YAMAHA was sold. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Have you changed the oil pressure, will the clutch stick be improved? 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 On a hot summer day, the garage is hot and there are many mosquitoes, so I do not want to force maintenance. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 I am planning to go on long touring with the GZ250 after September. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 If the clutch is completely stuck before riding for a long time, it may be necessary to repair it. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 If you maintain it today, you can go to touring with confidence. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Why go to touring with the GZ 250 instead of the NSR 75? 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 It will be explained later. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 SEE YOU NEXT TIME! 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Give me some fluid. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Please pour in more deeply. 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Many came in. 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 ATTENTION !!. This is the story of Mission Oil.
