00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.009
 professionals is a very dangerous key 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.260
 this can not be done by anyone other than 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.510
 they professional fighters of 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.120
 training 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.940
 that I've seen them work and that's why 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.490
 my respect for him because I know he feels 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.070
 in the woman involved in the world of 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.080
 wrestling tries to make an effort and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.880
 that there are many women who are already fighters 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.880
 they do this kind of thing 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.000
 please show 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.519
 I still do not know the whole forehead to the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.760
 half in half but it's about that 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.640
 strap on the try to climb in their 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.280
 legs tries to raise his legs to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.930
 which the shoulders and then you have to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.530
 turn to release the body and then 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.260
 He throws with his legs the symbol that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.880
 space 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 to then do slowly and I ask 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 you who take care of her protect her 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 because it's something they should not do in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 home only professional fighters who 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.910
 take care of it with pizzas that are not 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.910
 clowns are professional wrestlers 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.420
 clowns 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 to drink 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.030
 I would 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 I would like those who spoke and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 they put amazing things on my facebook 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 if they have a little bit of grief and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.450
 embarrassment to the comments that you make 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.759
 both angel and above without knowing what 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.280
 it's about me I just showed you this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.789
 they are professionals already want the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.509
 who write on social networks do what 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.509
 that we just saw 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.970
 I want to congratulate again and I do not 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.430
 I'll tire of doing it in him for the effort 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.430
