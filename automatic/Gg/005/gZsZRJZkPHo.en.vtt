00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
actual deck itself talk about some of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the quick features and then I'm going to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
the quick features and then I'm going to
break<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> up<00:00:18.810> feature<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.680> feature<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.340> at

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
break it up feature by feature so at

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
break it up feature by feature so at
least<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.619> 30-minute<00:00:22.619> documentary

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
least it's not a 30-minute documentary

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
least it's not a 30-minute documentary
but<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:24.330> 30<00:00:24.570> min<00:00:24.720> talk<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.050> you're

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
but basically 30 min talk when you're

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.990 
but basically 30 min talk when you're
broken<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> pieces<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.130> people<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.519> flip

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
broken up in a pieces so people can flip

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
broken up in a pieces so people can flip
to<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.160> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to what they really want to see this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
to what they really want to see this
deck<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.390> nice<00:00:30.510> deck<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.170> two

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
deck very very nice deck is about two

hundred<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.160> eighty-nine<00:00:33.149> dollars<00:00:33.860> plus<00:00:34.860> i

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
hundred and eighty-nine dollars plus i

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.700 
hundred and eighty-nine dollars plus i
believe<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.550> shipping<00:00:35.880> cost<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.390> about

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
believe the shipping cost was about

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
believe the shipping cost was about
fifteen<00:00:37.710> dollars<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.340> China<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:39.210> Taiwan<00:00:39.239> i

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
fifteen dollars from China or Taiwan i

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
fifteen dollars from China or Taiwan i
think<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> was<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.290> canada<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.640> therefore<00:00:41.820> it's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
think it was to canada so therefore it's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.639 
think it was to canada so therefore it's
about<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> $300<00:00:42.719> deck<00:00:42.960> by<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> time<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> finish

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
about a $300 deck by the time you finish

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.850 
about a $300 deck by the time you finish
but<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> might<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.559> too

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
but what you get for it might not be too

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.150 
but what you get for it might not be too
pleasing<00:00:47.520> without<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> pad<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.440> also

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
pleasing without the pad in it but also

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
pleasing without the pad in it but also
kind<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> works<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> sense<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.300> nobodies

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

their website says up to 4 gigs but i

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
their website says up to 4 gigs but i
actually<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.220> tested<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> eight

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
actually have tested this with a eight

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.560 
actually have tested this with a eight
gig<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> works<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> deck<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.970> 32

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
gig and it works on the deck and a 32

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
gig and it works on the deck and a 32
gig<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> pad<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.580> information

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
gig in the pad so it's that information

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
gig in the pad so it's that information
needs<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.210> changed<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> TV

tuner which i think is primarily for

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.039 
tuner which i think is primarily for
those<00:01:32.939> who<00:01:33.210> are<00:01:33.270> looking<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.540> over-the-air

sound<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:36.959> equinox<00:02:37.590> which<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> 2005

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
sound in my equinox which is a 2005

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.309 
sound in my equinox which is a 2005
chevrolet<00:02:38.910> equinox<00:02:39.079> doesn't<00:02:40.079> have<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
chevrolet equinox doesn't have that

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.900 
chevrolet equinox doesn't have that
option<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.739> didn't<00:02:40.920> opt<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> bose<00:02:41.579> sound

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
option I didn't opt for the bose sound

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.100 
option I didn't opt for the bose sound
system<00:02:41.970> when<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.269> picked<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> pinnacle<00:02:42.989> so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
system when I picked up the pinnacle so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.080 
system when I picked up the pinnacle so
therefore<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.069> standard<00:02:44.370> audio

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
therefore it's just your standard audio

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.470 
therefore it's just your standard audio
but<00:02:45.599> still<00:02:45.870> sounds<00:02:46.290> pretty<00:02:46.370> decent<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.180> that's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
but still sounds pretty decent so that's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.839 
but still sounds pretty decent so that's
basically<00:02:49.019> information<00:02:49.650> about<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.920> deck<00:02:50.190> I

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
Bluetooth based pad to this deck so you

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.280 
Bluetooth based pad to this deck so you
don't<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:08.910> require<00:03:09.209> any<00:03:09.780> other<00:03:09.989> kind<00:03:10.200> of

don't actually require any other kind of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.449 
don't actually require any other kind of
plugins<00:03:10.530> you're<00:03:10.799> just<00:03:10.950> plugging<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.400> know

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
plugins you're just plugging you know

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.910 
plugins you're just plugging you know
actually<00:03:11.790> run<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.299> over<00:03:12.480> Bluetooth<00:03:13.440> properly

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
actually run it over Bluetooth properly

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.020 
actually run it over Bluetooth properly
as<00:03:14.760> well<00:03:15.150> as<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.989> aspect<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:17.030> controlling

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
as well as the aspect of controlling

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.309 
as well as the aspect of controlling
everything<00:03:19.040> via<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.340> deck<00:03:20.549> itself<00:03:20.700> or

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
everything via the deck itself or

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.199 
everything via the deck itself or
through<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.530> pad<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> pad<00:03:23.700> actually<00:03:24.090> acts

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
through the pad so the pad actually acts

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.610 
through the pad so the pad actually acts
like<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.480> full<00:03:24.750> screen<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.260> not<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
like a full screen it's not just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.039 
like a full screen it's not just
android-based<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.090> does<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.630> windows

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
android-based but it does have a windows

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.000 
android-based but it does have a windows
ce<00:03:28.410> e<00:03:28.669> element<00:03:29.669> where<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.970> actually<00:03:30.150> gives<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
ce e element where it actually gives a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.440 
ce e element where it actually gives a
graphical<00:03:32.010> representation<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.299> these

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
graphical representation of all these

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.680 
graphical representation of all these
physical<00:03:33.930> buttons<00:03:34.230> on<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:35.190> deck<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.269> that's

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
physical buttons on the deck so that's

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.319 
physical buttons on the deck so that's
basically<00:03:36.870> an<00:03:37.169> intro<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.919> I'll<00:03:38.700> go<00:03:39.209> into

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
basically an intro of it I'll go into

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.000 
basically an intro of it I'll go into

detail of other things it does come with
a<00:03:41.069> remote<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.180> kind<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.540> useless<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.989> use

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
a remote which is kind of useless to use

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.990 
a remote which is kind of useless to use
the<00:03:43.260> remote<00:03:43.530> since<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.519> already<00:03:44.639> have<00:03:44.880> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
the remote since you already have the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.680 
the remote since you already have the
pad<00:03:45.209> which<00:03:45.450> I've<00:03:45.569> showed<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:47.690> that's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
again basically the general portion of

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.490 
again basically the general portion of
this<00:03:51.599> deck<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.959> can<00:03:52.079> find<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:52.349> that

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this deck you can find all that

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
this deck you can find all that
information<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> ericsson<00:03:53.489> com<00:03:54.000> website

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
information on the ericsson com website

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.449 
information on the ericsson com website
but<00:03:55.200> again<00:03:55.500> some<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.040> needs<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.250> be<00:03:56.310> updated

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
but again some of it needs to be updated

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.520 
but again some of it needs to be updated
because<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.269> media<00:03:57.419> slot<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.169> as<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.379> can

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
because the media slot here as you can

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.039 
because the media slot here as you can
see<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.329> microSD<00:04:00.329> slot<00:04:00.359> if<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:00.810> goes

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
see it's a microSD slot if this goes

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.349 
see it's a microSD slot if this goes
into<00:04:01.200> focus<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.549> slot<00:04:03.030> can

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
into focus like so that slot can

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.539 
into focus like so that slot can
actually<00:04:03.629> hold<00:04:03.750> up<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.989> eight<00:04:04.200> gigs<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.829> on

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
actually hold up to eight gigs and on

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.640 
actually hold up to eight gigs and on
the<00:04:05.819> pad<00:04:06.060> itself<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.930> pad<00:04:07.109> actually<00:04:07.500> has<00:04:07.620> a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the pad itself the pad actually has a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.710 
the pad itself the pad actually has a
slot<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.220> side<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.549> which<00:04:09.060> holds

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
