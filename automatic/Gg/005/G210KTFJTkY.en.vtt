UT<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.979> want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> form<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> will<00:02:13.830> push

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
UT we want to form this so I will push

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.820 
UT we want to form this so I will push
up<00:02:14.340> through<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> bottom<00:02:15.410> making<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.620> little

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
up through the bottom making a little

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.910 
up through the bottom making a little
dent<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.460> then<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.060> start<00:02:18.390> rounding<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
dent and then just start rounding the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.090 
dent and then just start rounding the
flower<00:02:20.220> edges<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.320> shape<00:02:22.710> them<00:02:22.920> however

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
flower edges you can shape them however

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
flower edges you can shape them however
you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.180> mine<00:02:24.390> pointing<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you want I have mine pointing down and a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.090 
you want I have mine pointing down and a
little<00:02:25.800> crooked<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.970> they<00:02:27.330> tear<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:28.020> find<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
little crooked if they tear I find that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920 
little crooked if they tear I find that
it's<00:02:29.280> no<00:02:29.490> big<00:02:29.760> deal<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> adds<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
it's no big deal because it adds a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.550 
it's no big deal because it adds a
little<00:02:30.960> character<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.040> flower<00:02:32.310> itself<00:02:33.560> so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
little character to the flower itself so

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.470 
little character to the flower itself so
then<00:02:34.770> we<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.460> section<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.210> flower

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
then we have a section of the flower

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.730 
then we have a section of the flower
that<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.650> ready<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.250> dip<00:02:38.490> into<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.090> UT<00:02:39.740> now

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
that is ready to dip into the UT now

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.300 
that is ready to dip into the UT now
hopefully<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.700> UT<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.300> melted<00:02:43.130> they'll<00:02:44.130> move

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
hopefully my UT is melted they'll move

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.910 
hopefully my UT is melted they'll move
the<00:02:44.370> melting<00:02:44.970> pot<00:02:45.180> over<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> look<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the melting pot over and have a look and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.910 
the melting pot over and have a look and
it<00:02:49.920> looks<00:02:50.130> good<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.550> me<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:52.410> I'll<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.770> is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it looks good to me so what I'll do is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.060 
it looks good to me so what I'll do is
starting<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> base<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.810> flower<00:02:55.080> I'm

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
starting with the base of the flower I'm

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.640 
starting with the base of the flower I'm
just<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.459> dip<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.000> into<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.510> UT<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.110> pair

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
just going to dip it into the UT a pair

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.720 
just going to dip it into the UT a pair
of<00:02:58.680> tweezers<00:02:59.810> which<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:01.080> help<00:03:01.290> me<00:03:01.500> work<00:03:02.489> this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
of tweezers which will help me work this

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.930 
of tweezers which will help me work this
around<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.390> pull<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:04.850> you're<00:03:05.850> going

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
around and then pull it out you're going

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.420 
around and then pull it out you're going
to<00:03:06.030> make<00:03:06.209> sure<00:03:06.450> both<00:03:06.690> sides<00:03:06.750> are<00:03:07.320> covered<00:03:07.560> well

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.459 

as<00:03:13.909> you<00:03:14.060> can<00:03:14.269> see<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.599> bubbles<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.319> it's

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
as you can see it bubbles and it's

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.099 
as you can see it bubbles and it's
turning<00:03:15.920> white<00:03:16.129> but<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.000> whites<00:03:17.269> no<00:03:17.599> big<00:03:17.840> deal

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
turning white but the whites no big deal

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.429 
turning white but the whites no big deal
don't<00:03:18.349> get<00:03:18.680> alarmed<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.280> will<00:03:19.489> eventually<00:03:20.439> it

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
don't get alarmed it will eventually it

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.160 
don't get alarmed it will eventually it
just<00:03:21.709> goes<00:03:22.010> away<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.510> need<00:03:23.719> to<00:03:23.840> get<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
just goes away so I need to get the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.380 
just goes away so I need to get the
center<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.129> flower<00:03:25.189> piece<00:03:25.879> if<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.209> would

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
center of this flower piece if I would

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.000 
center of this flower piece if I would
quit<00:03:26.599> burning<00:03:26.959> my<00:03:27.049> fingers<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.980> I

have this I'm going to pull it up and
let<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.290> drain<00:03:37.780> hopefully<00:03:38.780> there<00:03:39.290> we<00:03:39.469> go<00:03:39.650> just

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
let it drain hopefully there we go just

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.819 
let it drain hopefully there we go just
hold<00:03:41.269> up<00:03:41.359> your<00:03:41.420> flower<00:03:41.840> piece<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.500> let<00:03:42.680> the

hold up your flower piece and let the
excess<00:03:43.310> UT<00:03:43.760> drain<00:03:44.060> off<00:03:44.269> now<00:03:45.019> I'm<00:03:45.109> using<00:03:45.349> my

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
excess UT drain off now I'm using my

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.659 
excess UT drain off now I'm using my
Ranger<00:03:46.220> nan<00:03:46.430> craft<00:03:48.040> nonstick<00:03:49.040> craft<00:03:49.370> sheet

Ranger nan craft nonstick craft sheet

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.089 
Ranger nan craft nonstick craft sheet
and<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:50.329> going<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.599> just<00:03:50.810> lay<00:03:51.500> my<00:03:51.530> flower

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
and I'm going to just lay my flower

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.000 
and I'm going to just lay my flower
piece<00:03:52.459> down<00:03:52.730> on<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.480> sheet<00:03:54.379> no<00:03:55.310> big<00:03:55.519> deal

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
piece down on the sheet no big deal

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.679 
piece down on the sheet no big deal
we'll<00:03:58.010> start<00:03:58.340> again<00:03:58.519> with<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:58.969> next<00:03:59.329> layer

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
we'll start again with the next layer

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.240 
we'll start again with the next layer
and<00:04:00.019> we're<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.439> going<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.620> build<00:04:00.859> this

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and we're just going to build this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.720 
and we're just going to build this
flower<00:04:01.849> from<00:04:02.689> the<00:04:02.840> bottom<00:04:03.200> up<00:04:03.409> so<00:04:03.709> I'm<00:04:04.549> going

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
flower from the bottom up so I'm going

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.209 
flower from the bottom up so I'm going
to<00:04:04.790> keep<00:04:04.969> dipping<00:04:05.450> each<00:04:05.689> layer<00:04:06.079> into<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.859> UT

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
to keep dipping each layer into the UT

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.729 
to keep dipping each layer into the UT
making<00:04:07.669> sure<00:04:07.879> I<00:04:07.909> get<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.209> covered<00:04:08.719> well<00:04:09.879> and

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
making sure I get it covered well and

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.729 
making sure I get it covered well and
draining<00:04:12.739> each<00:04:12.889> piece<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.760> excess<00:04:14.329> UT<00:04:14.780> now

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
draining each piece of the excess UT now

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.680 
draining each piece of the excess UT now
when<00:04:15.919> you<00:04:16.009> bring<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:16.489> out<00:04:16.759> and<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.209> apply<00:04:17.630> it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
when you bring this out and you apply it

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.020 
when you bring this out and you apply it
to<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.079> bottom<00:04:18.530> layer<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:19.519> might<00:04:19.789> need<00:04:19.970> a

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
to the bottom layer you might need a

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.420 
to the bottom layer you might need a
little<00:04:20.269> help<00:04:20.510> getting<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.989> off<00:04:21.139> but<00:04:22.070> what's

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
little help getting it off but what's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.939 
little help getting it off but what's
great<00:04:22.669> about<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.599> where<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:24.289> falls<00:04:24.590> it

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
great about it is where it falls it

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.250 
great about it is where it falls it
stays<00:04:25.310> most<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> time<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.900> UT

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
stays most of the time and the UT

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.879 
stays most of the time and the UT
actually<00:04:28.130> acts<00:04:28.370> as<00:04:28.699> your<00:04:29.120> glue<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:30.740> hold

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
actually acts as your glue to hold

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.490 
actually acts as your glue to hold
everything<00:04:31.280> into<00:04:31.729> place<00:04:31.880> once<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:32.570> dries<00:04:35.500> we

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
everything into place once it dries we

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.700 
everything into place once it dries we
have<00:04:36.680> one<00:04:36.949> more<00:04:37.190> layer

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.770 

and<00:04:41.250> all<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.460> these<00:04:41.759> layers<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.360> been<00:04:42.389> cut

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
and all of these layers have been cut

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.020 
and all of these layers have been cut
and<00:04:42.930> folded<00:04:43.320> over<00:04:43.500> one<00:04:43.919> time<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.310> didn't<00:04:44.850> cut

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
and folded over one time I didn't cut

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.140 
and folded over one time I didn't cut
any<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.600> excess<00:04:46.080> out<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.639> folded<00:04:48.000> it

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
any of the excess out I just folded it

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.330 
any of the excess out I just folded it
over<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.479> glued<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.979> could<00:04:50.130> have

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
over and glued it so that it could have

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.189 
over and glued it so that it could have
some<00:04:50.610> type<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:51.030> shape<00:04:52.009> and<00:04:53.479> we<00:04:54.479> have<00:04:54.750> there's

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
some type of shape and we have there's

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.189 
some type of shape and we have there's
our<00:04:55.380> third<00:04:55.650> layer<00:04:56.270> as<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.479> can<00:04:57.660> see<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.139> just

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
our third layer as you can see it just

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.230 
our third layer as you can see it just
kind<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.680> sets<00:04:59.009> there<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:02.000> we're<00:05:03.000> just<00:05:03.150> gonna

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
kind of sets there and we're just gonna

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.240 
kind of sets there and we're just gonna
keep<00:05:03.509> going<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:04.169> hope<00:05:04.470> you're<00:05:04.680> patient<00:05:04.919> with<00:05:05.220> me

but as you can see I was able to pick it

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.200 
but as you can see I was able to pick it
right<00:06:43.870> up<00:06:44.050> off<00:06:44.350> my<00:06:44.560> craft<00:06:44.860> sheet<00:06:45.010> and<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:46.180> can

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
right up off my craft sheet and I can

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.440 
right up off my craft sheet and I can
already<00:06:46.630> touch<00:06:47.050> it<00:06:47.350> and<00:06:48.120> there's<00:06:49.120> a<00:06:49.180> little

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
already touch it and there's a little

little<00:06:49.900> rough<00:06:50.140> but<00:06:50.500> we<00:06:50.620> can<00:06:50.860> just<00:06:51.850> smooth

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
little rough but we can just smooth

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.010 
little rough but we can just smooth
those<00:06:52.420> out<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:54.060> actually<00:06:55.060> let's<00:06:55.660> try<00:06:55.960> this

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
those out and actually let's try this

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.020 
those out and actually let's try this
