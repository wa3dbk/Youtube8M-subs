game<00:00:55.469> mode<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.190> number<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.480> number<00:00:57.629> one

shrieks<00:02:51.960> as<00:02:52.110> well<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.500> whenever<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.460> my

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990

whenever I get my final kill trick I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.880 
whenever I get my final kill trick I
believe<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.330> bombing<00:02:57.600> run<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.710> just

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
believe that's a bombing run I can just

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.120 
believe that's a bombing run I can just
basically<00:02:59.660> blitzkrieg<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.930> entire<00:03:01.590> section

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
basically blitzkrieg that entire section

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.950 
basically blitzkrieg that entire section
of<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> map<00:03:02.430> which<00:03:03.000> basically<00:03:03.300> opens<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> up

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
of the map which basically opens it up

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.600 
of the map which basically opens it up
for<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.260> team<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.740> as<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.100> see<00:03:05.250> i<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.490> my

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
for my team so as you can see i got my

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.700 
for my team so as you can see i got my
bombing<00:03:05.970> run<00:03:06.120> right<00:03:06.330> here<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.080> i'm<00:03:07.440> probably

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
bombing run right here so i'm probably

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.350 
bombing run right here so i'm probably
gonna<00:03:07.950> call<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.790> few<00:03:09.030> i'm<00:03:09.180> not

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
game by a lot so the momentum it can

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.949 
game by a lot so the momentum it can
work<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.790> both<00:03:41.970> ways<00:03:42.209> say<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> want<00:03:42.870> to

improve your window loss ratio if you're
playing<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.630> full<00:03:45.840> party<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.650> win

playing in a full party you can win
momentum<00:03:47.459> games<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.080> matter<00:03:49.290> of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
momentum games in this in the matter of

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.860 
momentum games in this in the matter of
a<00:03:49.560> minute<00:03:49.769> 30<00:03:50.160> seconds<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:51.840> to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
push their base a lot and that's it the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.840

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
can purposely just stay off the flag

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.170 
can purposely just stay off the flag
constantly<00:04:04.860> get<00:04:05.040> kills<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.580> then<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
out too well and like I here I was

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.439 
out too well and like I here I was
lagging<00:04:58.979> a<00:04:59.070> lot<00:04:59.250> too<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.580> don't<00:04:59.970> know<00:05:00.060> what<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
lagging a lot too I don't know what it

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.150 
lagging a lot too I don't know what it
was<00:05:00.599> definitely<00:05:01.110> wasn't<00:05:01.470> my<00:05:01.650> internet<00:05:02.009> I

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
was definitely wasn't my internet I

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.189 
was definitely wasn't my internet I
don't<00:05:02.400> know<00:05:02.490> what<00:05:02.759> was<00:05:02.910> happening<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.449> was<00:05:03.990> like

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
don't know what was happening I was like

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.830 
don't know what was happening I was like
and<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:05.220> fourth<00:05:05.580> reason<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.509> I<00:05:06.539> like

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
and the fourth reason that I like

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.810 
and the fourth reason that I like
momentum<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.830> probably<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.430> biggest

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
momentum this is probably the biggest

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.029 
momentum this is probably the biggest
reason<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.599> just<00:05:10.110> truly<00:05:10.349> love<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.860> game

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
reason that I just truly love this game

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.520 
reason that I just truly love this game
mode<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.330> fact<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.690> there's<00:05:13.020> always

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
mode is the fact that there's always

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.950 
mode is the fact that there's always
constant<00:05:14.190> action<00:05:14.449> just<00:05:15.449> because<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.870> fact

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
constant action just because of the fact

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960 
constant action just because of the fact
that<00:05:16.259> both<00:05:16.530> teams<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.280> fight<00:05:17.520> for<00:05:17.550> one

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
that both teams have to fight for one

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.270 
that both teams have to fight for one
objective<00:05:18.570> it's<00:05:18.810> not<00:05:19.259> like<00:05:19.440> domination<00:05:20.099> where

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
objective it's not like domination where

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.529 
objective it's not like domination where
there<00:05:20.400> are<00:05:20.460> three<00:05:20.699> objectives<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.330> worry

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
there are three objectives to worry

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.600 
there are three objectives to worry
about<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.020> there's<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.259> huge<00:05:22.590> spawn<00:05:22.979> trap<00:05:23.340> and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
about and there's a huge spawn trap and

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.969 
about and there's a huge spawn trap and
everything<00:05:23.970> like<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.560> momentum<00:05:25.560> there's

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
everything like that momentum there's

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.670 
everything like that momentum there's
one<00:05:26.280> flag<00:05:26.610> one<00:05:27.300> objective<00:05:27.810> which<00:05:27.990> both<00:05:28.320> teams

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
one flag one objective which both teams

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.580 
one flag one objective which both teams
are<00:05:28.860> pushing<00:05:29.580> for<00:05:29.610> at<00:05:30.060> all<00:05:30.449> times<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.409> there's

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
are pushing for at all times so there's

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.589 
are pushing for at all times so there's
always<00:05:31.889> gunfights<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.940> guys<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.330> see<00:05:33.360> the

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
always gunfights you guys can see the

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.689 
always gunfights you guys can see the
kill<00:05:33.810> feed<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.260> just<00:05:34.530> constantly<00:05:35.340> moving

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
kill feed is just constantly moving

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.879 
kill feed is just constantly moving
there's<00:05:36.030> never<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.449> time<00:05:36.539> where<00:05:37.050> it's<00:05:37.169> just<00:05:37.740> you

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
there's never a time where it's just you

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.969 
there's never a time where it's just you

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
know frozen this kill streak has to go

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.040 
know frozen this kill streak has to go
system<00:05:41.669> act<00:05:41.880> it's<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.240> most<00:05:42.449> stupid

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
system act it's the most stupid

system act it's the most stupid
scorestreak<00:05:43.650> I've<00:05:43.770> ever<00:05:44.010> seen<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.490> my<00:05:44.520> life

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
scorestreak I've ever seen in my life

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.790 
scorestreak I've ever seen in my life
they<00:05:45.510> really<00:05:45.840> need<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.020> change<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.650> don't

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
they really need to change that I don't

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.589 
they really need to change that I don't
know<00:05:46.860> what<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.010> guys<00:05:47.220> think<00:05:47.490> but<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.449> my

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
know what you guys think but in my

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.560 
know what you guys think but in my
opinion<00:05:48.690> it's<00:05:49.620> just<00:05:49.889> really<00:05:50.039> stupid<00:05:50.550> now<00:05:51.060> back

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
opinion it's just really stupid now back

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.999 
opinion it's just really stupid now back
to<00:05:51.599> what<00:05:51.780> i<00:05:51.840> was<00:05:51.900> saying<00:05:52.020> again<00:05:52.500> constant

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
to what i was saying again constant

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.219 
to what i was saying again constant
action<00:05:53.220> both<00:05:54.000> teams<00:05:54.210> are<00:05:54.360> constantly<00:05:54.900> pushing

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
action both teams are constantly pushing

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.420 
action both teams are constantly pushing
each<00:05:55.349> other<00:05:55.530> you're<00:05:55.770> constantly<00:05:56.159> getting

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
each other you're constantly getting

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.670 
each other you're constantly getting
UAVs<00:05:56.940> up<00:05:57.150> in<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> air<00:05:57.509> other<00:05:57.780> scorestreaks<00:05:58.530> as

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
UAVs up in the air other scorestreaks as

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.939 
UAVs up in the air other scorestreaks as
well<00:05:58.889> so<00:05:59.610> I<00:06:00.169> just<00:06:01.169> like<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.470> fact<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.800> you're

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
well so I just like the fact that you're

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.270 
well so I just like the fact that you're
always<00:06:02.220> in<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.610> gunfight<00:06:02.849> you're<00:06:03.360> never<00:06:03.780> really

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
always in a gunfight you're never really

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.399 
always in a gunfight you're never really
in<00:06:05.280> a<00:06:05.699> stale<00:06:06.090> moment<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.780> what<00:06:07.020> I'm<00:06:07.139> trying<00:06:07.380> to

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
in a stale moment is what I'm trying to

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.140 
in a stale moment is what I'm trying to
say<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.860> hard<00:06:08.039> point<00:06:08.280> there<00:06:08.610> are<00:06:08.789> times

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
say in a hard point there are times

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.540 
say in a hard point there are times
during<00:06:09.449> rotations<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.590> cut<00:06:10.800> off<00:06:10.919> set<00:06:11.190> yeah

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
during rotations and cut off set yeah

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.100 
during rotations and cut off set yeah
there<00:06:11.909> are<00:06:12.060> still<00:06:12.389> times<00:06:12.690> in<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.930> game

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
there are still times in the game

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.920 
there are still times in the game
momentum<00:06:14.070> no<00:06:14.310> use<00:06:14.729> your<00:06:15.030> spawning<00:06:15.539> pretty

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
momentum no use your spawning pretty

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.200 
momentum no use your spawning pretty
much<00:06:16.110> right<00:06:16.530> next<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.039> flag<00:06:17.280> all<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.970> time

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
much right next to the flag all the time

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.790 
much right next to the flag all the time
you're<00:06:18.840> constantly<00:06:19.080> getting<00:06:19.500> pushed

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
you're constantly getting pushed

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.620 
you're constantly getting pushed
constantly<00:06:20.699> score<00:06:20.970> streets<00:06:21.210> are<00:06:21.330> in<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.479> air

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
constantly score streets are in the air

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.850 
constantly score streets are in the air
so<00:06:21.900> you're<00:06:22.020> pretty<00:06:22.139> much<00:06:22.259> always<00:06:22.590> in<00:06:22.800> a

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
so you're pretty much always in a

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.290 
so you're pretty much always in a
gunfight<00:06:23.039> and<00:06:23.400> that's<00:06:23.580> what<00:06:23.820> you<00:06:23.940> see<00:06:23.970> me

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
gunfight and that's what you see me

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
gunfight and that's what you see me
doing<00:06:24.330> right<00:06:24.659> here<00:06:24.690> i'm<00:06:24.930> just<00:06:25.139> always

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
doing right here i'm just always

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.339 
doing right here i'm just always
shooting<00:06:26.070> at<00:06:26.220> someone<00:06:26.460> so<00:06:27.240> that's<00:06:28.080> pretty

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
shooting at someone so that's pretty

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.469 
shooting at someone so that's pretty
much<00:06:28.440> why<00:06:28.710> i<00:06:28.740> like<00:06:28.950> momentum<00:06:29.430> guys<00:06:29.610> constant

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
much why i like momentum guys constant

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.670 
much why i like momentum guys constant
