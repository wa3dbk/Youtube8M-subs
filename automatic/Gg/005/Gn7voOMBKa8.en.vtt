00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.259
 do not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.529
 good good night and if it 's good for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.920
 start talking to the press at fc 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.320
 Barcelona 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.360
 a question by torii of gastronomy 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.310
 to pack with represent or know 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.050
 the press conference the coach 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 Barcelona enrique martínez a question 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.740
 in turn and say the name and the middle 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 what do you represent 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.360
 well 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.350
 It's very easy because there were some 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.030
 of celestial flying that's why I do not know 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.220
 can control this is a sport in the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.450
 there are two teams and despite that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.210
 we like to have control of 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.460
 match and generate 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.890
 and generate more chances that the opponent does not 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.080
 it can always be produced in the second 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.520
 we have also achieved a bit because 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.350
 the physical wear of them that they did 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.360
 the first part passes bill as not 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.210
 it can be another way and in the second 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 part of us have had more control of the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.009
 game we have been able to generate 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.509
 more but more and cost has liked 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.490
 very much we had no doubt that 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.380
 it was going to be a match like that because it 's 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.600
 true is one of the teams that better 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 press and that has the ball more 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 criterion has when playing 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.370
 good match has been open throughout 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.170
 moment I do not know what 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.580
 it's not that we suffered too many 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 chances of goal but neither do we generate 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.560
 we generate many then in this type 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.560
 of matches the individual quality of 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.409
 players is decisive and today has been 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 again in a strategy play and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.760
 and we consider that they are very 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 important because of the difficulty and why 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.830
 and why it's going to cost from here to the end 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.740
 of season all the equipment 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.790
 they have their level and here we knew that 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.790
 to be a difficult visit 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.800
 well very nice very comfortable very 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.180
 happy to greet 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.190
 to friends and people with whom I could 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.780
 work one year and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 well it's always nice for me to go back to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.070
 balaídos and also now with the beginning of 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.340
 works is even more beautiful the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.340
 stadium 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.260
 we have reached a point where it is 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.510
 clear that from the beginning we are going to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 judge by the results 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.409
 and we are on that path there are matches 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.849
 this kind of matches that can 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.700
 strengthen when they go to a rival like 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.489
 this one that you see is a rival of 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.160
 of a high football level and that you 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.780
 has generated situations when you win 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 this way it reinforces you 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.849
 I think it's a victory that they reinforce 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.260
 group and prepare us to what 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.790
 there are still many matches left 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.790
 and sure that euros 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.780
 well then when you know that you 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.510
 you face a team of this level there 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.310
 many solutions at the tactical level that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.590
 can have something else is that then the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.090
 players can find them inside 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.010
 of the playing field but our idea 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.390
 was to keep having the ball in the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 if you do not let me play then 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.010
 condition you here we can in terms of 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.420
 supports have last line solutions 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.799
 with the tips I think they have appeared 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.530
 many last line solutions but 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.209
 it's true that there have been a lot of bowling 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.340
 Individuals in which the players 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.280
 they have been a level at a very high level 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.440
 high that's a problem when 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 when you do not win those duels and still 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.979
 we have had some clear occasions the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.560
 have and apart that they should have 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.350
 lowered its pressure a bit but good 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.639
 It seems to be open until the end and 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.820
 we could have closed it a little before 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.669
 but I think it's important 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.990
 also for us to understand that all 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.000
 the parties have to work it I know that 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.000
 all parties will have their difficulty 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.190
 I've already said about xavi 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.070
 namely 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.050
 the most important player the most 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.050
 it seemed to be played in the club's history 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.370
 and has a contract in force 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.740
 it looked like it was going to come out this summer 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.050
 past this preseason passed to the end 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.940
 he stayed today has been a great 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.710
 news and 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.000
 and I think he's very focused on what 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.230
 it's this end of season to try 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840
 conquer in the maximum possible 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.260
 titles and from there the decision 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.150
 the one that takes will be accepted by all and the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.490
 general recognition that already has it 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.080
 For many seasons we have been doing 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.080
 the three other fruits please before 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.300
 of the events you already know, I do not think 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.190
 he has spoken yet 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.639
 throughout my career I never do not 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.639
 I pronounce 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.910
 we never tell players that 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.540
 force cards 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.540
 9 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.120
 winning is not bad ever man though 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:13.180
 win the barca so it's not bad they're never 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.180
 three wonderful points thank you very much
