00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and I find it so that this does dig into

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.310 
and I find it so that this does dig into
the<00:00:47.180> palm<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.450> my<00:00:47.480> hand<00:00:47.840> right<00:00:48.080> here<00:00:48.230> this

darts at once and I wasn't really game
for<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:40.479> that's<00:01:41.479> kind<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.749> cool<00:01:41.899> in<00:01:42.139> a<00:01:42.229> toy

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
for that that's kind of cool in a toy

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.020 
for that that's kind of cool in a toy
but<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.869> personally<00:01:45.619> prefer<00:01:45.979> my<00:01:46.670> things<00:01:46.909> to

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
but I personally prefer my things to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.910 
but I personally prefer my things to
fire<00:01:47.179> at<00:01:47.329> once<00:01:47.539> because<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.259> found<00:01:48.649> nerf

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
fire at once because I found nerf

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.879 
fire at once because I found nerf
shotguns<00:01:49.369> don't<00:01:49.789> really<00:01:50.060> work<00:01:50.240> all<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.539> well

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
shotguns don't really work all that well

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.599 
shotguns don't really work all that well
of<00:01:51.889> course<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.579> got<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.299> was<00:01:53.479> about

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
of course when I got this it was about

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.099 
of course when I got this it was about
seven<00:01:55.609> or<00:01:55.639> eight<00:01:55.729> bucks<00:01:55.999> at<00:01:56.329> Toys<00:01:56.539> R<00:01:56.749> Us<00:01:56.810> here

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
seven or eight bucks at Toys R Us here

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.169 
seven or eight bucks at Toys R Us here
in<00:01:57.170> Salem<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.249> I<00:01:58.280> figured<00:01:58.579> why<00:01:58.700> not<00:01:58.729> buy<00:01:59.119> it

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
in Salem so I figured why not buy it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.090 
in Salem so I figured why not buy it
when<00:01:59.689> I<00:01:59.719> got<00:01:59.929> it<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.170> found<00:02:00.380> out<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.709> it<00:02:00.859> fires

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
when I got it I found out that it fires

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.739 
when I got it I found out that it fires
one<00:02:01.549> at<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.759> time<00:02:02.079> and<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:05.270> are<00:02:05.359> a<00:02:05.420> couple<00:02:05.479> of

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
one at a time and there are a couple of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.330 
one at a time and there are a couple of
neat<00:02:05.959> features<00:02:06.350> about<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.590> firing<00:02:07.009> one<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:07.249> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
neat features about it firing one at a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.180 
neat features about it firing one at a
time<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:08.539> normally<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.590> will<00:02:09.679> fire<00:02:09.920> this

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
time it normally it will fire this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.920 
time it normally it will fire this
barrel<00:02:10.550> than<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.880> barrel<00:02:11.240> than<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.599> barrel

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
barrel than this barrel than that barrel

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.759 
barrel than this barrel than that barrel
but<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:13.640> somehow<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.720> tax<00:02:15.140> kind<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.650> on

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
but it somehow to tax kind of like on

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:16.780 
but it somehow to tax kind of like on
the<00:02:15.830> rough<00:02:16.010> cut

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the rough cut

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.929 
the rough cut
which<00:02:17.000> barrel<00:02:17.629> is<00:02:17.840> actually<00:02:18.530> loaded<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.760> if<00:02:19.849> I

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
which barrel is actually loaded so if I

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.459 
which barrel is actually loaded so if I
don't<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> dart<00:02:20.569> here<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.079> I<00:02:21.109> do<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.319> a

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
don't have a dart here but I do have a

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.920 
don't have a dart here but I do have a
dart<00:02:21.650> here<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.730> will<00:02:22.939> fire<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.450> one<00:02:23.629> first

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
dart here it will fire this one first

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.869 
dart here it will fire this one first
without<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.099> know<00:02:25.189> going<00:02:25.370> through<00:02:25.489> an<00:02:25.670> empty

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
without you know going through an empty

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.819 
without you know going through an empty
barrel<00:02:26.030> which<00:02:26.689> is<00:02:26.810> really<00:02:27.140> cool<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.349> I'm<00:02:27.620> kind

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
barrel which is really cool and I'm kind

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.130 
barrel which is really cool and I'm kind
of<00:02:27.890> curious<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.310> see<00:02:28.340> how<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.790> does<00:02:28.969> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
of curious to see how it does that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.059 
of curious to see how it does that
probably<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> same<00:02:30.409> way<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.769> ruffcut

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
probably the same way that the ruffcut

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.449 
probably the same way that the ruffcut
does<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.650> being<00:02:33.769> said<00:02:33.859> I'm<00:02:34.280> gonna

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
sake of time there were only four of

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.720 
sake of time there were only four of
them<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:47.269> on<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> bottom<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> bottom<00:02:49.639> of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
them here on the bottom at the bottom of

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.789 
them here on the bottom at the bottom of
the<00:02:49.790> plunger<00:02:50.090> tube<00:02:50.269> now<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.409> jolt

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
the plunger tube now just like the jolt

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.309 
the plunger tube now just like the jolt
the<00:02:52.189> handle<00:02:52.849> itself<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.810> plunger<00:02:54.139> tube

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
the handle itself is the plunger tube

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.720 
the handle itself is the plunger tube
and<00:02:54.909> we<00:02:55.909> have<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.359> plunger<00:02:56.930> head<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.579> out

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
and we have the plunger head and get out

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.819 
and we have the plunger head and get out
one<00:02:58.970> hand<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:02.109> looks<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.260> lot<00:03:03.530> like

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
one hand right here looks a lot like

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.339 
one hand right here looks a lot like
what<00:03:04.189> the<00:03:04.340> jolt<00:03:04.579> had<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:04.909> the<00:03:05.000> inside<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
what the jolt had on the inside the

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.940 
what the jolt had on the inside the
spring<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:06.980> pretty<00:03:07.579> beefy<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:09.560> one<00:03:09.739> hand

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
spring is pretty beefy it's one hand

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.319 
spring is pretty beefy it's one hand
this<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> bit<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.609> challenge<00:03:10.849> to<00:03:11.150> get<00:03:11.299> it

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
this is a bit of a challenge to get it

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.559 
this is a bit of a challenge to get it
to<00:03:11.480> compress<00:03:12.549> but<00:03:13.549> it's<00:03:13.849> it's<00:03:14.150> pretty<00:03:14.359> beefy

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
to compress but it's it's pretty beefy

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.949 
to compress but it's it's pretty beefy
and<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.889> definitely<00:03:16.689> stronger<00:03:17.689> than<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.870> was

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
and it's definitely stronger than I was

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.909 
and it's definitely stronger than I was
expecting<00:03:18.079> it<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.470> heads<00:03:21.650> got<00:03:21.889> a

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
expecting it to be and the heads got a

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.920 
expecting it to be and the heads got a
good<00:03:22.129> seal<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.579> like<00:03:22.699> with<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.909> tool<00:03:23.120> if<00:03:23.690> you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
good seal just like with the tool if you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.390 
good seal just like with the tool if you
guys<00:03:24.319> are<00:03:24.500> able<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.709> see<00:03:24.859> in<00:03:24.949> there<00:03:25.069> not<00:03:25.250> sure

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
guys are able to see in there not sure

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.710 
guys are able to see in there not sure
if<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.549> will<00:03:25.669> let<00:03:25.849> me<00:03:25.909> try<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.329> if<00:03:26.479> I<00:03:26.540> can

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
if you will let me try to see if I can

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.280 
if you will let me try to see if I can
move<00:03:27.229> this<00:03:27.290> thing<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> get<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.889> light<00:03:28.099> better

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
move this thing to get the light better

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.009 
move this thing to get the light better
just<00:03:30.290> barely<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:30.829> them<00:03:30.979> that<00:03:31.069> there's<00:03:31.489> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
just barely see them that there's a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.530 
just barely see them that there's a
little<00:03:33.019> bit<00:03:33.139> of<00:03:33.229> what<00:03:33.470> looks<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:33.829> a<00:03:34.510> bit<00:03:35.510> of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
little bit of what looks like a bit of

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.430 
little bit of what looks like a bit of
padding

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.789 

sike<00:03:39.440> was<00:03:39.769> quick<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.159> point<00:03:40.280> out<00:03:40.639> on<00:03:41.229> the<00:03:42.229> rough

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
sike was quick to point out on the rough

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.069 
sike was quick to point out on the rough
cut<00:03:43.099> that<00:03:43.760> there<00:03:43.970> was<00:03:44.150> padding<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.989> the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
cut that there was padding on the

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.339 
cut that there was padding on the
plunger<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:46.069> wasn't<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.489> rough<00:03:46.639> cut<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:47.349> think

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
plunger it wasn't the rough cut I think

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.009 
plunger it wasn't the rough cut I think
it<00:03:48.440> was<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> rough<00:03:48.739> cut<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:50.120> watched<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.720> lot<00:03:50.870> of

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
it was a rough cut I watched a lot of

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.349 
it was a rough cut I watched a lot of
nerve<00:03:51.139> videos<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> last<00:03:51.709> couple<00:03:51.979> of<00:03:52.010> days<00:03:52.359> and

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
nerve videos the last couple of days and

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.699 
nerve videos the last couple of days and
there's<00:03:53.599> some<00:03:53.750> padding<00:03:54.109> down<00:03:54.229> in<00:03:54.409> there<00:03:54.560> just

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
there's some padding down in there just

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.170 
there's some padding down in there just
like<00:03:54.799> on<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.099> rough<00:03:55.250> cut<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:55.549> I'm<00:03:55.639> interested

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
like on the rough cut so I'm interested

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.789 
like on the rough cut so I'm interested
if<00:03:56.269> nerf<00:03:56.599> is<00:03:56.810> kind<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.109> taking<00:03:57.409> a<00:03:57.500> cue<00:03:57.769> from

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
if nerf is kind of taking a cue from

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.839 
if nerf is kind of taking a cue from
modders<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.900> trying<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.169> help<00:04:01.040> lengthen<00:04:01.430> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
longevity of their blasters sadly this

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.189 
longevity of their blasters sadly this
is<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.489> most<00:04:04.909> open<00:04:05.329> that<00:04:05.629> I'm<00:04:05.750> willing<00:04:06.169> to

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
is the most open that I'm willing to

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.170 
is the most open that I'm willing to
crack<00:04:06.859> this<00:04:07.010> bad<00:04:07.220> boy<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.579> don't<00:04:07.639> really<00:04:07.970> want

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
crack this bad boy I don't really want

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.659 
crack this bad boy I don't really want
to<00:04:08.299> destroy<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.930> get<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:09.829> internal

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
to destroy it to get to the internal

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.710 
to destroy it to get to the internal
workings<00:04:11.000> up<00:04:11.180> here<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:13.419> yeah<00:04:14.419> that's<00:04:14.540> what

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
workings up here but yeah that's what

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120 
workings up here but yeah that's what
the<00:04:14.840> internals<00:04:15.229> look<00:04:15.259> like<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.769> as<00:04:15.919> I<00:04:16.039> was

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
the internals look like and as I was

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860 
the internals look like and as I was
saying<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:16.609> notice<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.659> catch

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
saying you can notice that the the catch

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.089 
saying you can notice that the the catch
goes<00:04:18.199> all<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.500> way<00:04:18.590> down<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.919> trigger

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
goes all the way down the trigger

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.189 
goes all the way down the trigger
there's<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.239> catch<00:04:20.389> mechanism<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.049> for

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
there's the catch mechanism and for

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.089 
there's the catch mechanism and for
those<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.530> who<00:04:21.650> are<00:04:21.739> trying<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.979> figure

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
those of you who are trying to figure

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.339 
those of you who are trying to figure
out<00:04:22.190> exactly<00:04:22.370> how<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.699> works<00:04:22.909> see<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.990> lip

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
out exactly how that works see that lip

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.220 
out exactly how that works see that lip
around<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.460> edge<00:04:25.520> there<00:04:25.909> the<00:04:26.240> catch<00:04:26.479> actually

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
around the edge there the catch actually

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.900 
around the edge there the catch actually
he<00:04:27.380> catches<00:04:27.680> on<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.820> name

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
he catches on to that just like the name

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.270 
he catches on to that just like the name
implies<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.510> when<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.440> pull<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> trigger

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
implies and when you pull the trigger

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.260 
implies and when you pull the trigger
the<00:04:31.610> whole<00:04:32.420> thing<00:04:32.660> works<00:04:32.900> like<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.170> lever<00:04:34.270> you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
the whole thing works like a lever you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.230 
the whole thing works like a lever you
see<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.600> orange<00:04:36.020> popping<00:04:36.500> out<00:04:36.620> there

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
see the orange popping out there

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.820 
see the orange popping out there
it<00:04:38.240> actually<00:04:38.420> works<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.050> lever<00:04:39.260> releases

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
it actually works like a lever releases

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.630 
it actually works like a lever releases
the<00:04:39.980> thing<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.210> spring<00:04:41.510> causes<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.640> you

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
the thing and the spring causes the you

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.180 
the thing and the spring causes the you
know<00:04:43.760> hole<00:04:44.060> plunger<00:04:44.450> head<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.810> push<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:46.010> air

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
know hole plunger head to push the air

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.980 
know hole plunger head to push the air
up<00:04:46.460> into<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.730> tube<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.090> fire<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> darts<00:04:47.540> now

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
up into the tube and fire the darts now

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.510 
up into the tube and fire the darts now
I<00:04:48.020> obviously<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.890> can't<00:04:49.070> crack<00:04:49.220> this<00:04:49.340> open

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
I obviously I can't crack this open

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.160 
I obviously I can't crack this open
anymore<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.210> can't<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.540> how<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.750> does<00:04:51.050> the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
anymore so I can't see how it does the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.560 
anymore so I can't see how it does the
whole<00:04:51.200> dart<00:04:51.530> detection<00:04:51.950> I'm<00:04:52.730> gonna<00:04:52.910> close

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
whole dart detection I'm gonna close

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.030 
whole dart detection I'm gonna close
back<00:04:53.840> up<00:04:54.050> now<00:04:54.200> though<00:04:54.410> I'm<00:04:54.590> going<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.830> give<00:04:54.950> you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
back up now though I'm going to give you

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.620 
back up now though I'm going to give you
my<00:04:55.190> final<00:04:55.340> thoughts<00:04:55.700> on<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.210> I'm<00:04:56.540> gonna

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
my final thoughts on it and I'm gonna

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.420 
my final thoughts on it and I'm gonna
answer<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.050> question<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.680> many<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.370> are

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.740 
answer the question that many of you are
probably<00:04:58.670> thinking<00:04:59.030> right<00:04:59.420> now<00:04:59.450> as<00:04:59.720> to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
probably thinking right now as to

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.560 
probably thinking right now as to
whether<00:05:00.080> or<00:05:00.200> not<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:01.100> should<00:05:01.880> replace<00:05:02.210> all

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
whether or not this should replace all

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:20.230 
whether or not this should replace all
of<00:05:02.780> your<00:05:02.990> jolts

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.420 

all<00:05:20.750> right<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.050> final<00:05:21.380> thoughts<00:05:21.620> on<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.449> Triad

all right so final thoughts on the Triad

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.010 
all right so final thoughts on the Triad
so<00:05:25.430> pretty<00:05:25.669> great<00:05:25.880> blaster<00:05:26.270> really

so pretty great blaster really

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.779 
so pretty great blaster really
comfortable<00:05:27.350> to<00:05:27.470> use<00:05:27.650> great<00:05:28.100> range<00:05:28.400> great

by<00:05:46.160> continuing<00:05:46.970> on<00:05:47.120> with<00:05:47.360> my<00:05:47.539> explanation<00:05:48.020> of

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
by continuing on with my explanation of

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.450 
by continuing on with my explanation of
why<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.810> jolt<00:05:51.080> has<00:05:51.319> one<00:05:51.710> great<00:05:52.220> thing<00:05:52.430> going

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
why the jolt has one great thing going

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.330 
why the jolt has one great thing going
for<00:05:52.849> it<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.240> is<00:05:53.389> its<00:05:53.630> size<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.949> jolt<00:05:55.190> is

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
for it and that is its size the jolt is

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.310 
for it and that is its size the jolt is

your backpack still but it is still as I
said<00:06:05.870> quite<00:06:06.410> a<00:06:06.500> bit<00:06:06.650> larger<00:06:07.990> that's<00:06:08.990> what<00:06:09.169> the

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
said quite a bit larger that's what the

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.390 
said quite a bit larger that's what the
jolt<00:06:09.470> has<00:06:09.650> going<00:06:09.860> for<00:06:09.949> it<00:06:10.160> over<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.550> triad<00:06:10.990> the

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
jolt has going for it over the triad the

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.649 
jolt has going for it over the triad the
Triads<00:06:13.400> a<00:06:13.430> little<00:06:13.610> bit<00:06:13.699> more<00:06:13.789> powerful<00:06:14.180> as<00:06:14.300> an

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659 
Triads a little bit more powerful as an

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.680 
Triads a little bit more powerful as an
elite<00:06:14.870> but<00:06:15.020> we're<00:06:15.169> getting<00:06:15.349> an<00:06:15.440> elite<00:06:15.680> jolt

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
elite but we're getting an elite jolt

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.719 
elite but we're getting an elite jolt
later<00:06:18.490> so<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:20.120> power<00:06:20.330> will<00:06:20.479> be<00:06:20.509> negated<00:06:21.729> the

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
later so the power will be negated the

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.580 
later so the power will be negated the
benefits<00:06:23.270> of<00:06:23.479> having<00:06:23.599> a<00:06:23.810> triad<00:06:24.110> obviously

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
benefits of having a triad obviously

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.730 
benefits of having a triad obviously
you've<00:06:24.710> got<00:06:24.740> greater<00:06:25.210> ammo<00:06:26.210> capacity<00:06:26.740> than

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
you've got greater ammo capacity than

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.140 
you've got greater ammo capacity than
with<00:06:27.919> the<00:06:28.009> jolt<00:06:28.250> both<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.639> jolt<00:06:28.849> you've<00:06:29.000> got

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
with the jolt both the jolt you've got

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.339 
with the jolt both the jolt you've got
the<00:06:29.270> size<00:06:29.449> so<00:06:30.110> if<00:06:31.659> size<00:06:32.659> doesn't<00:06:32.960> matter<00:06:33.139> to

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
the size so if size doesn't matter to

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.320 
the size so if size doesn't matter to
you<00:06:33.470> and<00:06:33.680> you<00:06:33.800> just<00:06:34.009> kind<00:06:34.340> of<00:06:34.370> want<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.880> tiny
