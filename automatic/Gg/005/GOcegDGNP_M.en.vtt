that at every age and for every person
human<00:00:26.869> growth<00:00:27.050> hormone<00:00:27.440> has<00:00:27.619> an<00:00:27.830> effect<00:00:28.250> we

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
human growth hormone has an effect we

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.720 
human growth hormone has an effect we
see<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:29.660> often<00:00:30.199> being<00:00:30.740> used<00:00:30.830> in<00:00:31.189> our<00:00:31.310> children

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
see it often being used in our children

concerns about muscle development would

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520 
concerns about muscle development would
have<00:00:49.640> given<00:00:49.969> human<00:00:50.270> growth<00:00:50.600> hormone<00:00:50.989> the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
have given human growth hormone the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.889 
have given human growth hormone the
injuries<00:00:51.890> heal<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.399> 50%<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.360> time<00:00:53.570> that

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
injuries heal and 50% of the time that

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.170 
injuries heal and 50% of the time that
normally<00:00:54.260> takes<00:00:54.500> muscles<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.070> heal<00:00:55.309> our

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
normally takes muscles to heal our

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.520 
normally takes muscles to heal our
middle-aged<00:00:56.629> individuals

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
middle-aged individuals

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.000 
middle-aged individuals
40<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:58.190> 60<00:00:58.579> these<00:00:59.120> individuals<00:00:59.750> also<00:01:00.289> benefit

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
40 to 60 these individuals also benefit

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.830 
40 to 60 these individuals also benefit
from<00:01:01.039> human<00:01:01.579> growth<00:01:01.760> hormone<00:01:02.120> because<00:01:02.360> by<00:01:02.660> age

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
from human growth hormone because by age

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.550 
from human growth hormone because by age
40<00:01:03.379> 80%<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:04.549> our<00:01:04.610> native<00:01:05.269> production<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.289> human

40 80% of our native production of human

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.330 
40 80% of our native production of human
growth<00:01:06.710> Herman<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.159> gone<00:01:07.369> by<00:01:07.639> 50<00:01:08.029> it's<00:01:08.270> all

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
growth Herman is gone by 50 it's all

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.669 
growth Herman is gone by 50 it's all
dissipated<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:10.459> what<00:01:11.359> we<00:01:11.509> need<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:11.869> do<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.409> to

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
dissipated so what we need to do is to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.699 
dissipated so what we need to do is to
look<00:01:12.920> at<00:01:13.420> how<00:01:14.420> human<00:01:14.869> growth<00:01:15.020> hormone<00:01:15.350> affects

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
look at how human growth hormone affects

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.289 
look at how human growth hormone affects
each<00:01:15.979> group<00:01:17.079> lastly<00:01:18.520> not<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.729> ignore<00:01:20.270> our

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
each group lastly not to ignore our

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.769 
each group lastly not to ignore our
seniors<00:01:20.840> individuals<00:01:21.799> over<00:01:22.069> 60<00:01:22.429> are<00:01:22.689> able<00:01:23.689> to

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
seniors individuals over 60 are able to

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.300 
seniors individuals over 60 are able to
use<00:01:23.929> human<00:01:24.170> human<00:01:24.469> growth<00:01:24.649> hormone<00:01:25.009> to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
use human human growth hormone to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.940 
use human human growth hormone to
maintain<00:01:25.789> their<00:01:25.939> independence<00:01:26.289> they<00:01:27.289> do<00:01:27.799> not

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
maintain their independence they do not

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.529 
maintain their independence they do not
have<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.249> have<00:01:28.369> caregivers<00:01:28.639> and<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:29.359> can

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
have to have caregivers and they can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.249 
have to have caregivers and they can
delay<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:31.779> complications<00:01:32.779> of<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:32.990> aging

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
delay the complications of the aging

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.379 
delay the complications of the aging
process<00:01:33.380> by<00:01:33.919> as<00:01:34.069> much<00:01:34.219> as<00:01:34.459> 10<00:01:34.849> to<00:01:34.999> 15<00:01:35.359> years

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
process by as much as 10 to 15 years

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.649 
process by as much as 10 to 15 years
maybe<00:01:35.990> 20<00:01:36.439> years<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.179> answer<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.569> the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
maybe 20 years so the answer to the

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.149 
maybe 20 years so the answer to the
question<00:01:38.990> does<00:01:39.139> human<00:01:39.439> growth<00:01:39.619> hormone<00:01:39.950> work

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
question does human growth hormone work

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.489 
question does human growth hormone work
yes<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:40.999> does<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.509> affects<00:01:41.779> every<00:01:42.049> system<00:01:42.380> of

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
yes it does it affects every system of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.639 
yes it does it affects every system of
our<00:01:42.649> body<00:01:42.819> it<00:01:43.819> affects<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.270> brain<00:01:44.389> it<00:01:44.959> affects
