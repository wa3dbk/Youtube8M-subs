00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
minutes because it takes that long for

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.569 
minutes because it takes that long for
the<00:03:01.019> amino<00:03:02.019> acids<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.709> soak<00:03:02.920> into<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.310> bait

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
the amino acids to soak into the bait

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.089 
the amino acids to soak into the bait
and<00:03:04.359> then<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.780> want<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.170> apply<00:03:05.470> even<00:03:05.859> more
