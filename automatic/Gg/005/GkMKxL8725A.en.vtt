are pretty heavy-duty and as you can see

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.950 
are pretty heavy-duty and as you can see
I<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.930> easily<00:02:15.430> pick<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.610> case<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.150> no

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
I can easily pick this case up no

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.230 
I can easily pick this case up no
problem<00:02:18.280> whatsoever<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:19.940> made<00:02:20.120> to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
problem whatsoever I'm it's made to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.810 
problem whatsoever I'm it's made to
again<00:02:20.660> look<00:02:20.900> like<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.440> ammo<00:02:22.130> box<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.700> is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
again look like a ammo box so this is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.120 
again look like a ammo box so this is
how<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:22.970> guess<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.930> know<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.530> handles<00:02:24.920> are<00:02:25.040> on

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
how I guess you know the handles are on

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
how I guess you know the handles are on
those<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.820> know<00:02:25.910> easy<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.330> pick<00:02:26.510> up<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:26.690> once

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
those you know easy to pick up but once

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.540 
those you know easy to pick up but once
you<00:02:27.050> have<00:02:27.170> everything<00:02:27.260> installed<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.280> still

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
you have everything installed you still

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.650 
you have everything installed you still
should<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.760> able<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.970> use<00:02:29.060> these<00:02:29.180> handles<00:02:29.480> to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
should be able to use these handles to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.630 
should be able to use these handles to
carry<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.110> case<00:02:30.290> around<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:31.160> also<00:02:31.340> have

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
carry the case around and you also have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.100 
carry the case around and you also have
these<00:02:31.820> locks<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:32.870> which<00:02:33.020> are

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.730 
actually for the side panels which we're
going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.030> get<00:02:35.120> into<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.170> one<00:02:36.350> second

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
ground so you know air can easily flow

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.360 
ground so you know air can easily flow

in and out of your tapes all right now
it's<00:02:58.550> time<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.270> inside<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.930> case<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.380> this

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's time to get inside the case in this

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250 
it's time to get inside the case in this
case<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:01.250> unlike<00:03:01.490> most<00:03:02.060> as<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.810> does<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.080> have

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
case is unlike most as it does not have

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.840 
case is unlike most as it does not have
any<00:03:03.380> screws<00:03:03.740> on<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> side<00:03:04.250> panels<00:03:04.610> they're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
any screws on the side panels they're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.910 
any screws on the side panels they're
actually<00:03:05.240> held<00:03:05.480> into<00:03:05.660> place<00:03:05.690> by<00:03:05.900> these<00:03:06.500> two

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
actually held into place by these two

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.370 
actually held into place by these two
locks<00:03:07.220> right<00:03:07.430> here<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.420> get<00:03:08.870> inside<00:03:09.200> it's

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
locks right here and to get inside it's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.380 
locks right here and to get inside it's
very<00:03:09.620> easy<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.220> unlock<00:03:10.610> each<00:03:10.790> one<00:03:11.060> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
very easy to just unlock each one and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.449 
very easy to just unlock each one and
they<00:03:12.080> are<00:03:12.260> pretty<00:03:12.560> strong<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.280> have<00:03:13.400> to

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
they are pretty strong so you have to

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.530 
they are pretty strong so you have to
put<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> little<00:03:13.670> bit<00:03:13.820> pressure<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
put a little bit pressure on there and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.620 
put a little bit pressure on there and
then<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.230> can<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.590> easily<00:03:16.360> unlock<00:03:17.360> them<00:03:17.540> up

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
then you can just easily unlock them up

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050 
then you can just easily unlock them up
top<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.410> easily<00:03:18.980> take<00:03:19.250> your<00:03:19.400> side<00:03:19.640> panel<00:03:19.970> on

top and easily take your side panel on
right<00:03:20.360> there<00:03:20.570> now<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.800> we<00:03:21.920> are<00:03:22.100> inside<00:03:22.340> you

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
right there now that we are inside you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.990 
right there now that we are inside you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.160 
routing hooks here and you can easily
unhook<00:05:07.670> them<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.090> router<00:05:08.540> your<00:05:08.690> cables<00:05:09.020> and

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
unhook them and router your cables and

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.260 
unhook them and router your cables and
then<00:05:09.320> connect<00:05:10.010> them<00:05:10.130> back<00:05:10.280> just<00:05:10.550> as<00:05:10.820> easily<00:05:11.030> so

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
then connect them back just as easily so

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.090 
then connect them back just as easily so
you<00:05:11.330> have<00:05:11.480> all<00:05:11.630> your<00:05:11.750> cables<00:05:11.900> routed<00:05:12.830> very

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
you have all your cables routed very

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.000 
you have all your cables routed very
nicely<00:05:13.400> very<00:05:13.910> uniformly<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.140> everything

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
nicely very uniformly and everything

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.030 
nicely very uniformly and everything
like<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.250> there<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.630> very<00:05:17.990> large<00:05:18.290> CPU

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
like that there is a very large CPU

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.460 
like that there is a very large CPU
power<00:05:19.250> cable<00:05:19.669> cut<00:05:19.850> up<00:05:19.970> up<00:05:20.180> here<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:21.020> really

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
power cable cut up up here and I really

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.860 
power cable cut up up here and I really
like<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.890> because<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:23.060> many<00:05:23.180> cases<00:05:23.660> have

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
like this because so many cases have

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.240 
like this because so many cases have
this<00:05:24.080> opening<00:05:24.590> right<00:05:24.710> here<00:05:24.800> but<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:25.190> very

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
this opening right here but it's very

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.000 
this opening right here but it's very
very<00:05:25.790> small<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.450> it's<00:05:26.870> very<00:05:27.200> hard<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:27.890> get

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
very small and it's very hard to get

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.460 
very small and it's very hard to get
your<00:05:28.190> CPU<00:05:28.700> power<00:05:29.090> cable<00:05:29.510> through<00:05:29.810> there<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.260> I

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
your CPU power cable through there so I

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.770 
your CPU power cable through there so I
really<00:05:30.980> like<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.340> one<00:05:32.240> last<00:05:32.450> thing<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.750> note

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
really like that one last thing to note

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.080 
really like that one last thing to note
there<00:05:33.140> is<00:05:33.410> quite<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.070> lot<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.340> space<00:05:34.490> behind

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
there is quite a lot of space behind

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.730 
there is quite a lot of space behind
your<00:05:35.270> motherboard<00:05:35.780> tray<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.470> you're<00:05:36.620> gonna

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
your motherboard tray so you're gonna

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.500 
your motherboard tray so you're gonna
have<00:05:36.919> no<00:05:37.130> problem<00:05:37.580> routing<00:05:37.880> your<00:05:37.970> cables<00:05:38.330> and

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
have no problem routing your cables and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.870 
have no problem routing your cables and
getting<00:05:39.020> your<00:05:39.200> extra<00:05:39.800> side<00:05:40.370> panel<00:05:40.730> to

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
getting your extra side panel to

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.000 
getting your extra side panel to
actually<00:05:41.330> come<00:05:41.630> back<00:05:41.660> on<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.350> know<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.680> lot<00:05:42.890> of

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
actually come back on I know a lot of

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.560 
actually come back on I know a lot of
times<00:05:43.190> there<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:43.430> some<00:05:43.880> room<00:05:44.060> back<00:05:44.240> here

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
times there is some room back here

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.420 
times there is some room back here
but<00:05:45.020> when<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.290> go<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.470> put<00:05:45.680> that<00:05:45.830> side<00:05:46.070> panel

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
but when you go to put that side panel

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.490 
but when you go to put that side panel
on<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.790> is<00:05:46.910> very<00:05:47.450> very<00:05:47.750> hard<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.290> you<00:05:48.350> know

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
on it is very very hard and you know

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.680 
on it is very very hard and you know
bending<00:05:48.919> cables<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.550> things<00:05:50.090> like<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.330> so

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
bending cables and things like that so

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.050 
bending cables and things like that so
that<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.350> about<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.680> for<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.550> Corsair

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
that is about it for the Corsair

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.409 
that is about it for the Corsair
