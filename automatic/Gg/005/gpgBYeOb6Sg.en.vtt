00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
chance ok Murray usually starts slow so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.550 
chance ok Murray usually starts slow so
I<00:04:19.930> think<00:04:20.080> he<00:04:20.979> should<00:04:21.250> meet<00:04:21.729> person<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> think

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I think he should meet person I think

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.680 
I think he should meet person I think
take<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.889> different<00:04:23.130> approach<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.820> come<00:04:24.510> out

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
take a different approach and come out

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
take a different approach and come out
quickly<00:04:25.070> because<00:04:26.070> he<00:04:26.280> needs<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.910> gain

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
