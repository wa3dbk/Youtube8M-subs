00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.700
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.580
 video today we're going to talk about a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.160
 somewhat special application because it's worth 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.400
 for android voucher for mac voucher for 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.730
 windows and voucher for devices with 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.169
 them like the ipad or the iphone in the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.290
 case that concerns us we are going to use it 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.710
 from a macbook air as we see in the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.750
 bottom right of the video and with 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.360
 an android tablet like the asus 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.149
 transformer is to say that the macbook air 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.180
 is connected to a Wi-Fi network the same 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.270
 that transforms them and that through that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.460
 link we will be able to use a 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.610
 tablet as we say an android tablet a 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.160
 ipad an iphone or an android mobile like 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.020
 second screen because it's interesting 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.790
 this then to begin with because we can 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 use two monitors simply 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.870
 having the tablet next we can 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.519
 use it horizontally vertically and to 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.960
 that you just have to install the small 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.990
 application of which we speak today that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.720
 flame eye display in the marq appears the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.600
 upper part 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.800
 in the options we have in the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 connected devices 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.820
 the asus transformer we can update 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.070
 we can simply mode 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.320
 vision is to say the tablet right now 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.420
 is operational in the sense that 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 we can touch the screen and interact 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 with the mac osx operating system that is 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.770
 the one that uses mounts and layÃºn in this 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.660
 case that is the one that uses the mac but 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.390
 let's go a little further we're going to connect 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.180
 we have connected the android tablet by 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.260
 hdmi to a television as you see 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.470
 replicates what we see on the tablet as well 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.740
 we have a monitor on the computer 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.380
 and a second monitor on television 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.510
 we can even simply make a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.090
 replication this is something very similar to what 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.280
 that already has apple with air view but what 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.070
 interesting from this eye application 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.649
 display is interoperability we can 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.070
 do it from mac android windows to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.810
 Android windows or ipad and of course 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.140
 from mac to them with ipad or iphone 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.940
 as we say 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.940
 We can see 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.070
 both the two monitors 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.970
 you see that it has a little bit of lag 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.770
 and this is not operational to replace 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.460
 For example, operations with 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.290
 writing and maybe editing not but yes 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.560
 to watch movies to have 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 something very common that is the customer of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.790
 twitter as you can see we can pass it from a 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.680
 monitor another right now we do not have the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.110
 second monitor that is television and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.950
 now enter the del 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.950
 computer 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.140
 We can not leave here 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.900
 and if we move to another room because 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.400
 we simply have more options 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.079
 right now we are controlling the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.950
 second monitor that is television or 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.950
 the tablet that I myself 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.780
 we can open a video 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.140
 or pass it 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.170
 to the TV 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.239
 and we have left 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.819
 As you can see, it 's quite comfortable, it's a 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.319
 Free application for the customer of 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:07.010
 mac or windows desk and payment for 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.989
 the clients of android or of iphone already 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.720
 josh in the case of android is the one 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.970
 we are using it costs five dollars 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 is somewhat higher than normal but the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.709
 truth is that it gives a comfort and a 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.829
 ease of use that is worth the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.199
 payment is something similar to exploded 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.270
 remote that we already analyzed in the blog 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.550
 time but it does not exactly have the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.840
 same functionality if you have any 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.960
 doubt you already know that you can not leave a 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.490
 comment in the video's own post or 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.490
 in the youtube channel a greeting
