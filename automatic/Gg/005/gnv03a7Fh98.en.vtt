00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.910
 greet you dear friends with you 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.490
 remix in this issue will discuss this 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.710
 unpleasant things like abilka creatures are smart 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.440
 liver with aspen manticores 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.540
 poisoning and animal from probably every 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.970
 the player knows firsthand what it is 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.310
 as not lost and avid valuable 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.350
 Creatures the most a shame that hard something 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.120
 do against this ability 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.379
 but we will try to disassemble the complex 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.050
 how to fight it 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.510
 for starters about the ability itself 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.120
 assassin poisoning which causes one 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.809
 damage unit per 1 assassin for 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.850
 three moves 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.769
 damage amount is easy to calculate 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.739
 how many assassins so much damage will be 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.589
 getting the enemy being coming on 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.269
 decor and put on 4 units per creature 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.789
 also for three turns 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.269
 and the animal from the dark right poisons 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.609
 enemy creatures by 5 units for 1 true 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.149
 this way before the battle you can easily 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.889
 to calculate 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.430
 damage that you can do with 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:09.940
 poison let's start by noting the pros and 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.950
 cons of poisoning pros firstly not poison 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.290
 depends on the protection of creatures and other 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.660
 abilities secondly it is a pleasant 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.580
 addition to the main attack and in the case of 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.130
 Assassins are also remote 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.380
 third sending station since this 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 Abilka does not affect her magical 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.090
 resistance so we anyway 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.710
 We can infect your opponent what 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.540
 the same minuses possessing this ability 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.340
 minus only one thing that she doesn't 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.370
 acts on undead mechanisms and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.500
 elementals 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.240
 so if there are creatures in your army 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 with this fork before the battle with the undead 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.410
 better overheat them now let's see 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 how to resist creatures with 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.210
 poisoning to reduce damage from the poison will 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.370
 spell heavenly shield about which I already 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.560
 spoke last video here i will leave 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.930
 link and you can watch it to me 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.670
 skillful level allows us to reduce 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.890
 fifty percent damage from years 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 let's now see what else besides 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.750
 heavenly accounts will be able to take it off 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.610
 spell 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 enemy hero with assassins we 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.200
 attack our hero as seen by 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.970
 scale initiative all assassins distill 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.979
 creatures carly so we can 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.470
 safely poison and check everyone 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.540
 than you can remove this ability and what is not for 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.050
 started our tent which is on 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 artificial 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.280
 machine control level treats 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.250
 the harpooner of and safely removes it I 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 very well then throw regeneration 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.660
 suddenly she can help us 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.680
 but not all positive negative 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.600
 effects still affect adepts 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.880
 further paladins we use 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.930
 ability to lay hands 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.930
 dysfunctional take off control 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.800
 angels if someone thought that 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.050
 resurrection can be removed I rush you 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.910
 grieve it is not removed in this way 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.010
 exorcism runes also don't work 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.709
 just not pressed next skip 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.840
 moves up to our hero as you can see 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:12.040
 charms put no one can suddenly us 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 anti-magic will help and fail again 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 counter this harmful ability 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.890
 adepts also can not hit their 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.989
 to use cleansing but also on 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.900
 the sweetest we leave vampirism he 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.459
 makes us during the spell 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.350
 undead therefore damage from poison should not 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.180
 go the way it is and the last 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.430
 our favorite way is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 heavenly damage reduction 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.110
 which absorbs 50 percent damage and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.110
 he safely removes 50 percent 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.900
 Manticore possess exactly the same a 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.600
 fork with a difference in damage 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.700
 if the assassin was worn one by one 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.400
 damage per creature by manticore 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.410
 deals 4 units of poison each and every one 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.110
 methods of treatment data abilities 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.550
 similar to the past pieces of video which 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.060
 all the same interesting creatures 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.920
 Manticore so much green just 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.960
 shocking but let's check how 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 you can remove the animal from the wyvern poison 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.150
 paladin tent copes with 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.440
 removing the direction we go with all the fans 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.060
 in order to infect as much as possible 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.799
 more units if imposed 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.190
 vampirism after we are poisoned 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.560
 hiding is not taken off for you 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.530
 works further just skip the moves and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.180
 dark 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.180
 do not infect everything that just moves 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.150
 and the resurrection of antimagic is still not 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.150
 works 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.250
 further we look at drivers and fleece of gray 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.290
 colors i.e. it cannot be activated 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.210
 means and remove the series is not necessary and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.430
 finally, the sky shield is fine 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.180
 doing its job and using 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.280
 laying hands 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.920
 we have a beautiful display lim this ability 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.740
 let's summarize our video we 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.410
 found out that the animals are yak and poisoning by 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.230
 Essentially the same thing is also removed by her and 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.780
 in the same way but the difference is 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.820
 damage caused by this poison is 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.920
 way tent laying hands on 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.960
 empiricism before poison is applied 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.390
 helps us avoid poisoning 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.730
 sky shield helps reduce damage from 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.550
 poison and vampirism after application 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.220
 poisoning removal spell antimagiya smooth 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.800
 exorcism of cleansing and resurrection 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.720
 does not help us in this case and in the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.910
 this is our release coming to an end 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.919
 use everything that looked in this 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.200
 video when the poison is not so 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.330
 scary if you liked the video 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.120
