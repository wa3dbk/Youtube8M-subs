00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
 the mobile soja toaster of miller 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 technology 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.100
 this machine for thermal 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.180
 Preparation is for different 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 suitable feed 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.520
 because everything is installed on a low loader 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 was this machine works autonomously they 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 requires neither electricity nor gas connection 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 The feed can be harvested at harvest 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.980
 be processed directly on the field 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.899
 thanks to the mobile soya toaster is no longer necessary 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.629
 the expensive transport in far away 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.430
 soest facilities and the soy does not have to 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.430
 first loaded on trucks 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 GMO free is no problem 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.190
 more 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.140
 Therefore, the ideal for organic farms and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.980
 the regionality of the feed can 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.980
 be guaranteed 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.829
 The soybeans can be right after the 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.829
 crop to be tested on the spot 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
 located at the rear end of the machine 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 a height-adjustable grain 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 recording via a trailer or 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.820
 be sent with a counter for it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.290
 can 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.330
 the cereal intake will be 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 Product for control over a balance 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.600
 and continue to the monastery 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.520
 transported in the test facility is by means of 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 pager and hole bottom the product 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 evenly with a stream of hot air 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.070
 then the heated product is heated 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.539
 in a special sido promoted where it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.369
 for homogenization remains in the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.860
 The dogma is going to run 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.610
 Homogenization cooled and over a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 overflowing corner reloading the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.940
 Continuous operation can be done manually at any time 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.940
 on and off 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.290
 up to 25 tons per hour 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.930
 are processed 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 two mobile gas tanks are available for this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.090
 each 330 liters available 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.860
 different km h and one 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.760
 closed cabin for the operator 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.760
 are available as options 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.610
 more information about the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 production and sales of mobile 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.739
