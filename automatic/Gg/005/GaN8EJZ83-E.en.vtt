00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.250
 there is good condition, that is, one and 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.980
 recommending them I bring gameplay of 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.810
 modern warfare 3 low edom map 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.550
 confirmed that despite being one 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.930
 let's say it's a relatively 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.809
 short you know how good obviously 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.309
 the map and good can use a weapon 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.980
 that he always uses here 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.170
 the app 90 as you are going to see and I think that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.360
 is the weapon that I do not know what better comes 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.500
 for these cases with a 7 mind the 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.449
 put on it too but I do not know why 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.850
 I feel more played with this weapon like this 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.070
 close to design also points to 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.109
 main party as you are going to see how 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.359
 a kind of scuffle and then comes 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.890
 when the face always so the crap 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.329
 he has not stopped creating without leaving 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.909
 economic that I was leaving for not 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.769
 upload it and others but good nothing notice 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.530
 school about a couple of little things and what 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.839
 First of all, I do not know what you think 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.969
 to you but I think that whenever 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.429
 you make a video with other people 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.139
 whenever we say good yes I think that 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.789
 simply with making a video with another 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.739
 person apart from being alone 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.299
 obviously to see is your channel what can 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.059
 do but days every day 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.829
 videos with other people but I say that 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.720
 whenever you upload videos from here to me 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.670
 channel and as you know I always love 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 make videos with a lot of 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 people like pretty much all of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.470
 youtube and ended up making videos and I 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.780
 I passed super well super well super well and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.340
 then there is another point that is when you 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.320
 you meet with those people with whom 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.390
 you make videos we really have everything in 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.340
 person when for example as when 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.350
 comes to german gel or like when I saw by 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.289
 first time to this one 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 álex to preach to all these people that 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.580
 arrive that you already know and that but 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.409
 let's say the male or principle that does not 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.820
 it takes is giving the best with them 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.619
 every day a lot of others and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.649
 logically you meet him for the first 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.539
 you say like oysters like it gives you a 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.479
 little bit of shame I would say and also that 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.840
 I'm pretty shy, you know, it's like 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.640
 go then well let's not say that you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.770
 you feel like super weird after being 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 So much time talking to someone later 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.100
 really find the person though 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.369
 you have already seen pictures of how 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.789
 is etc. let's say it's not the same 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.549
 no and I believe that and image also to 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.789
 you when we are all together os 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.170
 you spend as much as it is good and either a 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.549
 video from a video blog or be it a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 game that he is playing with someone 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.860
 with another person 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.390
 I think that always that point is that in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.850
 The better I pass it, I'm recording 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 the video more like then to people I 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.130
 He says I had a great time in recording 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.920
 a video is' ​​practically 100% that 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.830
 then you will end up liking that video 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.080
 because you notice that good is not transmitted 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.540
 roll and I think that from here to nothing a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.330
 time I think we could see even 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.340
 this more often note 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.770
 that youtube has done that obviously 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.800
 let's know good we know each other 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.750
 all youtubers very much more and at 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 after all it's a way that you have 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.170
 to meet you with people, not in the end 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.970
 that look between normal but that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.739
 just good have a hobby in 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.920
 common with you that is uploading videos to 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.450
 youtube does not have anything more special 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.280
 so yes you obviously have a lot 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.570
 of time talking is not how to get to 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.190
 someone and find television in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.470
 people back then look what's wrong with me 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.150
 not never met anyone who 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.130
 have you said oysters lets talk a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.540
 bunch with someone on skype and then not 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.430
 when you know him in personal I 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.220
 I know it's a border or it's I do not know what 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.960
 truth is that has always led me 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.150
 impression that 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.250
 as I expected it and the truth is that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.440
 I do not know say it's not what happens 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.950
 you but when you watch videos with more 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.330
 people are just laughing good vibes and 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.010
 I think that that yes yes that 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.280
 transmits to you and I think so 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.440
 let's say it was a good roll to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.990
 video let's not say it's very entertaining 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.790
 and above all there are people who spend it very 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.710
 well I had a great time recording and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.410
 come on I imagine that the people with whom 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.120
 just record you will have a good time and 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.560
 as soon as I say how much better is it 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 happens to someone is as better than in the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.570
 videos you see in zombie videos with 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.130
 continued consumption and with álex the 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.680
 videos and the games that we created 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.200
 example the phone that recorded 5 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.450
 richard all the games you play 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.370
 with people in a game to crack with marc 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.260
 gené with the blonde or when the game of 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.600
 says is that you will see that they are 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.580
 playing with an álex and services that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.820
 are for the next few days have been 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.980
 the less epic that is, it has been a 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.050
 videos and I had a great time 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.270
 well and at the end of the day then you take 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.280
 You get to play yourself if you run from 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.020
 boredom no that is how it is that if 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.169
 I do not play with people, I do not have fun 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.650
 So I think that this shows 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.150
 it is quite noticeable and it is to say that everything 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.560
 this little world that has made it go 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.539
 to play online games that stops 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.159
 play multiplayer games with 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.580
 people is what has made the end and the 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.500
 out games are something social that already 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.690
 not so much of being alone playing 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.870
 what lion is playing then with all my 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.330
 friends but on the internet, not because if each 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.550
 background with your usual friends when to 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.900
 a game to the console whatever it is I think 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.270
 which is a change that yes to both 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.680
 the last years and although maybe 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.960
 even our parents do not finish 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.490
 understand but good and it's our turn to 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 we will not understand better in the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.680
 next generations to our children 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.389
 when I get transported to play 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.430
 neighbor's house play in a universe 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.080
 parallel I have no idea what 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.659
 that they will take out but any madness like that 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.909
 so well I had to comment the ones that 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.680
 this afternoon I'm going to do I'm going to do 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.529
