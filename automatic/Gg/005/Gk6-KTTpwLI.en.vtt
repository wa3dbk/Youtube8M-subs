the core area of the suit which is going
to<00:00:18.730> be<00:00:18.789> around<00:00:19.030> your<00:00:19.270> solver<00:00:19.600> growing<00:00:20.200> the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
to be around your solver growing the

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.470 
to be around your solver growing the
lower<00:00:20.470> part<00:00:20.770> of<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.890> suit<00:00:21.160> you<00:00:22.090> can<00:00:22.240> sort<00:00:22.330> of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
lower part of the suit you can sort of

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.320 
lower part of the suit you can sort of
see<00:00:22.630> that<00:00:22.920> quite<00:00:23.920> thick<00:00:24.190> on<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.369> ankle<00:00:25.119> round

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
see that quite thick on the ankle round

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.720 
see that quite thick on the ankle round
there<00:00:25.510> then<00:00:26.440> it<00:00:26.590> strategically<00:00:27.160> uses<00:00:27.610> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
there then it strategically uses the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.160 
there then it strategically uses the
thinner<00:00:28.000> neoprene<00:00:28.480> where<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.840> need<00:00:28.990> more

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
thinner neoprene where you need more

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.900 
thinner neoprene where you need more
flexibility<00:00:29.770> so<00:00:30.100> an<00:00:30.220> areas<00:00:30.520> like<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.760> upper

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
flexibility so an areas like the upper

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.180 
flexibility so an areas like the upper
body<00:00:30.940> is<00:00:31.300> going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.810> be<00:00:31.900> more<00:00:32.109> like<00:00:32.169> three<00:00:32.649> mil

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
body is going to be more like three mil

get into the suit and gives you more
flexibility<00:02:37.010> okay<00:02:38.170> that's<00:02:39.170> common<00:02:39.560> between

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
flexibility okay that's common between

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.800 
flexibility okay that's common between
the<00:02:40.130> heat<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.670> side<00:02:40.880> hooded<00:02:41.210> heat<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
the heat this side hooded heat and the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.380 
the heat this side hooded heat and the
normal<00:02:42.200> heat<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.640> by<00:02:43.640> having<00:02:43.790> said<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
normal heat and by having said that the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.380 
normal heat and by having said that the
key<00:02:44.540> difference<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:47.210> is<00:02:47.300> a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
key difference with this this is a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.820 
key difference with this this is a
version<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.960> heat<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> hooded<00:02:48.500> heat<00:02:48.650> is

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
version of the heat the hooded heat is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.070 
version of the heat the hooded heat is
obviously<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.820> hood<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.450> zip<00:02:50.660> system

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
obviously the hood and the zip system

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.440 
obviously the hood and the zip system
okay<00:02:51.520> swype<00:02:52.520> costs<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:52.940> bit<00:02:53.060> more<00:02:53.240> money

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
okay swype costs a little bit more money

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.780 
okay swype costs a little bit more money
okay<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.290> chest<00:02:54.530> zip<00:02:54.590> system<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:55.550> really

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
okay the chest zip system it's really

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.900 
okay the chest zip system it's really
straightforward<00:02:56.200> okay<00:02:57.310> bit<00:02:58.310> trickier<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> get

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
straightforward okay bit trickier to get

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.280 
straightforward okay bit trickier to get
in<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.180> out<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.480> work<00:02:59.720> suit<00:02:59.959> than<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
in and out of this work suit than the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.530 
in and out of this work suit than the
normal<00:03:00.560> back<00:03:00.740> zip<00:03:00.980> system<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.150> having<00:03:02.360> said

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
normal back zip system but having said

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.480 
normal back zip system but having said
that<00:03:02.600> that's<00:03:03.080> for<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.290> reason<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.950> makes<00:03:04.160> it

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
that that's for a reason it makes it

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.300 
that that's for a reason it makes it
means<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.060> suit<00:03:05.240> is<00:03:05.770> more<00:03:06.770> effectively

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
means that suit is more effectively

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.449 
means that suit is more effectively
sealed<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:08.300> let<00:03:08.480> less<00:03:08.690> water<00:03:08.959> okay<00:03:09.800> harder<00:03:10.430> to

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
sealed to let less water okay harder to

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.970 
sealed to let less water okay harder to
get<00:03:10.580> into<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.270> it's<00:03:11.810> harder<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.110> get<00:03:12.260> into<00:03:12.320> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
get into but it's harder to get into the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.920 
get into but it's harder to get into the
more<00:03:13.130> likelihood<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.850> going<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.540> harder

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
more likelihood it is going to be harder

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.270 
more likelihood it is going to be harder
for<00:03:14.959> water<00:03:15.260> actually<00:03:15.560> get<00:03:15.890> into<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.130> word

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
for water actually get into the word

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.120 
for water actually get into the word
suit<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:16.580> well<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.780> chest<00:03:18.230> up<00:03:18.380> them<00:03:18.709> then<00:03:18.890> as

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
suit as well the chest up them then as

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.340 
suit as well the chest up them then as
you<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.310> see<00:03:19.610> it's<00:03:20.120> basically<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.900> piece<00:03:21.320> of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
you can see it's basically a piece of

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.140 
you can see it's basically a piece of
neoprene<00:03:21.769> zone<00:03:22.070> over<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.310> top<00:03:22.580> of<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.880> suit

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
neoprene zone over the top of the suit

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.800 
neoprene zone over the top of the suit
with<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.989> hood<00:03:24.170> attached<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.950> am<00:03:25.820> basically

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
with the hood attached and am basically

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.509 
with the hood attached and am basically
if<00:03:27.140> any<00:03:27.350> water<00:03:27.530> comes<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:28.040> through<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> collar

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
if any water comes in through the collar

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.190 
if any water comes in through the collar
or<00:03:29.060> through<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.450> side<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.930> chest<00:03:30.110> zip

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
or through the side of the chest zip

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.140 
or through the side of the chest zip
system<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.920> then<00:03:31.130> has<00:03:31.160> these<00:03:31.489> drain<00:03:31.850> holes

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
system it then has these drain holes

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.449 
system it then has these drain holes
which<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.840> see<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.220> side<00:03:34.430> of

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
which you can see here on the side of

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.310 
which you can see here on the side of
the<00:03:34.610> elbow<00:03:34.910> there<00:03:35.690> should<00:03:35.870> be<00:03:35.959> one<00:03:36.140> at<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
the elbow there should be one at the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.009 
the elbow there should be one at the
back<00:03:36.470> as<00:03:36.709> well<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.820> let<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.060> water<00:03:38.269> out<00:03:38.480> so

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
back as well to let the water out so

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.479 
back as well to let the water out so
essentially<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.769> actually<00:03:40.100> put<00:03:40.280> onto

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
essentially this is actually put onto

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.970 
essentially this is actually put onto
the<00:03:40.730> top<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.390> existing<00:03:41.540> wetsuit<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.500> then

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
the top of the existing wetsuit and then

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.979 
the top of the existing wetsuit and then
everybody<00:03:43.340> water<00:03:43.580> does<00:03:43.910> come<00:03:44.209> through<00:03:44.600> it's

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
everybody water does come through it's

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.600 
everybody water does come through it's
not<00:03:45.110> going<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.350> come<00:03:45.470> into<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.830> soup<00:03:46.130> it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
not going to come into the soup it's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.920 
not going to come into the soup it's
then<00:03:46.790> going<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.120> funneled<00:03:47.540> out<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
then going to be funneled out of the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.009 
then going to be funneled out of the
drain<00:03:48.140> holes<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> suit<00:03:48.830> okay<00:03:49.570> if<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.720> pull

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
drain holes on the suit okay if I pull

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.420 
drain holes on the suit okay if I pull
the<00:03:51.200> little<00:03:51.350> zip<00:03:51.590> system<00:03:51.890> apart<00:03:52.190> here<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
the little zip system apart here the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.190 
the little zip system apart here the
only<00:03:55.670> area<00:03:55.910> water<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.450> really<00:03:56.660> get<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:56.959> is

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
only area water can really get in is

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.479 
only area water can really get in is
obviously<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> be<00:03:57.769> who<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.100> as<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.340> see

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
obviously going to be who you as you see

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.740 
obviously going to be who you as you see
the<00:03:58.610> neck<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.000> face<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.480> come<00:03:59.660> off

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the neck and the face of you come off

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.240 
the neck and the face of you come off
you<00:03:59.870> or<00:04:00.019> your<00:04:00.530> board<00:04:00.739> or<00:04:00.920> whatever<00:04:01.100> you're

riding<00:04:01.670> it's<00:04:02.150> going<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.780> come<00:04:02.930> in<00:04:03.050> through

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
riding it's going to come in through

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.540 
riding it's going to come in through
here<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:03.560> again<00:04:03.800> it's<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.040> drained<00:04:04.370> out

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
here but again it's just drained out

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.910 
here but again it's just drained out
through<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.850> drain<00:04:05.060> holes<00:04:05.300> lez<00:04:06.140> if<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.769> then

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
through the drain holes lez if is then

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.470 
through the drain holes lez if is then
strategically<00:04:07.130> sort<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:07.910> placed<00:04:08.150> on<00:04:08.450> a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
strategically sort of placed on a

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.979 
strategically sort of placed on a
diagonal<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:10.299> diagonal<00:04:11.299> what's<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.840> word

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
diagonal and diagonal what's the word

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.190 
diagonal and diagonal what's the word
I'm<00:04:12.110> looking<00:04:12.140> for<00:04:12.670> diagonal<00:04:13.670> angle<00:04:13.910> okay<00:04:14.690> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
I'm looking for diagonal angle okay to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.930 
I'm looking for diagonal angle okay to
filter<00:04:15.830> any<00:04:15.920> water<00:04:16.130> out<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.489> suit<00:04:16.640> that<00:04:16.760> does

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
filter any water out the suit that does

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.580 
filter any water out the suit that does
come<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:17.750> will<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.140> run<00:04:18.410> down

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
come in so it will just run down

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.050 
come in so it will just run down
basically<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.310> everything<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.820> really

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
basically so everything is really

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.150 
basically so everything is really
thought<00:04:20.330> about<00:04:20.359> with<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.690> suit<00:04:20.959> on<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.770> inside

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
thought about with a suit on the inside

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.230 
thought about with a suit on the inside
you<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.729> see

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
you can see

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.670 
you can see
the<00:04:24.240> inside<00:04:24.540> of<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.780> suit<00:04:24.990> which<00:04:25.200> this<00:04:25.380> panel

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the inside of the suit which this panel

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.560 
the inside of the suit which this panel
is<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.890> basically<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.910> brought<00:04:27.120> up<00:04:27.240> really

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
is it basically is is brought up really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.420 
is it basically is is brought up really
really<00:04:27.810> high<00:04:28.110> around<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> neck<00:04:28.830> okay<00:04:29.370> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
really high around the neck okay so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.040 
really high around the neck okay so
there's<00:04:29.730> no<00:04:29.850> chance<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.210> any<00:04:30.330> water<00:04:30.540> coming<00:04:30.930> in

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
there's no chance of any water coming in

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.170 
there's no chance of any water coming in
getting<00:04:31.170> into<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.530> suit<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.370> going<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.060> be

completely<00:04:33.540> sealed<00:04:33.870> off<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.260> stop<00:04:34.470> cold<00:04:34.800> water

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
completely sealed off to stop cold water

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.550 
completely sealed off to stop cold water

heat and all of the other things I a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.860 
heat and all of the other things I a
main<00:04:59.790> difference<00:05:00.150> is<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.300> hood<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.720> comes

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
main difference is the hood that comes

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.770 
main difference is the hood that comes

and makes it much more robust and gives
it<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.500> longer<00:06:16.770> shelf<00:06:16.950> life<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.430> also<00:06:17.730> stops

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
it a longer shelf life and also stops

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.850 
it a longer shelf life and also stops
any<00:06:18.300> water<00:06:18.660> getting<00:06:18.960> in<00:06:19.140> through<00:06:19.680> those
