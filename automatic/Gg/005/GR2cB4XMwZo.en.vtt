in<00:00:03.850> this<00:00:04.600> video<00:00:04.840> we're<00:00:05.470> going<00:00:05.590> to<00:00:05.650> take<00:00:05.800> a<00:00:05.859> look

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.570 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:06.279> primitive<00:00:06.910> objects<00:00:07.600> Maya<00:00:08.500> has<00:00:09.070> three

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
at primitive objects Maya has three

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.209 
at primitive objects Maya has three
different<00:00:10.030> types<00:00:10.540> of<00:00:10.719> primitives<00:00:11.440> that<00:00:11.709> we

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
different types of primitives that we

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.839 
different types of primitives that we
can<00:00:12.370> access<00:00:12.910> through<00:00:13.330> the<00:00:14.050> create<00:00:14.500> menu<00:00:14.849> we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
can access through the create menu we

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.920 
can access through the create menu we
have<00:00:15.880> NURBS<00:00:16.890> polygon<00:00:17.890> and<00:00:18.160> volume<00:00:19.119> let's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
have NURBS polygon and volume let's

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.920 
have NURBS polygon and volume let's
first<00:00:20.200> create<00:00:20.649> a<00:00:20.829> NURBS<00:00:21.300> primitive<00:00:22.300> object

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
first create a NURBS primitive object

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.010 
first create a NURBS primitive object
and<00:00:23.140> I'm<00:00:23.259> going<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.680> create<00:00:24.009> a<00:00:24.160> sphere<00:00:24.399> and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
and I'm going to create a sphere and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.499 
and I'm going to create a sphere and
when<00:00:26.020> I<00:00:26.050> do<00:00:26.169> so<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.739> asks<00:00:26.980> me<00:00:27.399> to<00:00:27.700> drag<00:00:28.210> on<00:00:28.450> the

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
when I do so it asks me to drag on the

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.620 
when I do so it asks me to drag on the
grid<00:00:28.989> so<00:00:29.500> if<00:00:29.739> I<00:00:29.890> left<00:00:30.309> click<00:00:30.820> anywhere<00:00:31.419> on<00:00:31.480> that

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
grid so if I left click anywhere on that

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.400 
grid so if I left click anywhere on that
grid<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.290> drag<00:00:33.130> out<00:00:33.340> my<00:00:33.579> nerves<00:00:34.540> sphere<00:00:35.260> is

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
grid and drag out my nerves sphere is

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.250 
grid and drag out my nerves sphere is
then<00:00:35.680> created<00:00:36.340> when<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:37.240> let<00:00:37.510> go<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:38.050> left

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
then created when I let go of the left

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.690 
then created when I let go of the left
mouse<00:00:38.410> button<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:39.190> creation<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:39.880> complete

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
mouse button the creation is complete

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
mouse button the creation is complete
now<00:00:42.060> primitive<00:00:42.690> objects<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.410> come<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
now primitive objects all come with a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.570 
now primitive objects all come with a
creation<00:00:45.030> node<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.650> right<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.220> in<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
creation node this is right here in the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.740 
creation node this is right here in the
inputs<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.540> our<00:00:49.080> channel<00:00:49.500> box<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:50.000> can<00:00:51.000> click<00:00:51.510> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
inputs in our channel box I can click on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.890 
inputs in our channel box I can click on
that<00:00:52.350> creation<00:00:53.010> node<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.840> modify<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
that creation node and modify the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.530 
that creation node and modify the
components<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.220> into<00:00:56.430> making<00:00:56.970> this

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
components that go into making this

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.190 
components that go into making this
particular<00:00:57.989> object<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.450> instance<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.989> we

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
particular object so for instance if we

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.710 
particular object so for instance if we
wanted<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.530> add<00:01:01.650> more<00:01:02.190> sections<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.570> our

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
wanted to add more sections to our

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.830 
wanted to add more sections to our
object<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.500> click<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.430> word<00:01:05.610> sections<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
object I can click the word sections and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.400 
object I can click the word sections and
then<00:01:07.460> middle<00:01:08.460> mouse<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.150> drag<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
then middle mouse and drag in the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.969 
then middle mouse and drag in the
viewport<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.850> increase<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.870> decrease<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
viewport to increase or decrease the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.020 
viewport to increase or decrease the
amount<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.119> sections<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.310> spans<00:01:17.310> will<00:01:17.880> give

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
amount of sections and spans will give

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.470 
amount of sections and spans will give
it<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.660> opposite<00:01:19.110> direction

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.470 

now<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.870> only<00:01:22.410> work<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.000> particular

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
now these only work for this particular

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.870 
now these only work for this particular
object<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.620> case<00:01:25.860> sections<00:01:26.760> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
object and in this case sections and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
object and in this case sections and
spans<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.660> something<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.560> specific<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
spans is something that is specific to a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.760 
spans is something that is specific to a
nerves<00:01:30.390> surface<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:32.070> nerves<00:01:32.490> stands<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
nerves surface now nerves stands for

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.300 
nerves surface now nerves stands for
non-uniform<00:01:34.770> rational<00:01:35.600> b-splines<00:01:37.310> nerves

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
non-uniform rational b-splines nerves

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.470 
non-uniform rational b-splines nerves
are<00:01:39.230> approximated<00:01:40.230> surfaces<00:01:41.330> meaning<00:01:42.330> that

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
are approximated surfaces meaning that

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.650 
are approximated surfaces meaning that
their<00:01:43.050> components<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.160> what<00:01:44.940> we<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.300> see

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
their components or what we actually see

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.390 
their components or what we actually see
is<00:01:46.730> not<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:48.270> actual<00:01:48.690> surface<00:01:49.370> for<00:01:50.370> instance

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
is not the actual surface for instance

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.840 
is not the actual surface for instance
if<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.060> hit<00:01:51.270> f8<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.050> go<00:01:52.440> into<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:53.130> component

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
if I hit f8 and go into my component

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.420 
if I hit f8 and go into my component
mode<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.300> this<00:01:54.390> particular<00:01:54.750> object<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.370> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
mode for this particular object you can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
mode for this particular object you can
see<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.150> points<00:01:57.690> themselves<00:01:58.040> do<00:01:59.040> not

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
see that the points themselves do not

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.710 
see that the points themselves do not
actually<00:01:59.670> sit<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.860> surface<00:02:02.720> they're

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
actually sit on the surface they're

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.690 
actually sit on the surface they're
actually<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.260> little<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:04.830> away<00:02:05.010> from<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
actually a little bit away from the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.090 
actually a little bit away from the
surface<00:02:05.910> if<00:02:06.600> i<00:02:06.720> were<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> grab<00:02:07.260> one<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.800> just

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
surface if i were to grab one and just

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.310 
surface if i were to grab one and just
move<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.720> pulls

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
move it out see that it actually pulls

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.250 
move it out see that it actually pulls
even<00:02:10.710> further<00:02:11.220> away<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
even further away from it this is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
even further away from it this is
because<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.980> surface<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:15.240> an

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
because this surface is just an

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.920 
because this surface is just an
approximation<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.460> what<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.390> actual

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
approximation it is not what the actual

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.260 
approximation it is not what the actual
surface<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.160> look<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.400> it's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
surface is going to look like it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.720 
surface is going to look like it's
pretty<00:02:21.540> close<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.350> render<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:22.860> out<00:02:23.070> will

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
pretty close if we render this out will

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760 
pretty close if we render this out will
actually<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.900> surface<00:02:25.290> it'll<00:02:25.530> be

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
actually take the surface it'll be

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.100 
actually take the surface it'll be
converted<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.340> triangles<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.209> we'll<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.990> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
converted to triangles and we'll see it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.199 
converted to triangles and we'll see it
in<00:02:28.290> its<00:02:28.380> true<00:02:28.650> form<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:29.940> match

a polygon object before I do so I've

and let's copy that tab so we can see

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.449 
and let's copy that tab so we can see

this

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.659 
this
and<00:05:21.819> now<00:05:22.270> it<00:05:22.479> takes<00:05:22.719> that<00:05:22.990> cube<00:05:23.379> and<00:05:23.680> smooth<00:05:24.490> is

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
and now it takes that cube and smooth is

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.029 
and now it takes that cube and smooth is
it<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:25.139> here<00:05:26.139> we<00:05:26.169> can<00:05:26.409> see<00:05:26.559> that<00:05:26.680> we're<00:05:26.830> using

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
it and here we can see that we're using

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.629 
it and here we can see that we're using
the<00:05:27.309> global<00:05:27.729> subdivision<00:05:28.659> method<00:05:29.050> if<00:05:29.639> we

the global subdivision method if we

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.049 
the global subdivision method if we
uncheck<00:05:30.819> that<00:05:31.120> we're<00:05:32.020> using<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.979> open<00:05:33.219> sub

div by Catmull clark and this gives us a

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.549 
div by Catmull clark and this gives us a
very<00:05:38.289> nice<00:05:38.680> subdivision<00:05:39.249> surface<00:05:40.289> now<00:05:41.289> we<00:05:41.349> can

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
very nice subdivision surface now we can

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.610 
very nice subdivision surface now we can
also<00:05:41.740> choose<00:05:42.099> to<00:05:42.159> display<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:44.229> different

also choose to display the different

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.110 
also choose to display the different
subdivisions<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:45.520> i'm<00:05:45.639> just<00:05:45.879> going<00:05:46.059> to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
subdivisions and i'm just going to

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.570 
subdivisions and i'm just going to
toggle<00:05:46.389> back<00:05:46.749> to<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.199> global<00:05:47.650> subdivision

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
toggle back to the global subdivision

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.830 
toggle back to the global subdivision
method<00:05:48.729> there

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.870 

and<00:05:52.930> I'm<00:05:53.650> going<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.800> turn<00:05:53.949> those<00:05:54.250> subdivisions

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
and I'm going to turn those subdivisions

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.480 
and I'm going to turn those subdivisions
off<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.690> we<00:05:56.199> can<00:05:56.350> take<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.590> look<00:05:56.830> here<00:05:56.860> where<00:05:57.250> we

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
off and we can take a look here where we

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.420 
off and we can take a look here where we
can<00:05:57.520> change<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.990> amount<00:05:59.350> of<00:05:59.530> divisions<00:06:00.310> that

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
can change the amount of divisions that

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.960 
can change the amount of divisions that
we<00:06:00.730> see<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.300> our<00:06:01.540> object<00:06:02.160> so<00:06:03.160> if<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.669> want<00:06:03.760> to<00:06:03.880> get

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
we see on our object so if I want to get

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.900 
we see on our object so if I want to get
back<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.300> that<00:06:04.330> cube<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:05.050> can<00:06:05.290> just<00:06:05.470> change<00:06:05.740> that

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
back to that cube I can just change that

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.629 
back to that cube I can just change that
20<00:06:06.960> division<00:06:07.960> levels<00:06:08.320> if<00:06:08.500> you<00:06:09.070> want<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.340> smooth

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
20 division levels if you want to smooth

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.450 
20 division levels if you want to smooth
it<00:06:09.850> even<00:06:10.240> higher<00:06:10.449> we<00:06:11.440> can<00:06:11.620> go<00:06:11.770> out<00:06:11.919> to<00:06:12.070> a<00:06:12.100> four

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
it even higher we can go out to a four

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.659 
it even higher we can go out to a four
or<00:06:12.699> even<00:06:12.729> type<00:06:13.210> in<00:06:13.389> a<00:06:13.510> value<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.370> change<00:06:15.370> that

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
or even type in a value and change that

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.370 
or even type in a value and change that
cube<00:06:16.180> into<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.810> sphere

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.020 

now<00:06:19.500> when<00:06:19.680> I<00:06:19.710> right<00:06:19.980> click<00:06:20.010> and<00:06:20.580> go<00:06:20.640> into<00:06:21.000> a

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
now when I right click and go into a

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.880 
now when I right click and go into a
component<00:06:21.690> mode<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.110> let's<00:06:22.260> increase<00:06:22.530> this<00:06:22.830> a

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
component mode and let's increase this a

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.230 
component mode and let's increase this a
little<00:06:23.160> bit

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
little bit

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.080 
little bit
you<00:06:24.810> can<00:06:24.990> see<00:06:25.169> that<00:06:25.199> it<00:06:25.440> acts<00:06:25.729> somewhat<00:06:26.729> like

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
you can see that it acts somewhat like

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.589 
you can see that it acts somewhat like
that<00:06:27.419> nerves<00:06:27.840> surface<00:06:28.710> my<00:06:29.610> manipulator<00:06:30.389> is

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
that nerves surface my manipulator is

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.379 
that nerves surface my manipulator is
actually<00:06:31.319> sitting<00:06:31.680> off<00:06:31.949> of<00:06:32.340> the<00:06:32.460> surface<00:06:32.669> this

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
actually sitting off of the surface this

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.439 
actually sitting off of the surface this
manipulator<00:06:34.020> here<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.590> right<00:06:35.580> where<00:06:35.910> this

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
manipulator here is right where this

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.740 
manipulator here is right where this
vertex<00:06:37.110> was<00:06:37.440> back<00:06:38.280> when<00:06:38.520> it<00:06:38.639> was<00:06:38.669> a<00:06:38.789> cube<00:06:39.180> and

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
vertex was back when it was a cube and

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.180 
vertex was back when it was a cube and
I'll<00:06:39.840> lower<00:06:40.050> this<00:06:40.259> down<00:06:40.319> and<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:40.830> can<00:06:40.979> see

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
I'll lower this down and you can see

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.580 
I'll lower this down and you can see
boom<00:06:41.610> there<00:06:42.030> it<00:06:42.060> is<00:06:42.360> it<00:06:42.630> lines<00:06:42.900> right<00:06:43.139> back<00:06:43.349> up

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
boom there it is it lines right back up

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.180 
boom there it is it lines right back up
but<00:06:44.130> if<00:06:44.280> I<00:06:44.400> increase<00:06:44.639> that<00:06:45.120> smoothness<00:06:45.569> level

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
but if I increase that smoothness level

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.640 
but if I increase that smoothness level
now<00:06:47.190> it<00:06:47.400> becomes<00:06:47.729> a<00:06:48.030> bit<00:06:48.240> more<00:06:48.650> approximated

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
now it becomes a bit more approximated

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.749 
now it becomes a bit more approximated
so<00:06:50.430> this<00:06:50.819> type<00:06:51.090> of<00:06:51.120> smoothing<00:06:51.990> or<00:06:52.759> subdivision

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
so this type of smoothing or subdivision

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.490 
so this type of smoothing or subdivision
surface<00:06:54.240> is<00:06:54.449> a<00:06:55.340> hybrid<00:06:56.340> of<00:06:56.659> nerves<00:06:57.659> features

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
surface is a hybrid of nerves features

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.969 
surface is a hybrid of nerves features
as<00:06:58.770> well<00:06:58.800> as<00:06:59.340> polygons<00:07:00.180> features<00:07:00.710> the<00:07:01.710> great

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
as well as polygons features the great

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.490 
as well as polygons features the great
part<00:07:02.280> about<00:07:02.340> this<00:07:02.669> is<00:07:02.880> that<00:07:03.210> at<00:07:03.750> any<00:07:03.960> point<00:07:04.319> in

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
part about this is that at any point in

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.040 
part about this is that at any point in
time<00:07:04.909> we'll<00:07:05.909> just<00:07:06.090> return<00:07:06.240> this<00:07:06.569> back<00:07:06.810> to<00:07:07.020> a

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
time we'll just return this back to a

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.559 
time we'll just return this back to a
level<00:07:07.289> two<00:07:07.560> and<00:07:07.740> just<00:07:08.099> close<00:07:08.400> that<00:07:08.430> is<00:07:08.849> that<00:07:09.449> I

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569 
level two and just close that is that I

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.219 
level two and just close that is that I
can<00:07:09.870> toggle<00:07:10.169> between<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:11.550> polygon<00:07:12.539> surface<00:07:12.810> and

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
can toggle between a polygon surface and

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.909 
can toggle between a polygon surface and
a<00:07:13.560> sub<00:07:13.770> D<00:07:13.979> surface<00:07:14.460> by<00:07:14.849> hitting<00:07:15.270> one<00:07:15.840> or<00:07:16.139> three

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
a sub D surface by hitting one or three

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.470 
a sub D surface by hitting one or three
on<00:07:17.280> the<00:07:17.699> keyboard

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.360 

so<00:07:20.630> I<00:07:20.660> can<00:07:20.870> work<00:07:21.050> with<00:07:21.290> it<00:07:21.320> at<00:07:21.530> any<00:07:22.070> one<00:07:22.340> of

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
so I can work with it at any one of

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.410 
so I can work with it at any one of
those<00:07:22.610> levels

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
those levels

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.450 
those levels
my<00:07:25.050> last<00:07:25.320> primitive<00:07:26.010> let's<00:07:26.370> delete<00:07:26.730> this

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
my last primitive let's delete this

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.050 
my last primitive let's delete this
go<00:07:28.580> to<00:07:28.639> create<00:07:29.180> is<00:07:29.560> the<00:07:30.560> volume<00:07:31.100> primitive<00:07:31.850> and

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060 
go to create is the volume primitive and

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.510 
go to create is the volume primitive and
with<00:07:32.930> a<00:07:32.960> volume<00:07:33.350> primitive<00:07:34.039> let's<00:07:34.310> just

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
with a volume primitive let's just

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.220 
with a volume primitive let's just
create<00:07:34.729> one

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
create one

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.230 
create one
what<00:07:36.680> we<00:07:36.770> get<00:07:37.010> is<00:07:37.190> called<00:07:37.460> an<00:07:37.610> implicit

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
what we get is called an implicit

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.290 
what we get is called an implicit
surface<00:07:39.140> what<00:07:40.130> this<00:07:40.280> means<00:07:40.520> is<00:07:40.640> that<00:07:40.700> I<00:07:40.850> cannot

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
surface what this means is that I cannot

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.530 
surface what this means is that I cannot
change<00:07:41.810> any<00:07:42.260> of<00:07:42.560> the<00:07:42.890> components<00:07:43.310> that<00:07:44.150> make

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.540 
change any of the components that make

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.950 
change any of the components that make
this<00:07:44.840> surface<00:07:45.500> up<00:07:45.680> I<00:07:46.040> could<00:07:46.730> scale<00:07:47.060> and<00:07:47.450> rotate

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 
this surface up I could scale and rotate

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.710 
this surface up I could scale and rotate
and<00:07:48.200> move<00:07:48.230> it<00:07:48.530> around<00:07:48.880> but<00:07:49.880> I<00:07:50.030> can<00:07:50.330> never<00:07:50.450> go

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
and move it around but I can never go

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.220 
and move it around but I can never go
down<00:07:50.930> to<00:07:51.260> a<00:07:51.290> vertex<00:07:52.100> level<00:07:53.060> and<00:07:53.240> manipulate

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.230 
down to a vertex level and manipulate

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.160 
down to a vertex level and manipulate
those<00:07:54.860> components<00:07:55.340> individually<00:07:55.790> to<00:07:56.690> change

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.170 
those components individually to change

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.980 
those components individually to change
the<00:07:57.470> shape<00:07:57.710> of<00:07:57.950> this<00:07:58.100> surface<00:07:58.750> now<00:07:59.750> we<00:07:59.810> don't

00:07:59.980 --> 00:07:59.990 
the shape of this surface now we don't

really use volume primitives from

really use volume primitives from
modeling<00:08:02.360> but<00:08:03.110> we<00:08:03.230> can<00:08:03.500> use<00:08:03.890> them<00:08:04.190> to<00:08:04.550> create

modeling but we can use them to create

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.080 
modeling but we can use them to create
fog<00:08:05.450> effects<00:08:05.930> or<00:08:06.230> even<00:08:06.590> specific<00:08:07.160> light<00:08:07.580> type
