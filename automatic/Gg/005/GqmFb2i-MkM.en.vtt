00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.820
 although we must make minion cookies 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.070
 and let's start with the regular cookie 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.050
 and we're going to cover it with royal lighting 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.670
 yellow first on the entire surface and 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.040
 we are going to do it slowly because it does not 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.470
 It can be very redondito and after 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.380
 they are going to fill the whole cookie does not have 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.739
 to be uniform from the beginning 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.840
 with a shower first the whole 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.760
 cookie with yellow and then with 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 a tool that they can use with pick 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.769
 then all the lighting is accommodated 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.300
 important to emphasize that it is not 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.519
 stress because they are super 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.590
 redondito from the beginning because 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.660
 then you can move with it with this 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.879
 tool with a toothpick with one that 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.250
 goes with whatever you have on hand you can 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.379
 go back to do the whole little shore and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.390
 it is super cute then clear to try 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.890
 to make it as round as possible 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.829
 principle so that they do not work as much 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 but the same and moves and accommodates and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 it is super good 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 and nothing else with the nail I'm 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 removing a bit that was too much 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 come out and ready now with the royal ay without 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.450
 white let's do the little eye this is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.620
 technique wet on wet so no 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.080
 they have to wait for the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.580
 yellow we put yellow and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 immediately after the white and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 then it's going to be a uniform layer 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 of paint after immediately 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.170
 then the coffee and it's also going to join 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.270
 in a single layer and then 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 immediately after we are going to put 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.100
 the inner part of the eye that is black 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.810
 and everything is going to stay the same, everything is going 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.990
 to be a layer nothing is going to stand out here 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.320
 and here we start making the leagues of the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 viewer that go sideways everything is 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.580
 cool then everything will stay 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.490
 parejito nothing else take care of that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.920
 go up and without strap well here we go to 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.140
 boquita do I like this 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.820
 case make this design the mouth very 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.229
 simple because it 's the one of an eye looks like 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 frightened but can make her laugh 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.060
 open closed just a little dot and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 then depending how they fit there 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.269
 they also do with their tool with their 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.720
 stick as well as lighting 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.760
 after 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.760
 and we're going to do the inner part of the eye 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.670
 the light that is me nothing else I take a 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.980
 little bit of there without white of the duia and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.080
 I put it like that if we put him in doubt 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.460
 full is going to be too white and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 we just want to give you a little light ok 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.070
 here what we are going to do next is the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.380
 hair can do it like that still wet about 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.870
 wet hair also go away 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.790
 putting in the same layer of bitumen or 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.520
 you can expect the yellow to be dry 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.530
 and they do the hair later and it stays 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.720
 highlighted but I what I want 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 is highlighted nothing else is the viewer like this 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.030
 that's why I do it all in one 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.880
 layer after to like the hairs well for 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.010
 that everything is small and I like that 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.990
 stay now as you see on TV not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.770
 be the bottom part thickest and the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.100
 top part more delgadito 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.190
 ok here that already dry we have to leave 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.410
 two or three hours dry and then with 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.800
 the and without gray that has more consistency 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.000
 hard we started making the metal part 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.970
 of the viewer then nothing else is a matter 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 to make the round about 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.210
 eye worth the little redundancy that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.920
 they are well redondito always 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.160
 can accommodate you can always move 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.480
 you can always correct it so you do not know 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.190
 worry if they do not have super 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.470
 redondito can be moved a little bit 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.380
 clear the issue it is to work it 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.390
 less possible then there is nothing more then 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 it fits and such and it is ready 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.810
 viewfinder and then with silver paint and 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.750
 vodka let's do the metallic part 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.730
 once it is already dry the super gray 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.030
 pity that I moved the camera did not 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.250
 I noticed he was there 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.890
 out of focus but the only thing that I am 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.920
 doing is 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.200
 to paint the gray part silver 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.690
 you can also leave the royal ay without 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.579
 white to make the viewer but for 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.890
 example if they have any problem that 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.320
 cover well so that to cover well the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.110
 viewfinder and such with the silver is better than 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.630
 be in gray and so already battle in less 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.570
 in pairs plus the color and these the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.490
 they can leave drying all night 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.490
 there is already a good list super cute
