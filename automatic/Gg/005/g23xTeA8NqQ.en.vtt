a<00:01:44.430> HD<00:01:45.210> pressure<00:01:45.509> suit<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.009> suit<00:01:47.280> has

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
a HD pressure suit and in this suit has

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
a HD pressure suit and in this suit has
400<00:01:48.240> chambers<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.290> chamber<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
400 chambers and the chamber is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
400 chambers and the chamber is
basically<00:01:50.280> inflate<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> deflate<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.869> high

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
basically inflate and deflate with high

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
basically inflate and deflate with high
and<00:01:52.200> low<00:01:52.320> pressure<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.360> promotes<00:01:54.360> blood

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and low pressure it promotes blood

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
and low pressure it promotes blood
circulation<00:01:55.079> from<00:01:55.500> her<00:01:55.710> stomach<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> her

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
circulation from her stomach and her

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.830 
circulation from her stomach and her
inner<00:01:56.729> thigh<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.030> outer<00:01:57.299> thigh<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> the

provided<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.659> oxygen<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> nutrients<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
provided with oxygen and nutrients and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
provided with oxygen and nutrients and
makes<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> skin<00:02:03.149> firmer<00:02:03.630> okay<00:02:04.259> we're<00:02:04.590> going
