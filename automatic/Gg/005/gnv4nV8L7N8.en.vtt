orange flavored hostess cupcakes are
better<00:03:17.010> than<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.159> chocolate<00:03:18.430> version<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:22.349> I'm

better than the chocolate version I I'm

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.559 
better than the chocolate version I I'm
being<00:03:23.709> bold<00:03:24.069> by<00:03:24.370> saying<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.420> think

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
being bold by saying that but I think

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.899 
being bold by saying that but I think
that's<00:03:26.049> true<00:03:26.409> I'm<00:03:26.680> pretty<00:03:27.069> sure<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.670> it

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
that's true I'm pretty sure that it

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.569 
that's true I'm pretty sure that it
reaches<00:03:28.359> that<00:03:28.389> point<00:03:29.010> maybe<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.189> might<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.549> a

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
reaches that point maybe I might do a

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.240 
reaches that point maybe I might do a
comparison<00:03:31.060> video<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:32.439> I<00:03:32.739> don't<00:03:33.129> know<00:03:33.220> like
