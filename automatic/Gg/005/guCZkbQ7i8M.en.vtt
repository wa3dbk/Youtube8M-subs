00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
through a lot of wars so there must be a

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.920 
through a lot of wars so there must be a
reason<00:03:14.730> why<00:03:15.620> we're<00:03:16.620> still<00:03:16.890> alive<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.930> there

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
was no reason why do we get into a lot

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.630 
was no reason why do we get into a lot
of<00:03:21.360> wars<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.829> it's<00:03:23.250> hard<00:03:23.400> to
