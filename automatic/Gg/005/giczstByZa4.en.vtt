00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 the tank and today I'm bringing the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 channel plus a video and this time I'll 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 discussing some information 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.020
 about next-generation minecraft and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 was a suggestion to one of the subscribers 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 due to it was going to the xbox one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 ps 4 and also ps vita has lots of stuff 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 cool I think there's a lot of people 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 anxious who mainly have in the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 if you do not have an xbox or even more 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.170
 I intend to have it so I'm already anxious. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.430
 Because the game promises a lot in this one. 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 good format 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 first let's start by talking about the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.190
 map had rumors that the map was 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.590
 infinite equal to the computer however 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.469
 soon was denied by the studio ford 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.649
 who said he will not be infinite 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.660
 but it will be much bigger than the xbox 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.410
 360 being twice as large 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.160
 This is good It is not infinite It is not 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 good on the Portuguese side and not doing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.579
 many more things but I do not think so 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.770
 It will be a problem because they said 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 who are investing and many others 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 cool things continuing the game 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 will apparently be released on the second 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 or third quarter of this year on the website 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 hygiene if you occupy a site 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.939
 hygiene at the time was written there 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.560
 which would now be released in May but 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.570
 did not have one had any information 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 Ford Studio official and I believe 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.409
 that it will not even be released and is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 A lot of dollars just said that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.750
 were working on the right version 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.540
 a reason a rumor there that will be a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.189
 trailer announcing the new 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.100
 features of the game in a few 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 Well, I think I'm going out on the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.049
 e3 how it came out in the past was announced 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.939
 only in the past it was only announced for 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.450
 xbox and why it was still 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.189
 exclusive of 360's microsoft 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 But now he does not have it anymore. 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
 exclusivity, many people already know 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.180
 that he left by ps3 and equality 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.670
 version of xbox 360 a positive thing 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.649
 which will also see the dedicated server is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.100
 what they were already talking about at the beginning of 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.020
 xbox 360 that would have servers you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 buy a server and I'll leave it online 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.110
 equal and on bf3 on bs-4 and against server 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.560
 paid so much and you leave online for 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 play 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.540
 It's cool, this for the motorcycle I played. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 I think I would need a lot more 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.590
 to stay the same as the pc that has to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.270
 Can you do a lot more things one? 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.550
 game more fun but it's something 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.200
 because he saw friends there he can 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.400
 leave it open to you in a video game 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.630
 must be connected 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 The problem is that you will never stay 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.310
 in your video game will host in a space 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 will decide whether at least one 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.690
 xbox a good 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.700
 he the pec 4 will come with a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.680
 functionality that integration is 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.630
 Important when you can use 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
 he to fiddle in the creative mode to choose 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.490
 the items is one thing but believe in one 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.340
 xbox one will have a lot of new stuff 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.140
 High on you cnet 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.520
 Good if you'll catch up for example. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.470
 the sand d block 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.020
 there kinect will leyva seems a stroke of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 arena called good is worth imagining right? 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.330
 I'm talking now about the 16 content that is 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.430
 the future single console upgrade 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.190
 information currently available on TV 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.200
 because it's just your 15 and he's going 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.910
 be bringing horses the interest 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 clothes the only information you have on 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.820
 official online kraft forum that based 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.500
 on twitter from the studio fan 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.300
 Something else too that I think goes 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.850
 to bid for the molds that I think 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.410
 that since the minecraft also of the xbox 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.000
 and everyone left wondering if he was going to 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.780
 no one has ever touched this 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.330
 subject matter 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.220
 they released the ipec text there 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.890
 filling people with texture 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.390
 only one person only texture peccato vai 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.160
 Throw a new thing that tripod you 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.020
 already filled the bag I see you think 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.459
 there is a lot of texture and pec and 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.500
 set aside the molds 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.980
 I believe they will bring this new 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.240
 online version of the xbox mother of the ps4 sure 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.860
 Why do you have to bring 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.550
 however there is no information yet 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.800
 but I assume that it is very likely that 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.709
 death packages paid for by 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.190
 skyrim example the packet mode with 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.220
 new items total new things 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.690
 such real price 10 is quite capable of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.850
 only exists because it is a way to win 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.580
 money on the islands that much 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.820
 because on the pc it's free and you can 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.990
 do it for free then the consoles do not have 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.299
 this life 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.540
 microsoft's and sony's policies 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.370
 but it's something interesting, too sure. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.490
 This one I just wanted to inform you in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.590
 a debate here with you on the new 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.870
 those that go to me this version any 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.150
 track any video that comes out there I go 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.039
 I'm bringing the right channel here, I hope. 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.050
 Who would have liked if you liked your 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.370
 favorite book and if not enrolled in 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.410
