00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 they said the menu was for children 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.670
 that is to say, children are kids in this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 video I talk about bigfix that came out 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.869
 in cinemas a few months 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 does it because I tell you about it because unfortunately 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.960
 I will tell you come out in coincidence with the con 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.880
 the hobbit and film editing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 at least in my region they chose to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.890
 dedicate their spaces more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.329
 to the hobbit cinepanettoni rather than a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 this film deserves my opinion 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.570
 lot 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.489
 therefore I thought of making it known 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.040
 through this video expressing yourself in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.750
 any opinion on the film is not a true e 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 own review because I will not tell you 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 who was the director or 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 unemployed dubbing or things 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 of the kind more than anything else I will tell you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.520
 just things I thought of when 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 I've seen everything here will have been too 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.899
 at etna comics day shooting which is one 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.840
 preview of the event that takes place in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.549
 Sicily at the end of May, beginning of June after 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.409
 obtained after so many hours in a row 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.479
 two beautiful drawings of this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.250
 made by rock di salvo and these 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.409
 instead made by dario theroux tv 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.680
 which has faithfully reproduced the mind of 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.320
 original themes for those interested 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.479
 wind that we will meet at e3 onyx 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.619
 because I work allowing I hope to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.229
 be present too 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.050
 the film compared to the comic brought 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.520
 differences 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.920
 I had no way to read the comic 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.380
 so personally I don't know about it though 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.110
 I had to deal with it anyway I was 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.210
 He said by those who elected him months 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.250
 that bei max in particular compared to 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.160
 the cuddly one we see in the film 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.080
 in comics reality is very different though 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.480
 as I said before not having a good one 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.940
 Comic book knowledge will take a moment 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.700
 aside this aspect that maybe 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.200
 someone else will explain better 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.570
 this video I only say mild 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.370
 what I saw genoa was that it was 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.890
 obviously re-used with a band 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.900
 of inferior age that to me however christ 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.880
 dead 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.940
 personally I honestly say it with 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.010
 I wholeheartedly appreciated p 0 very much 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.410
 more than other films that have come out 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.960
 presently as a freud or as a brain 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.030
 because compared to these other two films 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.760
 animation that I think have been 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 absolutely developed for one 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 more merchandising issue for one 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.110
 sale dedicated to children of more or age 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.080
 less than two to nine years about the myths 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 instead I ruin a stronger plot one 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.700
 major study of all the characters 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.709
 not just those protagonists a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.800
 group work that is not alone 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.010
 finalized to the da vendica that has precisely 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.050
 a much more much more construction 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.850
 worked at least that's the idea that me 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.560
 turned up this movie 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.870
 I will also talk about others in other videos 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.730
 two films so given then krauser I entered 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.190
 blue of what I liked and what I didn't 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.959
 I liked the cun and I believe there 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.270
 are in the plot or in other aspects of the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.080
 movie things I don't want to touch on 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.390
 this time to focus on the film 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.490
 if we're going to deal when 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.980
 always from the cinema I admit that I too 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.460
 reap judgments on this film because I 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.260
 I have a dispassionate love it 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.690
 Ragonese and the fact that one of the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
 protagonists albeit secondary to the film 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 were the marked copy of the tip is 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.210
 simply with glasses he turned 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.910
 very much bother but I have to say that 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.920
 strangely, I did not expect it then 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.320
 honor to those who have made with su film ea 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.180
 who is characterized characters as 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 that I really wanted the movie not 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.580
 flowers connected to his figures and if any 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.750
 want to never reconnect veil 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.400
 also to say that a little all the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.800
 female characters are reported there 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.390
 same model for example coco that the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.550
 my character because the film is the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 girl with the yellow uniform was precisely 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.740
 some kotti heads and the character 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.410
 instead equal to the point that is what 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.870
 when they turn dressed in pink and 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.310
 obviously the marked copy of the head 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.200
 the main character's aunt is one 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.730
 more or less a copy of the mother who 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.890
 in other words, the whole family aims 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.870
 should this film be back now I do 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.840
 I ask strain sentence they found the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.860
 sorry for the pact that anyway rapunzel e 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.050
 the two sisters are therefore not cousins 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.180
 high and delta are cousins ​​of the dust 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 this time it will be a parallel universe 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.380
 I appreciated a lot anyway 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.570
 well structured plot from the beginning to 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.789
 finally opening an engaging storyline 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.620
 finally a plot that takes in 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.699
 consideration all aspects of 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.949
 history then the main hero the 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.139
 group of friends surrounding the hero 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.300
 enemy that is thought to be one but with 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.800
 maybe it turns out to be another consideration 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.539
 the film that tries to understand through 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.520
 who could it be? 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.630
 and there are those who arrived before there are those who are 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.210
 arrived later 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.030
 and references beautiful references 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.590
 to the marvel universe as for example now 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.020
 I didn't want the rare ones but towards the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.949
 end of the film there is a fortissimo 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.300
 reference to events 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.810
 there was a particular scene that 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.199
 concerns in a men as it is seen 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.639
 already our armor of goods max 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.860
 beautiful characters as a teletutto in 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.990
 characterized and that have their own role 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.940
 that make themselves felt despite not 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.220
 invade the main role of 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.410
 beautiful bay but protagonist 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.150
 obviously that according to us but for how much 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.039
 has been adapted and I repeat not 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.650
 I know the main version that I have 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.470
 nothing to stay much more tough and second 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.210
 me was really studied well is a 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.220
 like character does not fall into 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.990
 ridiculous neither in the study like others 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.360
 characters 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.919
 the other films 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.979
 and who knows how to attract the little ones anyway 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.260
 just as I liked them 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.050
 lots of other secondary stories too 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.310
 because there is not only the good with the 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 his friends and the villain 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.150
 within these stories there are 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.520
 also other secondary characters that 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.860
 appear even for a short time or that 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.470
 they have however, albeit indirectly, a 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.600
 their role and I really like it 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.040
 story development and I believe that 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.950
 this film really was 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.650
 really studied is conceived as 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.740
 mr disney would have wanted that too 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.710
 lately I repeat this is my idea 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.780
 he said it's right but unfortunately me 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.190
 I'm having it seems to me that the movies don't 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.780
 are more studied as once and with 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.400
 the intention of a time with love 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.229
 which once in history ends in itself 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.240
 itself but are more inclined to 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.699
 entertain an age group 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.900
 lower only to lose a 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.880
 ask the mother to buy everything 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.220
 what you owe of this character e 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.750
 all of them that the whole shooting story 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.610
 according to me a movie that finally 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.639
 comes out of this scheme is that finally 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.560
 meal lines from scratch with love and if you have 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.139
 visa shooting six 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.360
 let me know and let me know 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.949
 you have thought if you have not seen I hope 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.620
 to also have a mini curiosity about it 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:10.139
 anyway I hope you see I don't know 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.810
 when it comes in blu ray and dvd or in 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.509
 some other way 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.039
 you see us at the next video 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.870
 let me know even if this kind of 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.289
 video you liked so as to make others 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:26.370
 or directly it was not taken to do 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:28.169
 the more we have made gen inerts 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:33.539
 also an extreme sweet clothes and has it 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:36.590
 dedicated first because clicked and me 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:38.960
 I recommend watching the movie and if you want 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.469
 keep watching our videos and 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.469
 to the next
