well<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.230> thoroughly<00:00:01.860> warmed<00:00:02.100> up<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.580> engine

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
well I thoroughly warmed up the engine

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.140 
well I thoroughly warmed up the engine
and<00:00:03.170> turns<00:00:04.170> out<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:05.250> temperature<00:00:05.910> gauge

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and turns out the temperature gauge

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.259 
and turns out the temperature gauge
still<00:00:06.600> stays<00:00:06.899> below<00:00:07.290> 100<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.700> did<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.179> they

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
still stays below 100 so it did was they

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.120 
still stays below 100 so it did was they
got<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> potentiometer<00:00:10.080> here<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:11.010> know<00:00:11.099> just

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
got a potentiometer here you know just

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.910 
got a potentiometer here you know just
like<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.420> adjust<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.990> resistance<00:00:13.170> right

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
like you can adjust the resistance right

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.870 
like you can adjust the resistance right
on<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> sending<00:00:17.400> unit<00:00:18.320> shows<00:00:19.320> 600<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
on the sending unit shows 600 like a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320 
on the sending unit shows 600 like a
stock<00:00:21.300> Chevy<00:00:22.109> small-block<00:00:23.029> sending<00:00:24.029> unit

stock Chevy small-block sending unit

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.169 
stock Chevy small-block sending unit
with<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> gauge<00:00:25.220> it's<00:00:26.539> 600<00:00:27.539> ohms<00:00:27.750> resistance

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
with a gauge it's 600 ohms resistance

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.860 
with a gauge it's 600 ohms resistance
for<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> hundred<00:00:30.539> degrees<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.920> gauge<00:00:32.870> 85

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
for a hundred degrees on the gauge 85

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.959 
for a hundred degrees on the gauge 85
ohms<00:00:34.140> resistance<00:00:35.090> for<00:00:36.090> 220<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
ohms resistance for 220 so I'm going to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.660 
ohms resistance for 220 so I'm going to
show<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:41.420> 222<00:00:42.420> ohms<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.930> 220<00:00:43.770> ohms<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
show this at 222 ohms or 220 ohms that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
show this at 222 ohms or 220 ohms that
you<00:00:44.879> put<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> gauge<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:46.200> over<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> hundred<00:00:47.690> so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you put the gauge like over a hundred so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
you put the gauge like over a hundred so
I<00:00:49.969> also<00:00:50.969> want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> show<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:53.000> where<00:00:54.000> it's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I also want to show you where it's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.130 
I also want to show you where it's
located<00:00:59.000> now<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> block

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
located now it's on the side of a block

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.160 
located now it's on the side of a block
there<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:04.369> pseudo<00:01:05.369> wire<00:01:06.170> right

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
there you can see pseudo wire right

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.420 
there you can see pseudo wire right
there<00:01:07.490> actually<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.060> took<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> dremel<00:01:10.140> tool

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
there actually I took a dremel tool

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.230 
there actually I took a dremel tool
cleaned<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> wire<00:01:12.110> cleaned<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> end

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
cleaned up the wire cleaned up the end

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.980 
cleaned up the wire cleaned up the end
of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.619> sending<00:01:16.619> unit<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> little

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of the sending unit with the little

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.010 
of the sending unit with the little
stainless<00:01:19.619> steel<00:01:19.950> wire<00:01:20.299> brush<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> dremel

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
stainless steel wire brush on a dremel

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
stainless steel wire brush on a dremel
tool<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.400> making<00:01:23.729> good

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
tool just to see if was making good

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
tool just to see if was making good
contact<00:01:24.360> maybe<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> problem<00:01:25.229> because

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
contact maybe that was a problem because

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
contact maybe that was a problem because
it's<00:01:25.890> showing<00:01:26.070> infinite<00:01:26.549> resistance<00:01:26.960> yeah

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's showing infinite resistance yeah

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's showing infinite resistance yeah
well<00:01:28.409> we'll<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.860> what's<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.250> happen

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
well we'll see what's going to happen

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.149 
well we'll see what's going to happen
here<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.439> we'll<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.860> we'll

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
here because you know we'll see we'll

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.380 
here because you know we'll see we'll
see<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:34.490> think<00:01:35.490> test<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.939> yet<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
see I don't know I think test it yet so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
see I don't know I think test it yet so
we'll<00:01:36.659> find<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:40.409> by<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.890> when

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
we'll find out so and by the way when

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.410 
we'll find out so and by the way when
you<00:01:41.759> change<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> gauge<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:44.210> 20<00:01:45.210> foot

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you change that gauge it's 20 foot

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.649 
you change that gauge it's 20 foot
pounds<00:01:46.549> put<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.700> teflon<00:01:47.909> tape

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pounds put some teflon tape

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.020 
pounds put some teflon tape
so<00:01:48.840> there's<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.369> here's<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.460> connector

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so there's your here's your connector

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.620 
so there's your here's your connector
and<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> slides<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and it just you know it slides out a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810 
and it just you know it slides out a
little<00:01:54.930> end<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> gauge<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.549> plugged

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
little end of the gauge and it's plugged

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
little end of the gauge and it's plugged
into<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> block<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.229> we'll<00:01:58.619> connect<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
into the block so we'll connect the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.190 
into the block so we'll connect the
battery<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.829> see<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> do

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
battery up and see what I'm going to do

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.430 
battery up and see what I'm going to do
okay<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.530> connected<00:02:06.299> from<00:02:07.299> one<00:02:07.360> side<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
okay so I connected from one side of the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.080 
okay so I connected from one side of the
ground<00:02:09.450> through<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.630> resistance<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.790> that'll

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
ground through the resistance so that'll

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.080 
ground through the resistance so that'll
work<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.660> sending<00:02:14.020> unit<00:02:14.080> right

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
work like the sending unit right

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.440 
work like the sending unit right
potentiometer<00:02:16.090> put<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.900> 220<00:02:17.709> ohms<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
potentiometer put it like 220 ohms to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.500 
potentiometer put it like 220 ohms to
the<00:02:19.569> other<00:02:19.720> wire<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> sending<00:02:20.980> unit<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the other wire on the sending unit and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.460 
the other wire on the sending unit and
we're<00:02:22.780> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.080> what's<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
we're going to see what's going to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're going to see what's going to
happen<00:02:23.560> here<00:02:25.440> well<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.890> another<00:02:27.100> problem

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
happen here well I got another problem

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.570 
happen here well I got another problem
here<00:02:27.700> because<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.650> maybe<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.220> sending

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
here because you know maybe the sending

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.740 
here because you know maybe the sending
unit<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:30.970> bad<00:02:31.239> too<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.550> no<00:02:33.550> matter<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.360> I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
unit is bad too but no matter what if I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.590 
unit is bad too but no matter what if I
set<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.340> infinite<00:02:36.340> resistance<00:02:37.830> or

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
set it on infinite resistance or

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.870 
set it on infinite resistance or
infinite<00:02:40.600> resistance

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
infinite resistance

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.430 
infinite resistance
it<00:02:42.880> should<00:02:43.150> read<00:02:43.450> zero<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.130> gauge<00:02:46.440> 600

at<00:02:51.190> 85<00:02:52.060> homes<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:54.000> matter<00:02:55.000> what<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.239> put<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.600> on

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
at 85 homes and matter what I put it on

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.590 
at 85 homes and matter what I put it on
even<00:02:55.989> if<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.200> put<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.500> where<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.799> open<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.340> just

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
even if I put it where it's open it just

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.090 
even if I put it where it's open it just
gauge<00:02:58.600> doesn't<00:02:58.810> read<00:02:59.140> nothing<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.799> there's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
gauge doesn't read nothing so there's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
gauge doesn't read nothing so there's
something<00:03:00.370> freakin<00:03:00.850> wrong<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.690> don't

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
something freakin wrong with it I don't

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.039 
something freakin wrong with it I don't
know<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.069> wire<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.670> some<00:03:04.390> someplace

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
know the wire or some someplace

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.160 
know the wire or some someplace
I<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:06.160> know<00:03:06.220> where<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.900> mm-hmm

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
I don't know where but mm-hmm

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
I don't know where but mm-hmm
I<00:03:08.290> mean<00:03:09.160> one<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.340> those<00:03:09.489> things<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.640> will

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
I mean one of those things but I will

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.000 
I mean one of those things but I will
figure<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.720> out<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.799> want<00:03:14.920> to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
figure it out because I don't want to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.650 
figure it out because I don't want to
put<00:03:15.160> an<00:03:15.280> aftermarket<00:03:15.730> gauge<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.450> when<00:03:16.630> you

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
put an aftermarket gauge in it when you

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.930 
put an aftermarket gauge in it when you
got<00:03:16.900> nice<00:03:17.380> good<00:03:17.890> gauges<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.400> can<00:03:18.549> use<00:03:18.730> like

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
got nice good gauges you can use like

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.140 
got nice good gauges you can use like
this<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:20.079> anyway<00:03:21.040> that's<00:03:21.280> how<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.579> check<00:03:21.940> it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
this so anyway that's how you check it

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.979 
this so anyway that's how you check it
though<00:03:22.359> um<00:03:26.730> anyway<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.000> that's<00:03:28.690> how<00:03:28.870> you're

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
though um anyway so that's how you're

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.840 
though um anyway so that's how you're
checking<00:03:29.370> 85<00:03:30.370> ohms<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.870> twenty<00:03:32.850> six

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
checking 85 ohms is to twenty six

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.560 
checking 85 ohms is to twenty six
hundred<00:03:33.970> ohms

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
hundred ohms

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.280 
hundred ohms
is<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> hundred<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.209> if<00:03:37.780> I'm<00:03:37.930> putting<00:03:38.200> on

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
is a hundred so if I'm putting on

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.380 
is a hundred so if I'm putting on
resistance<00:03:38.920> when<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:39.519> being<00:03:39.700> grounded<00:03:40.209> out

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
resistance when it's being grounded out

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.569 
resistance when it's being grounded out
for<00:03:40.810> um<00:03:42.720> about<00:03:43.720> two<00:03:43.900> hundred<00:03:44.019> ohms<00:03:44.459> should<00:03:45.459> be

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
for um about two hundred ohms should be

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.710 
for um about two hundred ohms should be
you<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:46.569> like<00:03:46.810> halfway<00:03:47.650> between<00:03:48.390> 100<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.480> to

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
you know like halfway between 100 and to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.710 
you know like halfway between 100 and to
220<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.220> if<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.459> make<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.670> down<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.329> 30

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
220 and if I make it down to like 30

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.080 
220 and if I make it down to like 30
ohms<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.290> should<00:03:53.440> be<00:03:53.530> like<00:03:53.920> almost<00:03:54.850> all<00:03:55.030> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
ohms it should be like almost all the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.300 
ohms it should be like almost all the
way<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.450> other<00:03:55.569> way<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.680> tried<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.130> were

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
way the other way and I tried it were

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.210 
way the other way and I tried it were
just<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.600> know<00:03:58.660> infinite<00:03:59.290> resistance<00:03:59.590> just

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
just you know infinite resistance just

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.509 
just you know infinite resistance just
to<00:04:00.340> see<00:04:00.519> if<00:04:00.639> I<00:04:00.700> had<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.850> something<00:04:01.720> wrong<00:04:02.100> now<00:04:03.100> no

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
to see if I had a something wrong now no

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.710 
to see if I had a something wrong now no
good<00:04:03.760> no<00:04:04.569> good<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.489> I<00:04:06.700> only<00:04:06.819> got<00:04:07.030> one<00:04:07.090> gauge<00:04:07.480> out

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
good no good so I only got one gauge out

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.720 
good no good so I only got one gauge out
of<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:07.930> deal<00:04:08.170> right<00:04:08.200> add<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.370> cage

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
of this deal right add it one cage

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.550 
of this deal right add it one cage
actually<00:04:10.600> my<00:04:10.690> other<00:04:10.810> one<00:04:10.989> was<00:04:11.109> probably<00:04:11.290> good

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
actually my other one was probably good

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.289 
actually my other one was probably good
this<00:04:11.739> might<00:04:12.010> be<00:04:12.190> good<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.610> don't<00:04:12.700> know<00:04:13.000> we're

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
this might be good I don't know we're

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.280 
this might be good I don't know we're
going<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.510> find<00:04:13.780> out<00:04:14.099> but

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
going to find out but

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.840 
going to find out but
this<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.280> takes<00:04:17.550> a<00:04:17.640> while

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
this kind of takes a while

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.670 
this kind of takes a while
sometimes<00:04:18.290> sometimes<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.410> easy<00:04:19.560> sometimes

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
sometimes sometimes it's easy sometimes

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.960 
sometimes sometimes it's easy sometimes
it's<00:04:20.160> not<00:04:20.870> what<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.990> is<00:04:22.140> is<00:04:22.410> when<00:04:22.590> an<00:04:23.460> old<00:04:23.670> car

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
it's not what it is is when an old car

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.860 
it's not what it is is when an old car
sitting<00:04:24.450> around<00:04:24.660> for<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.020> while<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:27.060> know<00:04:27.540> the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
sitting around for a while I know the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.770 
sitting around for a while I know the
wires<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.700> wire<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.180> not<00:04:30.420> I

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
wires not it the wire is not I

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.030 
wires not it the wire is not I
cleaned<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.620> off<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.040> drummel<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.800> going<00:04:34.950> to

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
cleaned it off the drummel I'm going to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.410 
cleaned it off the drummel I'm going to
have<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.220> trace<00:04:35.520> everything<00:04:36.030> that's<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.330> I'm

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
have to trace everything that's what I'm

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.450 
have to trace everything that's what I'm
gonna<00:04:36.510> have<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.810> do<00:04:36.930> paint<00:04:37.860> yes<00:04:40.160> okay<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.190> I

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
gonna have to do paint yes okay so I

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.140 
gonna have to do paint yes okay so I
have<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.760> gauge<00:04:41.990> disconnected<00:04:42.990> from<00:04:43.290> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.870 

sending<00:04:48.150> unit<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.630> what<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.560> did<00:04:49.800> was<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.550> hook

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
sending unit and what I did was I hook

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.830 
sending unit and what I did was I hook
the<00:04:51.030> ohm<00:04:51.270> meter<00:04:51.920> to<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.340> sending<00:04:53.730> unit<00:04:54.060> so

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
the ohm meter to the sending unit so

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.990 
the ohm meter to the sending unit so
this<00:04:55.170> will<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:55.800> like<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.370> sending<00:04:56.700> unit

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
this will be just like the sending unit

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.150 
this will be just like the sending unit
would<00:04:57.210> be<00:04:57.270> telling<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.050> gauge<00:04:58.290> what's<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.980> on

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
would be telling a gauge what's going on

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.390 
would be telling a gauge what's going on
so<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:00.030> reading<00:05:00.470> 792<00:05:01.470> ohms<00:05:01.680> which<00:05:02.130> means

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
so it's reading 792 ohms which means

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.250 
so it's reading 792 ohms which means
it's<00:05:02.670> colder<00:05:03.030> than<00:05:03.060> 100<00:05:03.570> degrees<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.140> the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
it's colder than 100 degrees and the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.770 
it's colder than 100 degrees and the
engine<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.680> pretty<00:05:05.520> cold<00:05:05.790> because<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.300> it's

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
engine is pretty cold because I it's

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.200 
engine is pretty cold because I it's
been<00:05:06.960> off<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.290> about<00:05:07.350> an<00:05:07.590> hour<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.010> we<00:05:08.940> got<00:05:09.180> a

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
been off for about an hour so we got a

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.670 
been off for about an hour so we got a
to<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> ground<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:11.250> as<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.700> engine<00:05:12.000> warms<00:05:12.300> up

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
to the ground so as the engine warms up

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.320 
to the ground so as the engine warms up
this<00:05:13.680> resistance<00:05:14.310> should<00:05:14.520> go<00:05:14.700> down<00:05:14.910> let's<00:05:15.210> see

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
this resistance should go down let's see

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:24.420 
this resistance should go down let's see
what<00:05:15.450> happens

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:51.820 

that's<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.730> sending<00:05:25.150> unit

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.320 

you<00:05:51.889> know<00:05:51.979> it's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
you know it's

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.860 
you know it's
it<00:05:53.659> looks<00:05:53.840> like<00:05:54.050> is<00:05:54.169> okay

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.690 

boy

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.010 

that's<00:06:07.210> how<00:06:07.390> you<00:06:07.450> can<00:06:07.630> check<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:08.020> setting

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.760 

you<00:06:11.110> put<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.440> gauge<00:06:11.680> on<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.979> Doughboy

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:35.570 

but<00:06:18.069> shall<00:06:18.310> see<00:06:18.550> where<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:18.759> settles<00:06:19.120> out

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.640 

so<00:06:36.120> that's<00:06:36.690> about<00:06:36.900> right

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.290 

85<00:06:40.550> is<00:06:41.080> 220<00:06:42.080> 20<00:06:42.620> degrees<00:06:43.240> 600<00:06:44.240> is<00:06:44.330> 100

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
85 is 220 20 degrees 600 is 100

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.890 
85 is 220 20 degrees 600 is 100
it's<00:06:46.690> like<00:06:46.900> right<00:06:47.170> between<00:06:47.350> ER

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.760 

well

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
well

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.510 
well
that<00:06:52.280> overheat<00:06:52.640> message

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
that overheat message

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.849 
that overheat message
anyway
