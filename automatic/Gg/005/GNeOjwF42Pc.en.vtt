00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
 especially for mothers with children 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 It is a healthy recipe a healthy one 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.990
 bread and a healthy plate, too 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.820
 even tastes better than that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.920
 original i love my kids 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 I show you first the ingredients 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.170
 I have the ingredients again below 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.210
 listed in the infobox you need 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.669
 250 grams slowly you can roll for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.219
 mrs sport or brown dark bread then 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 I have ground about 400 grams 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 almonds you can paint them yourself 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 or shopping caring I have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 soy sauce for the bread taste 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 care that is now one the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 you see there are no additives in it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 So no e number or something yes 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.039
 a little salt of lemon and garlic 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 but I do not necessarily like lemon 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.780
 take the flaxseed you have in the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.670
 same amount of water so once again 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 Enter 250 milliliter water 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.409
 they suck up and it gets one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 really thick mass now you just have to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 still everything with each other magnet results 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 still the soy sauce to the market has 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.979
 even the garlic that tastes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.380
 bit heartier and takes a dough 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.320
 if he did that then just 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.680
 on a baking sheet from jol still clears 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 from this hand then rolled out in 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 cut squares and I finished 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.009
 she believed so half an hour in it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.710
 had for 160 degree write to you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.729
 again everything infobox 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.979
 the boats were really delicious 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.659
 that does not taste good to my children 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.110
 after garlic in it is like that without 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.820
 sample the lovel nutella on it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.140
 there you need a little milk I have 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.850
 Almond milk last made myself 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.460
 a little mandl office or in the part 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.619

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.909

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.270
 Atlas is very good on the bread 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.270
