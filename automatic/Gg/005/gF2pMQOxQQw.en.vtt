00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.690
 we have no big surprise interests 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.380
 The Dresden Monarchs lose a relatively clear Euro very clearly with 69 to 21 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.259
 4 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.619
 the damage to hello in food 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.960
 a lot of people have suspected the traits names of course shit partially Staubach 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.619
 Assurant many many bakers for a law 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.900
 and the result said Seidenberg was very annoying 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.659
 that happened 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.589
 our other failures 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.659
 his front man for publishers spokesman 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.370
 how do you like the result but the game has for me 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.660
 Tomorrow the game was as it was 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.030
 most had even announced an expert 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.760
 our game was the same as Season to the guard drive 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.400
 Carmen hard drive downhill 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.740
 Essen responded accordingly that the lawsuit took took place after that 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.410
 Fuel sent so this man then only 5 in this situation 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.140
 dissatisfied was the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.320
 Game history ago 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 and also for me no reproach 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.150
 Truck driver was there in the mouth and jet set to hear that the months exactly 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.830
 have chosen this tactic 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.700
 It's probably theirs to play for the year 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 Crosses lead diesel for there 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.940
 These cause harm to us 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 Arrest the damage percent to get the playoffs they have with it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 made 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 Percent before at 5 2 500 euros should you ever 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.970
 Century playable unilaterally 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 the value is clearly percent the result she says 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.280
 so there is not much to say about that woman cares 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.230
 maybe because of his facebook page 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.290
 Percent it went - that will watch very many Turnover State Opera 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.869
 could 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.080
 not only expertise but also on the part of the Hesse 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.390
 Percent among other things the weird Pocher our elite is last week 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.680
 Percent expected 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.999
 Each year, with 5 8 percent, both players would be recorded 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.570
 But since both sides down to the premise was just too big 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.840
 the substitutes on Demand bit 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.560
 faster and fresher 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 that's just how you lead in such a game with so much advantage 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.490
 simply lost by a game 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.860
 the supervisory board the air force nor the help the lot 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.709
 by Jörg ZSCHOCHE 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.039
 she said everything according to the game anyway 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.659
 Sam 50 so Washington 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.109
 the game was 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.529
 because of the situation still quite considerable 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.069
 play an important role for the city with all 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.690
 Percent while all animals the Sassenberger will have us 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:24.060
 on 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.460
 Domestic most had to write down the fire department so much again 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.639
 have fallen 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.409
 So there are also many turnover percent 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.260
 On top of that, of course, we have a lot of luck in our band percent 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.369
 as many have guessed 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.980
 I would like to raise his name 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.599
 Mike Mohring challenges Twister for my door 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.729
 he had 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:48.039
 the mom was played through Orlovski move was actually benefit from 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.019
 to 5 percent 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.599
 in front of the staff 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.060
 on the turn only play their exclusive morning on 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.969
 the point 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.199
 In addition, under a mountain André easily got help here and there in 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.430
 Form of a pullback Roche maybe played parts today 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.049
 Has 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.619
 as well as the New Yorker also bull worldwide percent 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.319
 has changed 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.699
 more because we did not play it mainly as a full world 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.679
 so far percent e-books a big compliment to the guys is that 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.019
 have pulled through 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.289
 For example, he has already made percent of André easy 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.629
 Percent Denzel works has caught as a percent three dancers compass so here 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.919
 celebrate percent involved tomorrow Christa and Jens Müller approx 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.019
 So that's a percentage compliment to ours that they like this game 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.209
 have accepted and drive from it 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.429
 yes, to do their utmost, of course, all in all not round 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.379
 runs into a counter the wording staff is missing Dobernig is used 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.809
 this task was succeeded not only come at 14 o'clock 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.449
 Percent we still have a few finals and sons collected together 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.219
 Slightly higher at the beginning of the week 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.399
 with Sam Martin Pfister 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.399
 Being here thus gives his impression of this game 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.259
 he has 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.420
 I was very vulnerable as a young player 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.599
 the desire sometime to play mister all game over 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.170
 Of course, do not be surprised Rostock 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.040
 Peter Iven as the bride and groom had to go upstairs 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.319
 the permanent reserve was what was correct 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.469
 now I have the chance that should make me happy Nordhausen of course 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.360
 as far as the middle of Martin Kistner and so the whole matter would 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.669
 I forgot a name alias bed squad had for ours 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.400
 nevertheless an interception caught out there before by a Porsche 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.300
 made 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.360
 but as already mentioned Ferrante easily he has now almost 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.979
 played through as a way has done his job very well and also him 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.930
 we asked how he found the game but decided that both were 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.680
 all races of the world rulers made here his opinion about the game 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.270
 Forget 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.590
 through the fast 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.870
 the union a fallen friend or not 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.870
 pay a single jump 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
 but I want the guy or for that 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.059
 that the sounds are our ears 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.729
 Acom players who have been basically stauber today so by that 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.719
 Congratulations to everyone who could talk through 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.840
 last, only the divas Sculpture percent Thomas Stangier 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.050
 unfortunately, there was something negative to say, even Thomas became 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.279
 Steinke had to say about the progress and the result of the game 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.449
 so took 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.650
 unfortunately, God 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.629
 an injury prop 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.129
 Krechel suspicion open 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.709
 Baden-Baden, too, will turn out to be Frederick's problem 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.219
 either much more 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.069
 the only run percent that can compensate this year already 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.809
 one or the other injury must compensate otherwise the is 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:42.740
 entire team 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.139
 Healthy Living We certainly could take some powerful either place 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.139
 but difficult games are also in Marburg 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.620
 yes we are already dead 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.820
 Rolf I always thank you for your support 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.840
 which was always happy to accept was simple only here I hope we see each other 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.529
 then next year maybe again 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.800
 we have to say it's my pleasure 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.610
 always with full or shorten otherwise moderate and Jürgen beautiful 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.960
 Timo Maxfield success in the clergy and who are in late summer in Trofaiach in 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.020
 Traunstein exciting says 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.050
 in Frankfurt 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.409
 we hope that as we said everything only a little far well but attacked itself 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.090
 if you really should be there but the agreement would be 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.999
 or other window background 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.639
 we may see it next year we will be against food again 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.960
 play 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.050
 congratulations to Essen and to the entry into the playoffs 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.430
 Happy next week 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.780
 against the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns heavy game but still I think 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.550
 sometimes with the way food has occurred 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.770
 not only precious not only the latter but the happy to worry 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.469
 despite all solvable task 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.019
 Fluence for the dreary Everyday's next week on Sunday 

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:49.129
 Marburg 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.029
 to the quarterfinals 16 Robert look at his 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.589
 and teacher, of course, again in full cast with Kristian 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:58.770
 Percent at the start we will be broadcasting the game live apn 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.830
 Then 15 clock 45 about Center to hear 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.339
 until then I still wish you at home 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.020
 and Sunday is off to a nice week 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.500
 make something of it and know until next Sunday
