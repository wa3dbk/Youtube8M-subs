00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.570
 what to go on the adventure 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 but no no 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.150
 in good all friends and you how are you? 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.680
 they are because I am very well you know 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.950
 that my name is Pablo and today I bring you 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 a real reason for challenge in the line craft 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.769
 and today I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 dress as well as the wardrobe 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.420
 this is the design is quite simple 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.900
 the idea is that it is stuck to a wall 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.050
 it does not matter which 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.940
 active and it works ok that here I remove it 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.450
 ok but I'm going to teach you how to build it 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.710
 step by step what we are going to need are 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.660
 the following materials 11 redstone 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.720
 four dispensers one plate 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.610
 pressure of wood or stone of equal 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.700
 in this case choose the wooden 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.880
 the armor that we want to put for 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.390
 equip the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.310
 the stone in this case the stone is not 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.680
 so necessary I am going to use it for 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.700
 make the back wall so that for 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.979
 give the example well 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.259
 and this peak is because as this of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.740
 survival to help him do this but 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.649
 everything is up to the armor 11 rest 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 four dispensers one pressure plate 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.819
 helmet put on pants and shoes I'm going to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 leave a little bit a note here and now 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.290
 it works and I'm going to show you how 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.170
 works 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.900
 we start with the eps and your own 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.870
 pressure we put a dispenser here another 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.300
 here another one here we already have the three 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.540
 first dispensers for the project 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.940
 is you already know what is this about this 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.610
 that we're going to give the shift key that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.000
 it's under the maius pad and we're going to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.440
 give him the credit and until the block the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.240
 stone blocks you already know that the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:02.020
 wizards how to contribute here 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 now let's dig a hole 1 2 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 one 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:16.910
 we are going to chop around here so let's go 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:19.390
 doing so let's do like this like this 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.170
 so so 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.900
 it's the same you have to put a block and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.510
 same as material 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 and I think I was wrong 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 let me put a second descriptive 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.170
 and something 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.990
 go silly but good the table 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 statement about life for something 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.200
 forget to make me 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.670
 is the basis of this you will see so that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.250
 this the slaps are necessary of the blog or 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.210
 be the floor if you do not want to be noticed 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.270
 much the reception from behind is worth 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.270
 that a little what you do here like this 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.400
 so you can see and even grant a ready 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 for this 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.040
 this we put and now for this to 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.440
 putting it does not cut the trace signal 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 of the signal can pass under the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.670
 block key and that then 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.650
 it's interesting now that we're going to 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.740
 to do is the mechanism is already 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.760
 I will completely do it in the 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.910
 wall to acclimate this 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.560
 no it is not totally necessary but good 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.910
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to do 2 x 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:08.430
 2 and well I'll do it like that like that 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:12.910
 so like that, like that way like this and these are always 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.570
 well could also put him to put 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.910
 up here yes but it does not matter this is 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.570
 decoration and so as not to 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.070
 note a lot 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.070
 let's say that this would be 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:32.040
 we wanted to put the armor already for 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.529
 equip it the us here prepared is 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.229
 as simple as this 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:40.099
 Now what are we going to do? Let's do 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.099
 one next 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.050
 now 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.970
 we are going to see that it is totally 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.680
 prepared to do let's say that those 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.720
 eyes since it is the mining or case 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.530
 of anything and we see our greatest 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.520
 and today I want to leave I'm going to love 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.520
 winning is that simple so I hope 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.880
 that you liked this tutorial that 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.750
 it's quite simple they do not use many 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.440
 resources are few the truth 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.020
 for something as interesting as this 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.920
 grant these four dispensers 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.840
 you can also use no piston nor 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.300
 repeaters led by style like this 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.220
 I hope you liked it, you know 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:34.090
 that my name is those of Pablo or 1725 and 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.100
 see you until the next but before 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.729
 go I have to say 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.029
 in the hostel 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.509
 no but joke I leave you with the city of 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.550
 know what will happen if they are bad 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.629
 news the truth but good was already 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.779
