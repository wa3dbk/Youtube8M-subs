00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.350 
Boulder except it's above everything
else<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.580> pygmies<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.120> all<00:02:42.180> walk

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.630 
else so if you the pygmies will all walk
behind<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:45.210> that's<00:02:46.110> pretty<00:02:46.470> much<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.740> it's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
behind it and that's pretty much it it's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.510

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you can do everything to pygmy so you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380
