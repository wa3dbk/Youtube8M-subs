lot of hype and the reason I got it was

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.020

because I had a chance to look them all
over<00:01:27.329> and<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.719> heaviest<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
over and this is the heaviest of the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
over and this is the heaviest of the
bunch<00:01:28.530> they're<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.219> very<00:01:29.399> heavy<00:01:29.579> that's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
bunch they're not very heavy that's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
bunch they're not very heavy that's
something<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.719> really<00:01:30.899> want<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> made

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
something you really want to be made

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
something you really want to be made
aware<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> some<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.299> ones<00:01:33.509> most<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
aware of some of the other ones most of

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.270 
aware of some of the other ones most of
the<00:01:34.289> other<00:01:34.409> ones<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the other ones I think are all about a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520 
the other ones I think are all about a
quarter<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.789> ounce<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.289> probably

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
quarter of an ounce so this is probably

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
quarter of an ounce so this is probably
not<00:01:37.649> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.070> best<00:01:38.310> lure<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.109 
bait caster but in terms of distance
that's<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:49.109> big<00:01:49.350> casters<00:01:49.799> Forte<00:01:50.250> unless

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that's not most big casters Forte unless

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.810 
that's not most big casters Forte unless
you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.899> small<00:01:52.549> finesse<00:01:53.549> type

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you have a really small finesse type

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
you have a really small finesse type
type<00:01:54.359> reel<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.380> anyway<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:55.979> why<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> went

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
type reel so anyway that's why I went

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.529 
type reel so anyway that's why I went
with<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> has<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
with this one because it has a little

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.109 
with this one because it has a little
bit<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> extra<00:01:58.020> weight<00:01:58.200> into<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.640> 5/16<00:01:59.640> amps

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bit of extra weight into it 5/16 amps

of glitter in it the scales on the side

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.440 
of glitter in it the scales on the side
as<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.360> see<00:02:53.430> from<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.580> bottom<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.270> get<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
as you can see from the bottom you get a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.060 
as you can see from the bottom you get a
feel<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.959> shape<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:59.550> top<00:03:02.070> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
feel for the shape of it the top and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.190 
feel for the shape of it the top and
from<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> side<00:03:04.000> okay<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.540> let's<00:03:07.840> take<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.989> close

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
from the side okay so let's take a close

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.009 
from the side okay so let's take a close
look<00:03:08.290> at<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.500> lip<00:03:09.239> let's<00:03:10.239> get<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.540> focus<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
look at that lip let's get to focus a

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:19.860 
look at that lip let's get to focus a
little<00:03:11.110> closer<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.920> we<00:03:18.069> go

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
little closer here here we go

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.119 
little closer here here we go
so<00:03:20.440> there's<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.800> lip<00:03:22.650> very<00:03:23.650> interesting

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
so there's that lip very interesting

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.680 
so there's that lip very interesting
design<00:03:24.310> one<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.180> things<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.540> was

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
design one of the things that I was

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.100 
design one of the things that I was
curious<00:03:26.019> about<00:03:26.110> because<00:03:26.290> um<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.840> I'm

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
curious about because um you know I'm

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.750 
curious about because um you know I'm
I'm<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.800> fish<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.129> I<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:30.459> going<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.640> wait

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
I'm going to fish it I was going to wait

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.940 
I'm going to fish it I was going to wait
to<00:03:30.879> fish<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.239> do<00:03:31.360> this<00:03:31.510> reviewing<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to fish to do this reviewing it but you

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.619 
to fish to do this reviewing it but you
know<00:03:33.069> what<00:03:33.220> there<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.489> can't<00:03:33.879> do<00:03:34.390> anything

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
know what there I can't do anything

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.289 
know what there I can't do anything
better<00:03:34.900> than<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.920> videos<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.489> Rapala<00:03:37.090> has

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
better than the videos that Rapala has

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.550 
better than the videos that Rapala has
out<00:03:37.510> there<00:03:37.540> there's<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> couple<00:03:38.080> excellent

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
out there there's a couple excellent

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.220 
out there there's a couple excellent
videos<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.819> show<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.239> bait<00:03:40.540> in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
videos and they show this bait in

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.780 
videos and they show this bait in
comparison<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> normal<00:03:42.190> crank<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.670> they

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
comparison to a normal crank and they

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.220 
comparison to a normal crank and they
show<00:03:42.940> kind<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.180> like<00:03:43.269> an<00:03:43.360> aerial<00:03:43.750> view<00:03:43.780> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
show kind of like an aerial view and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.339 
show kind of like an aerial view and
they<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> line<00:03:46.140> designating<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:47.319> a

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
they have a line designating like a

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.350 
they have a line designating like a
centering<00:03:48.040> line<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.549> they<00:03:48.640> show<00:03:48.879> how<00:03:49.030> normal

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
centering line and they show how normal

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.780 
centering line and they show how normal
crank<00:03:49.599> runs<00:03:49.900> along<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.410> line<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.890> how<00:03:51.549> this

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
crank runs along that line and how this

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.110 
crank runs along that line and how this
crank<00:03:52.480> here<00:03:52.750> kind<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.349> darts<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.519> know

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
crank here kind of like darts you know

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.940 
crank here kind of like darts you know
around<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.540> line<00:03:55.690> but<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.959> always<00:03:56.140> comes<00:03:56.620> back

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
around the line but it always comes back

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.520 
around the line but it always comes back
to<00:03:57.360> center<00:03:58.360> at<00:03:58.540> least<00:03:58.720> momentarily<00:03:59.260> before

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
to center at least momentarily before

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.300 
to center at least momentarily before
then<00:03:59.890> choosing<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.880> go<00:04:01.030> left<00:04:01.540> or<00:04:01.660> right<00:04:01.720> again

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
then choosing to go left or right again

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.000 
then choosing to go left or right again
so<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:04.629> know<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.959> going<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.140> wait<00:04:05.379> but<00:04:05.890> then

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so you know I was going to wait but then

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.770 
so you know I was going to wait but then
I<00:04:06.099> figured<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:07.030> know<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.150> can't<00:04:07.420> really<00:04:07.510> show

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
I figured you know I can't really show

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.699 
I figured you know I can't really show
you<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> don't<00:04:08.170> have<00:04:08.349> an<00:04:08.500> underwater

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
you that I don't have an underwater

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.180 
you that I don't have an underwater
camera<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:11.140> those<00:04:11.260> videos<00:04:11.620> are<00:04:11.799> great<00:04:11.890> at

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
camera and and those videos are great at

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.069 
camera and and those videos are great at
showing<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:13.269> exactly<00:04:13.390> it's<00:04:13.870> going<00:04:14.019> to

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
showing you what exactly it's going to

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.900 
showing you what exactly it's going to
do<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.890> reason<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.160> mention<00:04:15.489> all<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.790> was

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
do but the reason I mention all that was

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.370 
do but the reason I mention all that was
because<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.209> was<00:04:16.299> curious<00:04:16.660> when<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.959> got<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.320> if

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
because I was curious when I got it if

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.069 
because I was curious when I got it if
there<00:04:17.590> was<00:04:17.620> any<00:04:17.949> irregularity<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.090> lip<00:04:19.329> if

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
there was any irregularity to the lip if

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.860 
there was any irregularity to the lip if
it<00:04:20.289> was<00:04:20.440> going<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.889> be<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.459> guess<00:04:22.120> proportional

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
it was going to be I guess proportional

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.010 
it was going to be I guess proportional
on<00:04:23.080> both<00:04:23.650> sides<00:04:24.479> or<00:04:25.479> if<00:04:25.630> there's<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.960> be

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
on both sides or if there's going to be

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.529 
on both sides or if there's going to be
like<00:04:26.410> any<00:04:26.560> kind<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:26.950> skewing<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.610> lip<00:04:27.820> to

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
like any kind of skewing of the lip to

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.420 
like any kind of skewing of the lip to
one<00:04:28.720> side<00:04:28.960> or<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.260> other<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.310> there

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
one side or the other and and there

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.090
