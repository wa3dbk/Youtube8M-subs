00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.310 
mode which we're not gonna be able to
use<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.710> today<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:31.320> 65

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
use that today because it is a 65

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.700 
use that today because it is a 65
degrees<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.860> very<00:02:33.070> sunny<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.230> next<00:02:35.470> mode<00:02:35.680> is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
degrees and very sunny the next mode is

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.040 
degrees and very sunny the next mode is
the<00:02:35.920> mud<00:02:36.130> mode<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> sand

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the mud mode and then you have a sand

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.330 
the mud mode and then you have a sand
mode<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.860> basically<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.520> does<00:02:39.550> is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
mode and basically what it does is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.340 
mode and basically what it does is
recalibrate<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.850> throttle<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:44.020> all-wheel

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
recalibrate the throttle the all-wheel

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.170 
recalibrate the throttle the all-wheel
drive<00:02:44.590> system<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.070> varying<00:02:45.700> traction

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
drive system for varying traction

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.430 
drive system for varying traction
conditions<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.840> help<00:02:47.020> enable<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:49.440> prevent

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
conditions to help enable you or prevent

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.390 
conditions to help enable you or prevent
you<00:02:50.530> from<00:02:50.560> getting<00:02:50.980> stuck<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.840> stranded

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.890 

so<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.580> looks<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.910> lot<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.540> display

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
so this looks a lot like the display

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.470 
so this looks a lot like the display
audio<00:03:01.110> system<00:03:01.709> we've<00:03:02.040> seen<00:03:02.310> already<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
audio system we've seen already in the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.199 
audio system we've seen already in the
cars<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.990> fit<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> Civic<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> CRV<00:03:05.490> but

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
cars like the fit the Civic the CRV but

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.130 
cars like the fit the Civic the CRV but
this<00:03:06.569> one<00:03:06.750> runs<00:03:06.990> Android<00:03:07.770> auto<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.580> now<00:03:09.420> has<00:03:09.870> a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
this one runs Android auto and now has a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.650 
this one runs Android auto and now has a
Garmin<00:03:10.890> navigation<00:03:11.819> system<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.450> see

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
Garmin navigation system so you can see

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
Garmin navigation system so you can see
the<00:03:12.780> graphics<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:14.700> bit<00:03:14.819> richer

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the graphics a little little bit richer

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
the graphics a little little bit richer
than<00:03:15.420> previous<00:03:16.319> Honda<00:03:16.650> navigation<00:03:17.130> systems<00:03:17.520> I

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
than previous Honda navigation systems I

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.729 
than previous Honda navigation systems I
believe<00:03:18.330> there's<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.569> 3d<00:03:18.989> viewing<00:03:19.260> mode<00:03:19.560> like

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
believe there's a 3d viewing mode like

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.050 
believe there's a 3d viewing mode like
if<00:03:19.890> you're<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.130> city<00:03:20.340> it'll<00:03:20.550> actually<00:03:20.850> throw

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
if you're in a city it'll actually throw

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
if you're in a city it'll actually throw
buildings<00:03:21.450> up<00:03:21.660> there<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.890> of

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
buildings up there so you can kind of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.490 
buildings up there so you can kind of
navigate<00:03:23.100> by<00:03:23.700> sight<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> see<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> buildings

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
navigate by sight and see the buildings

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
navigate by sight and see the buildings
that<00:03:25.560> are<00:03:25.680> as<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.010> pass<00:03:26.340> by<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:27.600> has<00:03:27.750> your

typical<00:03:28.140> traffic<00:03:29.480> integration<00:03:30.480> system<00:03:30.900> it'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
typical traffic integration system it'll

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.949 
typical traffic integration system it'll
reroute<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.590> around<00:03:31.890> traffic<00:03:32.810> tangles<00:03:33.810> and

the<00:03:49.860> HVAC<00:03:50.700> system<00:03:51.830> thankfully<00:03:52.830> most<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
the HVAC system thankfully most of it's

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.830 
the HVAC system thankfully most of it's
controlled<00:03:53.790> by<00:03:53.970> buttons<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.510> not<00:03:54.630> through

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
the EXL you get a DVD based player but
