00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.230
 the e-mail is his owl only in 2007 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.029
 this version of soccer simulator 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.939
 It's nothing more than regretting it later. 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.980
 almost the same updates after the disappearance of six 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.590
 launched at the end of 2006 in europe the seresta is in export 360 with great 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.900
 style and probably because you say goodbye to playstation 2 without letting the ball fall 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 the konami begins to whittle a bit more in the aesthetic appeal of the biennium one 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.520
 stylish presentation 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.530
 the game options are relatively benign there are various forms of dispute 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.830
 this is an individual game to have a lifetime 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 even without the level of difficulty that counts with the main teams of the world to 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 is the luxury beach 2007 that brings enough official teams with 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
 Reform studies and seven correct squad names updated 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.629
 in the first editions of spain italy holland in france 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 this last one the novelty of the edition however the band in itself German league was 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.799
 cut 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.799
 leaving only one and munich to tell the story 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.450
 besides part of the loose officers as is the case of the manchester remedies 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.000
 united olympiacos benfica this post 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.410
 as well as representatives from several european countries 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.030
 as usual 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.860
 in that category and India all invented 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.650
 as is the case of bald 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.009
 Based in the São Paulo Football Club 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.290
 the only Brazilian association of the present 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.430
 in terms of national teams having an affair with his Brazil officials with 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 the world cup installation has only real names but I did not graduate 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.399
 at least such limitations can be circumvented 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.420
 the editors of the game 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 at least on playstation 2 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 after the blessing of export 360 opted in the area of ​​options 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.690
 the consolidations in a way of game to more quinito the qualifiers of the cups 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.020
 of europe from south america the entire concacaf region 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.269
 no export 300 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.569
 60 still lacked options to save and litigation 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.639
 and statistical analysis 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.679
 rest 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 all other options are present 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.639
 a master b 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.509
 that transform players and athletes medical technicians and administrators 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.229
 having to look after the finances of the club and the buying and selling of players 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.939
 but when the judge whistles the start of the match 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.029
 the groom in the 2007 census 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.779
 showed why he is considered a genius who most translates the emotions of football 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.409
 to the animations of the players who have always been featured 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.120
 well improving each edition all the tricks and movements of the athletes 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.559
 in a real match 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.559
 goalkeepers also improved a lot in the rebound field 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.709
 players respond to controls quickly and run 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.339
 will come with skill at least those who are so in real life 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:09.479
 the judge also seemed insecure only this time parading up the paths 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.479
 collar with more freedom 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 the only point of imbalance seems to be the larger athletes who have 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.169
 enough advantage over their opponents to keep possession of the ball 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.499
 the opponents boom pow 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.499
 all this is worth in the version for xbox 360 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.269
 except for the rhythm of the match 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.659
 which seems more timed 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.420
 who has 5 million reports that serve both those who have never seen and 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.639
 it makes me happy 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.069
 so much so that in 2000 I am all editions 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.579
 I did not pay are two studies are bought as wrong while 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.720
 marques borges 360 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.290
 are released while completing the tasks like completing the cougar canopy 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.899
 always been playing against other players 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.000
 and in that question 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.669
 playstation 2 also takes advantage of 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.589
 not just because it emits up to eight players 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.719
 whether on the same machine or over the internet 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.699
 but by bringing a cooperative mode 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.779
 no export 360 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.219
 the apple support that local users and May 2 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.229
 the performance of kinect xbox live and bing 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.900
 mainly on 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 is very abundant waiting for opponents 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.349
 It's really the country of football. 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.320
 or export 360 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.330
 takes great advantage of the visual 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 naturally because it is one with your life 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:35.939
 However 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.289
 all this potential 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.879
 does not seem to have been used 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.900
 the images are more inclined 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.849
 thanks to high resolution 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.120
 but things are very loaded 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.250
 and the textures 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.939
 not so defined 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.739
 the result are 3d models that look like artificial benno wax dolls 

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.550
 version for playstation 2 as neither the details 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.469
 but it seems firmer 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.850
 I took pro evolution soccer 2007 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.160
 maintain the qualities of their predecessors and have seriously made the myth 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.270
 the premiere for export 360 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.030
 is not spectacular but the essential feature and especially now that 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.030
 they see who thinks when playing against other people 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.199
 or gather friends by taking cons by the media anyway the email 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.989
 event continues to hit a bump
