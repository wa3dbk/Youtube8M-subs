00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 similarly in the part 4 inches are part i will describe you what are 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.149
 the carburetor mechanical parts that make it possible to say that we must do 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.069
 evolve 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.199
 levy vary fuel prices in this cable 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.429
 so that if we observe 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.939
 inside this site are so weak that it does not criticize the May 10 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.669
 following the diffuser 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.669
 if the small tubes that we see on the left side kuyt the diameters 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.339
 aymeric silvert 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.730
 here is the end of the tour of the island where he was expressing broadcasters 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.229
 biological or predict 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.130
 it's at the end of this road tube 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.660
 pear tree fuel 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 than the twenty or so areas by its passage it diffuses fuel and fines 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240
 droplets that will create a gas mixture 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.620
 but angers l2 that is going to be sucked not now 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770
 so it's crucial to make it happen 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.720
 at the end of his tubes 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.230
 the exact amount of fuel desired 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230
 so it's interesting to come out in this case the bushel 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 to understand 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
 what happens upstream of this tube 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 the causes temporarily the driver mentions aside 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 and we notice 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.100
 and a small side cylinder 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.260
 there is no way to access the internet what since farms here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 apart from 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
 a small slit 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.800
 and in this slot there is a character 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 so all the fuel 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.619
 who arrived 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 at the end of the diffuser 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.460
 must go through this time 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 so if in a different way and we see everything 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.780
 ample botanists 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.820
 we see very well that you are investigating the centering the tightness 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.740
 it occurs in the act of the bushel 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 it is a choice that is to complain about small index or release on the left 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.790
 of the screen currently 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270
 one of these dexia buns discuss a central we see that there is a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.800
 lemieux who cooked if I can say that we see we feared 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.350
 it allows to synchronize in position 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 these are the two so that the convoy turns 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 the micro bosso all also have 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.300
 essonne in the operation it's fundamental 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 gold so that the position of dead in relation to each other is extremely 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719
 accurate and an adjustment remedy 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.869
 tooling 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.849
 between the two 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.790
 another contest here is not an air hole fuels or exits 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.790
 fuel it's just the pair of meters installed since 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.650
 once we understand that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.369
 we consider the bushel as an entity 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.699
 in full 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.740
 in the rotation of sita-suez by the brain eyi 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.299
 richard holbrooke 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.149
 the position of light 2 these 30 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.679
 so you tell me mike keenan yet and a fuels stop in there 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.879
 it does not have to be in a parallel section somewhere 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.049
 and that we go back 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.159
 the greens the body of the fuel 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.450
 and we see here 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.009
 then to several pieces 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.069
 we will release this little room 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.609
 who is immobilized years 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.769
 translation by sony this district biscayne fla rochus 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.339
 he had gone down one prefers to pay the bill 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.219
 with the ump the washer later adjoined here kulikov function of 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.409
 maintain a throat 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.739
 they fear throat and maintain the translation position to flatten themselves which 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.739
 I did not see his lists 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.899
 the project came out 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.129
 I could take out the little book carefully on the list 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.609
 and here I go 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.629
 the pdci-rda 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.039
 we notice that it is centered or ailer 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.749
 now position no need 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.629
 it's seals on sealing and knowing that the outer part of 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.629
 knowingly makes tournaments and fuel 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.699
 if we look more precisely 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.749
 the body of the carburettor we observe a drilling here 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.699
 match the room rent 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.089
 burton talked about yesterday yesterday's two-pointed documentary 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.809
 so the fuel arrives because too slow 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:57.069
 q in the position 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.540
 so it's a place 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.509
 Brass 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.110
 what did I think about 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.479
 in all the experience of the brass cylinder between the two players 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.859
 so returned from joy and around these rents fuel 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.740
 so on the video that I recommend you 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.279
 during all this way 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.929
 you can see 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.579
 plus a cylinder 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.139
 compaq lesley the plans so you can not understand how the 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.139
 fuel passes through a prism but if i return the plate 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.749
 the cut discovering us and a cynical and debating 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.980
 alas if I take my micro bosso 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.889
 and that I put in place 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.330
 as C 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.830
 the position as if calculating the amount raised 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.199
 cylinder 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.800
 pure narrator 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.599
 you see more 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.360
 the slot find ample single market been very good over six years in 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.090
 the weather 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.220
 it's shame at the bottom 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.520
 we can understand how this innovative sector works 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.070
 if we consider that the plate part being effective 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.060
 what is the case actually white sharks time to go up and the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.779
 mobile relative part which is the bushel 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.400
 and that's what the fact 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.699
 I know but vichy 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.289
 the position 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.999
 in rotation 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.020
 bushel 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.110
 I keep from fixed rates 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.689
 what happens is that as 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.199
 bleeding 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.199
 leave for staff on staff and promotions 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.999
 kode5 signed triangular 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.580
 but that of fernand voting on the bushel 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.360
 but obtained gradually and almost linearly from the section 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.999
 fuel that was offered 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:26.520
 at 10 years fuel pressure 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.349
 you have not forgotten we have pressure 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.870
 of fuel all around these in brighton 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.020
 and between the two groups 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.240
 who just wants to escape go further 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.689
 if I close totally like it is now 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.400
 no fuel passes 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.080
 if I turn my boss or 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.659
 I begin to expose the gers seigner 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.080
 so the fuel passes with a little bug if I continue to open the signum 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.759
 years 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.210
 if I open totally 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.520
 we have in front the first to sign on all the characters who represent 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.889
 the maximum flow 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.740
 fuel has to pass in convoys jump 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.680
 limoges blow diffuser parents inspiration it's small it was 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.110
 evacuated in the engine so it is certain of its burning death 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.039
 so the functioning of this degree participate in the convoys blow 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.300
 I wish more extremely accurate 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.300
 in part 5 of this video i will show you why 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.419
 it's gone we're all after rotational movements 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.639
 very specific associates
