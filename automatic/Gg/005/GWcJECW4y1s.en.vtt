look very cost and unprofessional
it<00:01:22.820> will<00:01:22.970> also<00:01:23.090> shorten<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.810> light

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
it will also shorten the light

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.320 
it will also shorten the light
especially<00:01:24.680> what's<00:01:25.130> being<00:01:25.280> used<00:01:25.520> exteriorly

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
especially what's being used exteriorly

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.510 
especially what's being used exteriorly
is<00:01:26.539> being<00:01:26.869> used<00:01:26.990> outside<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.680> water<00:01:28.250> on

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
is being used outside the water on

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.249 
is being used outside the water on
against<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:28.940> there<00:01:29.119> it'll<00:01:29.360> damage<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.080> board

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
against in there it'll damage the board

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.320 
against in there it'll damage the board
so<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:31.430> I'm<00:01:31.520> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.789> now<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.180> we're

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
so what I'm going to do now is we're

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.630 
so what I'm going to do now is we're
going<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.690> go<00:01:32.960> through<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.200> basic<00:01:33.590> process<00:01:34.190> of

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
going to go through the basic process of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.550 
going to go through the basic process of
using<00:01:34.850> four<00:01:35.179> mix<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.600> sealing<00:01:36.050> off<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.380> edges

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
using four mix of sealing off the edges

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.260 
using four mix of sealing off the edges
I'm<00:01:37.429> treating<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.090> then<00:01:38.210> painting<00:01:40.030> start<00:01:41.030> off

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'm treating and then painting start off

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.389 
I'm treating and then painting start off
with<00:01:41.600> sanding<00:01:42.080> down<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.740> course<00:01:43.069> or<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
with sanding down the course or the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.219 
with sanding down the course or the
rough<00:01:43.610> edge<00:01:43.819> we're<00:01:44.420> going<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.659> start<00:01:44.869> out<00:01:45.020> for

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
rough edge we're going to start out for

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.320 
rough edge we're going to start out for
using<00:01:45.880> p120<00:01:46.880> sound<00:01:47.810> eight

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.270 

so<00:01:53.960> next<00:01:54.140> thing<00:01:54.260> to<00:01:54.440> do<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.860> make<00:01:54.980> sure<00:01:55.010> it's

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
so next thing to do is to make sure it's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.360 
so next thing to do is to make sure it's
nice<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.460> clean<00:01:55.670> before<00:01:56.150> we<00:01:56.330> move<00:01:56.570> on<00:01:56.810> to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
nice and clean before we move on to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.900 
nice and clean before we move on to
using<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.670> our<00:01:58.790> CNN<00:01:59.360> primer<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:01.160> what<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.760> do

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
using that our CNN primer so what we do

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.840 
using that our CNN primer so what we do
is<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.570> use<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.720> particle<00:02:03.290> or<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.680> start<00:02:03.890> 94<00:02:04.580> is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
is we use a particle or to start 94 is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.820 
is we use a particle or to start 94 is
designed<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.570> clean<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.810> plastic<00:02:06.410> soldiers

primer<00:03:35.490> Tollman<00:03:36.030> Toyz<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.900> move<00:03:36.990> on<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
primer Tollman Toyz we can move on to

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.380 
primer Tollman Toyz we can move on to
the<00:03:37.470> next<00:03:37.620> stage<00:03:37.920> which<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.790> rope<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> sort
