00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
cheeks so you could do this one of two
ways<00:00:54.329> depending<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.309> patient

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
wants to end or correct so that one way

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
wants to end or correct so that one way
to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.640> making<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> red<00:01:00.300> and

area of Janet's face that is red you can
see<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.740> strays<00:01:39.130> away<00:01:39.210> sometimes<00:01:40.210> it'll<00:01:40.390> turn

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
see it strays away sometimes it'll turn

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.480 
see it strays away sometimes it'll turn
a<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.810> purple<00:01:41.140> but<00:01:41.800> it'll<00:01:42.010> actually<00:01:42.100> wash

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
a little purple but it'll actually wash

how's<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.229> feel<00:01:45.409> like<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.579> said<00:01:46.819> like<00:01:46.999> a<00:01:47.030> rubber

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
how's it feel like I said like a rubber

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.950 
how's it feel like I said like a rubber
band<00:01:47.509> snapping<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> look<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.850> bad<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.810> this

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
band snapping so look that bad with this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.319 
band snapping so look that bad with this
unit<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:51.380> got<00:01:51.499> a<00:01:51.530> chilling<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.579> cooling<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.210> it
