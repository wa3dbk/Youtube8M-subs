idea what the hell you need 24 in the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
idea what the hell you need 24 in the
front<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.200> mean<00:03:04.350> would<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.489> better<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:05.730> they

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
front I mean would it be better if they

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.600 
front I mean would it be better if they
had<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.570> front<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.170> back

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
had like one in the front on the back

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.320 
had like one in the front on the back
actually<00:03:08.610> does<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.120> one<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.330> back<00:03:09.390> oh

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
actually does it have one in the back oh

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.650 
actually does it have one in the back oh
I<00:03:12.330> guess<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.080> does<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:14.730> three<00:03:15.000> cameras

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
I guess it does so that's three cameras

the<00:04:29.169> gimmicks<00:04:29.789> if<00:04:31.020> one<00:04:32.020> could<00:04:32.199> ever<00:04:32.350> pull<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
the gimmicks if one could ever pull it

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.450 
the gimmicks if one could ever pull it
off<00:04:32.889> and<00:04:33.010> I'll<00:04:33.130> get<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.400> later<00:04:35.460> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
off and I'll get to that later the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.650 
off and I'll get to that later the
elbows<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:36.940> bend<00:04:37.000> no<00:04:37.360> good<00:04:37.630> 8<00:04:38.530> 180<00:04:38.889> degrees

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
elbows can bend no good 8 180 degrees

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.200 
elbows can bend no good 8 180 degrees
double<00:04:40.660> joints<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.610> they<00:04:42.610> rotate<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.060> little

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
double joints and they rotate a little

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.770 
double joints and they rotate a little
bit<00:04:43.479> at<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.630> top<00:04:45.030> well<00:04:46.030> 360<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.460> hands<00:04:48.780> arana

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
bit at the top well 360 the hands arana

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.370 
bit at the top well 360 the hands arana
also<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> ball<00:04:50.590> joint<00:04:50.770> but<00:04:50.979> they<00:04:51.070> wiggle<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.729> lot

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
also a ball joint but they wiggle a lot

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.710 
also a ball joint but they wiggle a lot
thumb<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.560> separate<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.389> we<00:04:55.389> got<00:04:55.539> three

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
thumb is separate and we got three

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.610 
thumb is separate and we got three
fingers<00:04:56.110> connected<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.740> one<00:04:57.010> in<00:04:57.840> one<00:04:58.840> finger

articulated<00:05:00.610> right<00:05:00.729> there<00:05:01.030> oh<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.599> waist<00:05:01.810> can

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
articulated right there oh the waist can

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.240 
articulated right there oh the waist can
go<00:05:02.500> forward<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.270> lot<00:05:04.710> well<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:06.010> much

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
go forward like a lot well that much

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.620 
go forward like a lot well that much
which<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.729> another<00:05:06.970> which<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.419> key<00:05:07.599> for

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
which is another which is key for

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.620 
which is another which is key for
another<00:05:08.169> one<00:05:08.349> of<00:05:08.440> its<00:05:08.560> signature<00:05:08.770> poses<00:05:09.630> if

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
another one of its signature poses if

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.540 
another one of its signature poses if
you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.200> pull<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.470> off<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:13.889> look<00:05:14.889> up<00:05:15.130> quite<00:05:15.520> a

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
you can pull it off and look up quite a

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.969 
you can pull it off and look up quite a
bit<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.240> leaves<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.630> nasty<00:05:16.930> gap<00:05:17.560> in<00:05:17.770> there

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
bit but that leaves a nasty gap in there

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.310 
bit but that leaves a nasty gap in there
and<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:18.690> that's<00:05:19.690> kind<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.110> problem<00:05:20.260> I

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
and that's that's kind of a problem I

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.629 
and that's that's kind of a problem I
could<00:05:23.320> also<00:05:23.440> yeah<00:05:23.800> I'll<00:05:23.889> do<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.330> do<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.360> whole

down a bit that's about it see it so
yeah<00:06:24.720> not<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.080> best<00:06:25.160> articulation<00:06:26.160> but<00:06:26.490> it's

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
yeah not the best articulation but it's

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.690 
yeah not the best articulation but it's
still<00:06:26.910> a<00:06:26.970> bit<00:06:27.330> pretty<00:06:27.630> good<00:06:28.340> so<00:06:29.340> what's<00:06:29.520> after

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
still a bit pretty good so what's after

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.070 
still a bit pretty good so what's after
articulation<00:06:31.640> gimmicks<00:06:32.640> remember<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.660> shiny

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
articulation gimmicks remember the shiny

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.640 
articulation gimmicks remember the shiny
jewel<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.530> mentioned<00:06:35.100> before<00:06:35.900> well<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.230> takes<00:06:37.440> a

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
jewel I mentioned before well it takes a

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.560 
jewel I mentioned before well it takes a
quite<00:06:37.890> a<00:06:37.920> bit<00:06:38.100> of<00:06:38.190> effort<00:06:38.550> but<00:06:39.240> if<00:06:39.330> you<00:06:39.420> get

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
quite a bit of effort but if you get

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.020 
quite a bit of effort but if you get
your<00:06:39.750> fingernail<00:06:40.200> in<00:06:40.380> this<00:06:40.530> back<00:06:40.740> portion<00:06:41.310> you

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
your fingernail in this back portion you

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.800 
your fingernail in this back portion you
could<00:06:42.620> pull<00:06:43.620> this<00:06:43.860> out<00:06:44.190> and<00:06:47.090> reveal<00:06:48.090> a<00:06:48.150> little

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
could pull this out and reveal a little

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.130 
could pull this out and reveal a little
tiny<00:06:49.290> pilot<00:06:50.010> I'm<00:06:50.880> not<00:06:51.060> sure<00:06:51.120> who<00:06:51.570> it<00:06:51.690> is<00:06:51.810> it
