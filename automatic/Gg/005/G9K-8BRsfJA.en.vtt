00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello what's up kids are with a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 video of the encounters that a pair makes 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.540
 of days the thing that there is a fallito 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.130
 on 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.009
 when they are going to fight the issue 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.730
 is very pixilated and stays after 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.620
 the shower and it's a pain in the ass so I'm going to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 teach how 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.880
 how to solve this problem 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 good 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.470
 we are here to leave 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.470
 who goes to shower you see this frozen area 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.400
 and not 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.790
 the failure is supposed to be that we were 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.060
 here we come out of the bathroom shower of what 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.060
 to be 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.829
 really going to continue that all the time 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.410
 It is quite annoying 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 and there is a very simple way of 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.890
 fix it so I'm going to show it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.890
 Now the first thing we have to do 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.720
 is to get out of the game 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.510
 come as I have seen leave without saving but 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.700
 it's just for when I do the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.229
 Solution to be able to enter again to load 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.350
 the same game and see that everything works 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.750
 perfectly it is very easy we are not in 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.869
 the folder of the 54 we go to the folder 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.640
 of game we find it in bing and in this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.430
 same folder in the launcher 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.650
 we have to copy the name so we 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.110
 We give edit name and we give to 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.110
 copy then we go to this file 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.290
 which is that 4 point pair 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.050
 we give the right button change name and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 we give him to paste he will put himself 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.479
 name that the launcher does not 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 and we give / you already changed so 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.119
 right now and just with this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.009
 change the pixel error is removed 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.250
 totally and now I'm going to teach it from 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.250
 new 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.909
 well and here we are as you can see the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.709
 pixelated and depends a lot on each 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.250
 departure but it is usually bigger or more 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.250
 little 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.760
 what 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.660
 the pixel disappears and you can already make your 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.000
 normal life without 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:56.300
 without the pixel bothering 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.740
 Well, you know if it worked for them and it has 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.450
 liked the video 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.450

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.690
 goodbye
