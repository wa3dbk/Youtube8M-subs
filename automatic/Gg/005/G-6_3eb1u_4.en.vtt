let us have a look at the two sides

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.020 
let us have a look at the two sides
Rajasthan<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.550> moving<00:00:38.730> away

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
Rajasthan as we know are moving away

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.940 
Rajasthan as we know are moving away
from<00:00:39.210> Jaipur<00:00:39.899> which<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> their<00:00:40.350> fortress<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
from Jaipur which is their fortress and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
from Jaipur which is their fortress and
aren't<00:00:41.550> any<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> finals<00:00:42.540> how<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
aren't any for the finals how much of a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
aren't any for the finals how much of a
difference<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> make

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
difference would that make

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
difference would that make
but<00:00:45.030> remember<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.989> won<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> Eliminator

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
but remember they won the Eliminator

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.729 
but remember they won the Eliminator
here<00:00:47.250> during<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> IPL<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:49.020> Johanna<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here during the IPL I think Johanna is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
here during the IPL I think Johanna is
in<00:00:49.920> fine<00:00:50.190> form<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.730> they<00:00:51.120> also<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.600> Rahul

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
in fine form and they also have Rahul

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
in fine form and they also have Rahul
Dravid<00:00:52.079> Shane<00:00:52.649> Watson<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.370> Sanju<00:00:54.059> Sampson<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Dravid Shane Watson and Sanju Sampson in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
Dravid Shane Watson and Sanju Sampson in
their<00:00:54.809> backing<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.520> miss<00:00:56.699> Brad

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
their backing but they would miss Brad

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
their backing but they would miss Brad
Hodge<00:00:57.300> who<00:00:57.510> has<00:00:57.629> been<00:00:57.870> their<00:00:58.050> finisher<00:00:58.559> who

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Hodge who has been their finisher who

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
Hodge who has been their finisher who
would<00:00:59.670> come<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> his<00:01:00.120> place

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
would come in his place

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
would come in his place
that<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> question<00:01:01.320> perhaps<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.550> may

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that is the question perhaps they may

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
that is the question perhaps they may
try<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> rework<00:01:03.210> their<00:01:03.600> combination<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> get
