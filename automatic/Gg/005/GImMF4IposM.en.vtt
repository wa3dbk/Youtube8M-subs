00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.899
 With the new Beetle Volkswagen starts in the next Beetle round after the 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.189
 only moderately successful attempt with the predecessor New Beetle 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.999
 Picture VW now in the second attempt was finally past the cult 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.539
 After decades, the original model belongs to 21 9 5 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.439
 Millions sold copies 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.539
 to the three most successful vehicles in the world 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.519
 technically, however, the new hardly has anything in common with his 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 Grandfather and his air-cooled boxer engine in the rear 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.099
 but that now returns as a modern coupe interpretation 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.640
 the new beetle bends the bow back to the roots away from the be 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.540
 of the New Beetle 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.409
 who looked forward and backward as alike 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.409
 the new shows how the classic proportions 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 his look is his trademark 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 a heartbreaker 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 the only small spoiler of the sportiness of the new Beetle 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.900
 highlights 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 in the trunk 310 liters fit so 500 more than its predecessor 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 905 liters is the new maximum way 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.720
 The interior is much more serious and on-site is also the legendary 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 Vase 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.450
 after all, the straps as a tribute to the grandfather have remained 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.450
 with six engines, the title goes to the start, but not all 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 to have anywhere in the world 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 and it will be critical to get everywhere 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.629
 It is the most powerful petrol engine with 147 kW 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.529
 This 2-liter Tast from the Golf GTI is known to shoot the newest 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.869
 Beetle scion in seven municipalities 5 seconds 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.949
 at 100 km / h 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.610
 which offers Sahlberg is so 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 Seer lively
