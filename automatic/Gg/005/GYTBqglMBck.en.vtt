00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.949 
and alarm there can i mean two are made
but<00:03:29.520> obviously<00:03:30.300> if<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.510> want<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.780> able<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
but obviously if you want to be able to

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.360 
but obviously if you want to be able to
cheap<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:31.709> legal<00:03:31.920> squad<00:03:32.100> you're<00:03:32.250> going

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
cheap but it's legal squad you're going

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.540 
cheap but it's legal squad you're going
to<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:33.330> pick<00:03:33.570> up<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.720> rough<00:03:33.900> enya<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:35.280> he<00:03:35.430> is

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
to go pick up a rough enya because he is

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.699 
to go pick up a rough enya because he is
probably<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> best<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.260> ask<00:03:37.410> me

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
probably the best one if you ask me

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.680 
probably the best one if you ask me
that's<00:03:37.890> cheaper<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.730> come<00:03:39.420> on<00:03:39.510> over<00:03:39.570> let's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
that's cheaper so come on over let's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.930 
that's cheaper so come on over let's
move<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> next<00:03:40.800> park<00:03:41.160> fifth<00:03:41.550> pack<00:03:41.820> I

move on it to the next park fifth pack I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.720 
move on it to the next park fifth pack I
think<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.240> is<00:03:42.450> Matt<00:03:42.840> Markey<00:03:43.200> Co<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:44.400> bad

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
think this is Matt Markey Co not bad

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.630 
think this is Matt Markey Co not bad
which<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.480> brt<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.500> will<00:03:46.920> place<00:03:47.220> him<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.490> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
they're not really going to be worth

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.780 
they're not really going to be worth
