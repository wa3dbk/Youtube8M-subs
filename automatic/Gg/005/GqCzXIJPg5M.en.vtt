 Jessica knew I drink so little did I once Being 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:58.890
 Did not let me hear 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:03.019
 5 You're not doing it yet. 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.019
 In this way, 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:17.330
 When I try to emphasize the beautiful figure of Mr. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.840
 Up words so forth it is a little different. What uh-General just outside the terms 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.840
 Save 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:34.009
 I am really grateful to you, but I'm too pretty new style 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 Even if I wear it, I eat a little bit of food . 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.619

 For us to think in the future I'll have you're on this sseulkkayo 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:49.940
 Tribute also end 4 Oh yeah look no SiO When we learned last week 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:52.069
 The staff has a long history, but the two white stools are older. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.929
 I do not think we'll be caught. 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:03.590
 In the form of a handsome shirt It's been about a million one thousand years Would period of about 50 years 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:09.229
 I found this shirt is that in ancient Youtube What then is the collar and buttons 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:14.000
 Eopeotjyo something like this of course I do. But the closure of its salts written upside down in seconds 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:19.670
 It was used as a men's underwear for a while until the late 18th century. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.830
 So, nowadays, in Europe, a man takes a dress shirt and takes off his jacket . 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:30.739
 Just wearing a little underwear is like standing in the same force. 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:34.519
 2 To tell a white shirt, a white shirt is actually a donation at the time. 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:39.890
 Was a symbol of power and control Yeah Well Now Think about it 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:44.480
 I have a washing machine , and Tribe is right across a house. 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.430
 But then it says to the laundry itself've really quick hello 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 It is a huge labor force and effort so you can wash your servants 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.900
 Only those with wealth of the extent to which it is That That's also when some dragged 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.800
 I have it 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:03.099
 It's a white color blue. So you're even doing a worker. 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.099
 I had to separate it hadeoraguyo divide the work in that sense
