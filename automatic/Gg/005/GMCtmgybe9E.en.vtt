00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.790
 video of June 12 points like because 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.589
 that these are important topics and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 sensitive because that often puts back 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.679
 in question certainties deep and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 because finally the real goal is not 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.830
 to impose his opinion but to bring the other 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
 to think for ourselves we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 are told that a few tips from 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.660
 gardening could be useful for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 gate planters firstly do not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 leave without argument despite the envied 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.220
 legitimate to save the world 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.080
 these topics are too important for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 to be treated lightly if you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 tackle submunitions you risk to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.090
 quickly lose your interlocutor who 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 leaving you will leave a very label 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 adhesive 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.809
 secondly do not start a topic 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.370
 between pear and cheese 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.380
 these topics are too important for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 to be treated in two minutes it requires 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.590
 to be argued better leave 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.239
 spend an opportunity that we know too much 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 short rather than not having the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.660
 time to argue his words the most 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.440
 often a poorly planted valve will not grow 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.870
 no or bad 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 thirdly the new experience that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 for oneself to avoid announcing 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 conclusions of your weeks month years 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.199
 research 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 in a peremptory phrase kind of paved 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 in the pond who are asking you in 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 holder of the absolute truth about 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 your poor ignorant interlocutor I do not 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 do not say that this is the case I say 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 that it is quite possible that he will not take 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
 like that if that's the case you risk 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 strong to point the person and break 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.409
 the discussion the goal is not so 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 to spread out his science but planted the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.350
 seed of doubt 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 Fourth, support your words 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 do you rely on the credibility of others 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 recognized persons 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.009
 and hardly attackable imagine a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.810
 bridge or a line that must 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 to build there without awakening as 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
 as a result without reliable support and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 understandable your argument does not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.039
 holds that on the credibility that you 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.399
 give your interlocutor the subject 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.350
 addressed 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.270
 the problem is that many areas 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.070
 are bound by the same problem of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 profitability and aridity so it's 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 current to make reconciliations 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 between finance politics 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 and yesterday for example gold no one can 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 to be an expert in economics 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.539
 politics science journalist 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.579
 neurological and so it is 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.500
 credible everywhere at once this even though 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 advanced thesis tina double route 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 obligation in the first instance of good 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.869
 to get informed so that you can then ask 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 source milestones and its arguments in 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 advancing in his fifth presentation 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.729
 avoid labels 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 that's a difficult thing 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.209
 impossible family and friends you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.130
 having already labeled everything from 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.140
 take into account what is written on 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.729
 this list labels the comic boyfriend 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.539
 with whom it is impossible to have a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.940
 serious discussion 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.590
 the insolent young label usually 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.180
 stuck by older people or 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 who consider themselves to be of higher status 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.660
 the old embittered label usually 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 stuck by younger people 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.110
 the paranoid alarmist constantly panicked 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.770
 do we see evil everywhere and speaking with 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.770
 a soundtrack of bells 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.510
 Yes 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 1 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.800
 aah 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.650
 know the label that our 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.270
 interlocutor stuck us is very 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.330
 useful if not essential to establish 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.070
 a constructive discussion avoiding 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.690
 the topics on which you are listed 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.270
 or by approaching them in a more 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.700
 progressive aikido thinking when one 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.030
 is in the territory express myself thinking 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.830
 unique 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.840
 the argument of the red pill subjects 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.340
 can quickly be comparable to a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.750
 fighting port rather than you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.000
 engage in a boxing bout of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.920
 sewer I'm right you're wrong fight 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.940
 frontal is very often sterile which does not 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.010
 do not advance the schmilblick 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.690
 focus on the goal bring your 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.640
 interlocutor to think honestly 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.470
 on your arguments then inspire you to 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.910
 aikido just like judo this art 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.440
 martial is using the strength of 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.640
 the adversary 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.930
 explanations of your research there 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.610
 is likely you knew more 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.440
 of things on the subject you are addressing 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.720
 that your opponent and he also thinks 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.520
 know and if on your side you do 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.570
 to initiate and maintain a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.160
 constructive discussion 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.750
 it is possible that in front we want 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.820
 impose a point of view to force you 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.860
 the search will serve you because you 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.690
 already know what pseudo argument ideas 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.190
 received will be opposed to you and you will 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.780
 already the answers are so proof 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.640
 a little bit of patience and 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 let your interlocutor weave his 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.010
 own trap or already knew where to place 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.989
 the charges 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.760
 attention the martial arts also imposes 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.840
 a respect for the adversary we do not 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.140
 do not make fun of him when you mark a 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.270
 point 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.160
 the goal is to progress so in the 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 present case now 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.830
 a constructive discussion this 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.780
 restraint is difficult but necessary 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.610
 to cold analyze the facts 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.230
 the outburst of anger poses us 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.270
 blinders and nobody would have the idea of 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.920
 to make a puzzle to x 1000 pieces with 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.180
 blinkers for a simple puzzle we get 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.340
 realized that a panoramic vision 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.470
 is essential why so much 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.750
 small oratory precautions 1 for 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.400
 avoid criticism dominated but kezako 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.720
 this is the favorite weapon of 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.400
 people who do not want to face a 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.140
 such critical argument the one he 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.520
 states process is wide but 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.050
 unfortunately effective you are not 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 economist so you do not know anything 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.780
 rethink that sentence of gandhi 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.940
 first they ignore you 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.740
 then he rails you then they will you 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.780
 fight and finally organic 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.000
 the criticism to dominate and therefore the phase 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.370
 to ridicule demonize for 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.230
 discredit little b to avoid the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.970
 dot godwin symbolic moment where the 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.560
 discussion becomes impossible because your 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.139
 interlocutor by a heap of pseudo 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.789
 arguments of bad faith 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.050
 the receipts chained and often pulled by 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.729
 the hair explains to you that your 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 position is comparable to that of 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.779
 Nazis so indefensible implied 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.270
 bend the saplings and go back often you 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.979
 flogging and finally it's small because 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.289
 that a seed does not grow by pulling 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.550
 it must be watered neither too much nor too much 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.990
 little and let it sprout 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.029
 the key is to maintain the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.990
 discussion so keep it in mind the 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.180
 some points announced here 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.740
 last point remember that what 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.969
 we say little destabilized power 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.419
 totally upset the life of a 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.099
 nobody 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.659
 from there we could honestly 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.490
 ask the question of is it for example 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.960
 really worth stressing or painting and 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.129
 your grandmother with a reality 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.810
 that she will not have time to change 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.219
 she who may have lived years 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.750
 hard thinks probably 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.189
 that today all this is over for 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.319
 his grandchildren and bathes in a 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.550
 sweet blue pill served to point with a 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.629
 sprig of parsley every day at the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.789
 high mass of the line and 20 hours 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.620
 there is no single answer and that's 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.150
 everyone to judge before closing this 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.800
 video we wanted to sent you a 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.430
 thank you very much for your support and your

 thanks to you we are now at 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.620

 on the site 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.129
 a constantly growing number and 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.080
 which is not limited to that I have a doubt 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.770
 take the time to go fast do 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.689
 things well 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.669
 avoiding that history repeats itself a 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.439
 umpteenth time the world is about to 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.689
 change we only have the choice of 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.639
 do not suffer or be the protagonists 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.520
 thank you for your attention and see you soon 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.419
 for a new

 the two giants doubt dot com
