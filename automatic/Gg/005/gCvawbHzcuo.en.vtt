remember<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> NSA<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> money<00:01:58.200> spending

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
remember that NSA is a money spending

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
remember that NSA is a money spending
machine<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.060> does<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.600> provide<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
machine and it also does not provide a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
machine and it also does not provide a
return<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.860> investment<00:02:02.750> secrecy<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
return on investment secrecy is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.920 
return on investment secrecy is
essentially<00:02:04.500> toxic<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> French

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
essentially toxic and I think the French

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.369 
essentially toxic and I think the French
also<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.420> consider<00:02:10.080> here

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
also have something to to consider here

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.830 
also have something to to consider here
uh<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.970> world<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.450> moving<00:02:12.690> toward<00:02:13.140> opens

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
uh the world is moving toward opens

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.559 
uh the world is moving toward opens
course<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.069> people<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.879> can<00:02:16.239> share

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
course the more people that can share

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.360 
course the more people that can share
information<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.440> talk<00:02:17.709> about<00:02:18.010> information

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
information and talk about information

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.729 
information and talk about information
the<00:02:19.300> faster<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.050> get<00:02:20.260> too<00:02:20.470> creative

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the faster you get too creative

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.910 
the faster you get too creative
solutions<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.660> think<00:02:23.110> Europe<00:02:23.470> needs<00:02:23.650> to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
solutions I think Europe needs to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
solutions I think Europe needs to
understand<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.760> United<00:02:25.120> States<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.569> not

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
understand that the United States is not

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.259 
understand that the United States is not
its<00:02:26.050> friend<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.590> Europe<00:02:27.370> needs<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.910> think

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
its friend and Europe needs to think

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.140 
its friend and Europe needs to think
seriously<00:02:28.569> about<00:02:29.019> removing<00:02:29.950> us<00:02:30.129> faces<00:02:30.819> from

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
seriously about removing us faces from

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150 
seriously about removing us faces from
Europe<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:32.170> needs<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.920> seriously

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
Europe and it needs to think seriously

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.550 
Europe and it needs to think seriously
about<00:02:33.549> creating<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.360> European<00:02:34.959> intelligence

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
about creating a European intelligence

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.830 
about creating a European intelligence
community<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.819> able<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.480> devise

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
community that is able to devise

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800 
community that is able to devise
strategy<00:02:38.620> policy<00:02:39.540> acquisition<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
strategy policy acquisition and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.520 
strategy policy acquisition and
operations<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.920> public<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.360> open<00:02:43.750> what

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
operations in public in the open what

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.900 
operations in public in the open what
sort<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:44.799> fallout<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> think<00:02:45.610> we'll<00:02:45.760> get

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
sort of fallout do you think we'll get

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.460 
sort of fallout do you think we'll get
then<00:02:46.120> from<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.569> how<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:47.079> Paris

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
then from this how do you think Paris

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.729 
then from this how do you think Paris
might<00:02:47.680> react<00:02:48.480> by<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> large<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:50.470> very

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
might react by and large with very

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.190 
might react by and large with very
little<00:02:50.950> fallout<00:02:51.340> because<00:02:51.760> Paris<00:02:52.480> does<00:02:52.750> secret

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
little fallout because Paris does secret

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.199 
little fallout because Paris does secret
operations<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.130> French<00:02:54.489> steal<00:02:54.819> from<00:02:55.060> the

operations in the French steal from the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.360 
operations in the French steal from the
United<00:02:55.569> States<00:02:55.810> there's<00:02:56.590> an<00:02:56.709> excellent<00:02:57.190> book

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
United States there's an excellent book

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.300 
United States there's an excellent book
called<00:02:57.670> friendly<00:02:58.209> spies<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.890> talks<00:03:00.160> about

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
called friendly spies that talks about

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.240 
called friendly spies that talks about
how<00:03:00.700> Germany<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.510> France<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:02.739> much<00:03:03.010> more

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
how Germany and France do much more

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.979 
how Germany and France do much more
industrial<00:03:03.879> espionage<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.660> United

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
industrial espionage in the United

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.680 
industrial espionage in the United
States<00:03:05.019> than<00:03:05.530> China<00:03:05.799> does<00:03:06.099> oh<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.660> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
States than China does oh so this is a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.930 
States than China does oh so this is a
two-way<00:03:08.140> street<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.340> think<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
two-way street and I think for the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.900 
two-way street and I think for the
viewer<00:03:10.709> what<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.860> really<00:03:12.099> want<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.489> consider

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
viewer what you really want to consider

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.240 
viewer what you really want to consider
here<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.299> not<00:03:13.480> necessarily<00:03:14.079> that<00:03:14.470> NSA<00:03:15.010> is

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
here is not necessarily that NSA is

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.740 
here is not necessarily that NSA is
doing<00:03:15.280> something<00:03:15.790> outrageous<00:03:16.390> against

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
doing something outrageous against

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.590 
doing something outrageous against
France<00:03:17.069> but<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.130> whole<00:03:18.430> issue<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.000> secrecy

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
France but the whole issue of secrecy

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.740 
France but the whole issue of secrecy
versus<00:03:20.139> open<00:03:20.500> source<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:21.150> believe<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.180> we're

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
versus open source I believe that we're

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.160 
versus open source I believe that we're
at<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> end<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> industrial<00:03:24.100> era<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.639> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
at the end of the industrial era of the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.870 
at the end of the industrial era of the
technological<00:03:26.170> paradigm<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.920> think<00:03:27.549> we<00:03:27.700> need

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
technological paradigm I think we need

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.819 
technological paradigm I think we need
to<00:03:28.090> seriously<00:03:28.389> consider<00:03:28.810> shutting<00:03:29.470> down

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
to seriously consider shutting down

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.509 
to seriously consider shutting down
secret<00:03:30.340> intelligence<00:03:30.609> agencies<00:03:31.510> and

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
secret intelligence agencies and

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.770 
secret intelligence agencies and
reviving<00:03:33.519> something<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.120> we<00:03:34.239> haven't<00:03:34.450> done

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
reviving something that we haven't done

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.599 
reviving something that we haven't done
for<00:03:34.810> centuries<00:03:35.230> which<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.889> having<00:03:36.099> open

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
for centuries which is having open

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.670 
for centuries which is having open
discussions<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:37.750> all<00:03:37.989> facts<00:03:38.319> on<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> table

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
discussions with all facts on the table

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.740 
discussions with all facts on the table
do<00:03:39.639> you<00:03:39.730> think<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.090> French<00:03:40.329> leaders

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
do you think that the French leaders

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.900 
do you think that the French leaders
were<00:03:40.989> probably<00:03:41.260> aware<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:42.069> these<00:03:42.280> NSA

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
were probably aware of these NSA

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.809 
were probably aware of these NSA
activities<00:03:43.650> almost<00:03:44.650> certainly<00:03:45.069> they're<00:03:45.579> not

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
activities almost certainly they're not

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.960 
activities almost certainly they're not
naive<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.769> asked<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.609> question<00:03:48.730> because

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
naive so I asked that question because

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.400 
naive so I asked that question because
when<00:03:49.209> angler<00:03:49.419> Merkel's<00:03:49.810> phone<00:03:49.870> was<00:03:50.200> tapped

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
when angler Merkel's phone was tapped

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.930 
when angler Merkel's phone was tapped
she<00:03:50.650> came<00:03:50.829> out<00:03:50.980> initially<00:03:51.400> said<00:03:51.549> oh<00:03:51.579> goodness

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
she came out initially said oh goodness

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.759 
she came out initially said oh goodness
me<00:03:52.030> I'm<00:03:52.299> shocked<00:03:52.630> by<00:03:52.840> all<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.410> then<00:03:53.739> a

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
me I'm shocked by all this and then a

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.349 
me I'm shocked by all this and then a
bit<00:03:53.950> later<00:03:53.980> on<00:03:54.280> she<00:03:54.579> said<00:03:54.730> well<00:03:54.910> yes<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.209> did

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
bit later on she said well yes I did

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.180
