00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
straightforward so do that and here's a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.889 
straightforward so do that and here's a
little<00:01:00.239> twist<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
little twist to it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
little twist to it
wait<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.800> doing<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> toe<00:01:02.280> drag

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
wait when you're doing the toe drag

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
wait when you're doing the toe drag
position<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.270> left<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> left

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
position you want to go left on the left

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
position you want to go left on the left
stick<00:01:04.470> during<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> entire<00:01:05.640> sequence<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
stick during the entire sequence so you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
stick during the entire sequence so you
want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:07.409> doing<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> toe

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
want to be when you're doing the toe

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
want to be when you're doing the toe
drag<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.400> also<00:01:08.580> want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.119> left<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
drag you also want to be going left on

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
drag you also want to be going left on
the<00:01:09.659> left<00:01:09.900> stick<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.650> guessing<00:01:11.220> 9<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the left stick so I'm guessing 9 on the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
the left stick so I'm guessing 9 on the
left<00:01:12.270> stick<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.720> left<00:01:12.930> hand<00:01:13.110> players<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.710> 9

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
left stick for left hand players or 9

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
left stick for left hand players or 9
o'clock<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.350> think<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> left<00:01:16.979> stick

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
o'clock on the think it's the left stick

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
o'clock on the think it's the left stick
for<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> ps3<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.299> well<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.720> keep

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
for the ps3 as well but just keep

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
for the ps3 as well but just keep
practicing<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.430> straightforward

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
practicing not really straightforward

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
practicing not really straightforward
but<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.509> sure<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.780> keep<00:01:22.110> doing<00:01:22.409> these<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but be sure to keep doing these if not

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
but be sure to keep doing these if not
you<00:01:23.189> will<00:01:23.310> screw<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> deke<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you will screw up the deke on to the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
you will screw up the deke on to the
next<00:01:25.140> part<00:01:25.350> alright<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.400> once<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.759> that

and hold lb and the right stick down at

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.820 
and hold lb and the right stick down at
the<00:02:27.610> same<00:02:27.819> time<00:02:28.060> while<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.629> going<00:02:28.900> let<00:02:29.650> go

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the same time while like going let go

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.860 
the same time while like going let go
the<00:02:29.980> toe<00:02:30.129> drag<00:02:30.430> which<00:02:30.670> leads<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.569> deke

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the toe drag which leads to that deke

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.130 
the toe drag which leads to that deke
right<00:02:32.080> there<00:02:32.319> which<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:33.330> unsuccessful<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.599> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
right there which is unsuccessful and it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.539 
right there which is unsuccessful and it
turns<00:02:35.319> out<00:02:35.470> sloppy<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.040> you'll<00:02:36.160> probably<00:02:36.310> get

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
turns out sloppy and you'll probably get

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.420 
turns out sloppy and you'll probably get
decked<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.780> that's<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.799> common<00:02:39.099> error<00:02:39.280> right

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
decked so that's a common error right

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.820 
decked so that's a common error right
there<00:02:39.629> other<00:02:40.629> ones<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.959> can't<00:02:41.290> really<00:02:41.440> think<00:02:41.620> of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
there other ones I can't really think of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.610 
there other ones I can't really think of
are<00:02:42.129> I'm<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.209> basically<00:02:43.780> like<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.500> think

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
are I'm just basically like that I think

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.110 
are I'm just basically like that I think
that's<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.860> only<00:02:44.950> one<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.400> probably<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:45.880> on

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that's the only one you probably get on

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.979 
that's the only one you probably get on
I

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
I

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.589 
I
I<00:02:47.290> guess<00:02:47.650> mixed<00:02:48.069> up<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.400> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> let<00:02:49.360> go<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
I guess mixed up with if you let go of

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.150 
I guess mixed up with if you let go of
the<00:02:49.690> toe<00:02:49.870> drag<00:02:50.110> position<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.739> will<00:02:50.920> happen

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
the toe drag position that will happen

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.729 
the toe drag position that will happen
like<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.970> said<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.599> just<00:02:53.079> keep<00:02:53.230> practicing

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
like I said but just keep practicing

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.530 
like I said but just keep practicing
guys<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.130> really<00:02:54.549> straightforward<00:02:54.849> but

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
guys it's really straightforward but

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.690 
guys it's really straightforward but
like<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.810> said<00:02:55.870> all<00:02:56.290> instructions<00:02:56.980> will<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.220> on

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
like I said all instructions will be on

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.490 
like I said all instructions will be on
the<00:02:57.849> screen<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.690> description<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the screen and in the description and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.250 
the screen and in the description and
now<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.849> right<00:03:01.030> hand<00:03:01.060> players<00:03:01.510> all

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.990 
now on to the right hand players all
right<00:03:02.620> now<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.099> right<00:03:03.280> hand<00:03:03.519> players<00:03:03.790> I'm

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
right now for the right hand players I'm

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.970 
right now for the right hand players I'm
not<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.480> great<00:03:04.629> with<00:03:04.720> righties<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.860> guys

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
not that great with righties you guys

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.369 
not that great with righties you guys
obviously<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.579> that<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.970> hope<00:03:07.390> at<00:03:07.569> least<00:03:07.810> but

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
obviously know that I hope at least but

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.530 
obviously know that I hope at least but
I'll<00:03:08.680> try<00:03:08.950> my<00:03:09.099> best<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.370> replicate<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.060> if<00:03:10.180> not

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
I'll try my best to replicate it if not

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.630 
I'll try my best to replicate it if not
I<00:03:10.870> definitely<00:03:11.019> have<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> put<00:03:11.829> instructions<00:03:12.430> in

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
I definitely have to put instructions in

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.720 
I definitely have to put instructions in
the<00:03:12.730> description<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.569> on-screen<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.860> once

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
the description and on-screen so once

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.340 
the description and on-screen so once
again<00:03:15.849> it's<00:03:16.150> basically<00:03:16.450> mirror<00:03:16.750> image<00:03:17.109> so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
again it's basically mirror image so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.390 
again it's basically mirror image so
what<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.620> want<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.829> do<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.130> want<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> do<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
what you want to do is you want to do a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.910 
what you want to do is you want to do a
toe<00:03:18.670> drag<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.569> it's<00:03:20.049> just<00:03:20.200> mirror<00:03:20.470> image<00:03:20.709> like

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
toe drag but it's just mirror image like

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.319 
toe drag but it's just mirror image like
I<00:03:21.010> said<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.549> right<00:03:21.790> sticky<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.209> goes

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
I said so on the right sticky one goes

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.569 
I said so on the right sticky one goes
from<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.720> 3<00:03:22.930> o'clock<00:03:23.170> position<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> 5

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
from the 3 o'clock position to the 5

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.920 
from the 3 o'clock position to the 5
o'clock<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.150> that's<00:03:25.389> how<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.569> perform<00:03:25.660> your

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
o'clock and that's how you perform your

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.410 
o'clock and that's how you perform your
toe<00:03:26.139> drag<00:03:26.410> while<00:03:26.980> going<00:03:27.280> right<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> left

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
toe drag while going right on the left

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.729 
toe drag while going right on the left

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
stick this time so you got to be doing

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.770 
stick this time so you got to be doing
both<00:03:30.400> these<00:03:30.670> at<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.940> same<00:03:31.180> time<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.599> keep
