00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 to me because today I wanted to talk to you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 about pants because I received 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 enough calls about how the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 I use what kind of pants are the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.750
 suitable for casual wear what are 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
 formal and good let's start with the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 formal pants definitely the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.109
 formality of the pants will mark 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.900
 the fabric the fabric there is from light wool 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.480
 which are like very thin casimires that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 those are the ones that are going to say 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 be the pants that come against that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 only dresses against not wearing the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 trousers of the suit to be combined with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.850
 other blazers or with other shirts is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 discarded because in the long run if you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 wear the suit pants with other 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.870
 things will have many more washed or 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 gone to the dry cleaners and then the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 colors are no longer going to be the same 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.309
 that the pants of the suit goes only 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.739
 with the suit and what is the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 different fabrics there is no texture 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 there are different types of hairlines that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.760
 be classic those are obviously 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.810
 more formal and the pants that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 they come cased 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 with Valencian for example guys if 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 you are short leg or are very 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.539
 short pants avoid pants with 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 Valencian because the wider the 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.890
 valenciana valenciana is the fold that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.750
 we bring in the part of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.159
 pant leg and that is like a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.789
 fold that goes outward to that you'll 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.909
 Valencian flame that will always cut 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.979
 visually what is the leg for another 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.140
 part the denim jeans that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 believe the denim pants are not 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 considered for the world of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.110
 business the jeans are 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.700
 they were made previously for the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.569
 work and good today are that they are 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 really thought for activities not 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.819
 formal do not business anything you have to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.670
 to see with formality is never going to 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.280
 convey seriousness pants 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.349
 jean so if you want 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.049
 convey a good formal image 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.060
 do not wear it this kind of pants 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 dockers pants that good many 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.709
 people like that know it by the brand that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.459
 he made them known but in reality 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.110
 internationally they are known as 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.940
 Chinese pants 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 when we talk about Chinese it does not mean 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.650
 that are Chinese and do not mean that 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 it really is that kind of cut of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.870
 pants that are like the persimmons that are 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.730
 shrink cotton gabardine and that you 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.590
 know many people say ah ok the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750
 type dockers instead of instead of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.460
 Chinese but if you mention Chinese 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.230
 anywhere in the world that is the 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.390
 type of pants where they will locate it and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 they're going to give that kind of pants that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.070
 it's like semi formal it's not so formal 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.110
 like the light wool one neither nor so 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.350
 informal like that of denim then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.600
 here in Mexico, it's like the semi 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.370
 formal or that is the middle ground between 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.410
 the formal and the non-formal the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.180
 denim is definitely not for 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.080
 Business is for all engaged 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.780
 to fashion television to everything that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.880
 is m makeup artists or is all that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.820
 have to do with non-formality not 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.680
 seriously this is perfect pants 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.450
 from denim to where they have to get 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.100
 pants pants must 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.200
 get where the heel of the shoe starts 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.870
 that must measure more or less two 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.599
 centimeters maximum two and a half 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.069
 and this is where the 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.409
 formal must make a break for 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.120
 the front in the shoe part 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.209
 covering perfectly the entire shore 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.370
 of the shoe there are some that are good 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.470
 suddenly in trend that come in your 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.659
 habits and they come as very tight and 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.209
 tell them how to bring puddles good not 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.190
 we are used to in london is very 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.140
 common to see them in executives here not 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.709
 we are used to seeing it and then 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.150
 the short person here the Mexicans 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.519
 they are not of such tall stature and then with 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.980
 the shoe is more noticeable then what 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.840
 segment so my recommendation is that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.209
 drive on the same line if you wish 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.980
 look so much more stylized by 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.540
 last Bermuda shorts because the Bermuda shorts 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
 they definitely lack good taste 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.609
 you will never look well dressed if you 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.560
 Bermudas with the exception that 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.359
 have an invitation to a deck one 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.940
 Pool is on the beach and please if 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:13.990
 is on the beach so avoid using the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.200
 Bermuda with sock and flip flops 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.989
 so well let's continue giving them 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.550
 advice and giving solutions to all 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.680
 your questions answer to all your 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.750
 questions so do not leave because what 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.010
 I invite you to continue your best image 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.010
