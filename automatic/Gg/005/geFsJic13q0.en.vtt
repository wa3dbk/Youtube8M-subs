00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.840
 link to the description of all the good time 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 days ladies and gentlemen with you fishing line this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 today's video is dedicated to us 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 This is really unique items 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.529
 one-handed sword nagash rand which drop 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.010
 etsa only since the last boss goodness balloon 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.680
 And the chance to knock out this item 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.449
 unreal small this item gives 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 really phenomenal bonuses 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.540
 however there is a serious limitation you are not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 You can take this sword is not in the main 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 hand as you see only allows 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.610
 as the main weapon 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.500
 Well, the main bonus of this ball is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 Of course the ability to stretch 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.539
 mass dumbness to all enemies who 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 located 20 meters in front of the owner 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.739
 ball well let's go now 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.460
 Let's test this bonus on this one. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.780
 Now guys, I think he did not die Well 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 look worthy voila here's an animator 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.530
 well, that is, everything is very real here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.549
 just like that and naturally they didn't dangle and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 just 2 seconds but again this is massive 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.470
 skill twenty meters ahead 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.049
 I personally prefer this weapon 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 use on switch understand because 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.840
 what to take it as a basis after all to lose in 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.869
 home indecent amount of damage not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 it would be desirable but just like switch on 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.390
 Arink as a candle in a mini pvp catch 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.979
 quickly pull all over 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 massive silenced of course interesting 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.299
 what can he really say 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 could choose this sword because 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.689
 there is even better laxative light 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 katrina wears a certain kind i don't 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.350
 I will say that there are four hundred of them here. 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.509
 fifty eight percent off power 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 casting ability is basically damazhit 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 some really outfits from 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.729
 this extra bonus they too 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.619
 seemingly created for dual there 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.159
 imagine the magician who takes here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.200
 data of which is old 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.479
 cool in his main hands 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.640
 there i don't know library top it 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.239
 year he gets a hundred more power 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.799
 spells plus 18 percent damage yes 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.170
 also 20 meters 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.510
 salon with a massive it would be 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.310
 really super option provided 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.830
 that this sword falls very rarely I 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.590
 I think it would be quite logical well 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 Perhaps in any updates Koreans then 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.549
 somehow somehow correct and calculate what 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.700
 this sword can be brothers not in 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.379
 main hand in this situation of course 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 if he would have flowed, I would gladly 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.940
 I took emilie nick but at the moment I 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.440
 I use it in the arena purely for a candle 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.190
 option that is, if I see the opportunity 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.989
 try to throw fat on the enemy 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.879
 can be used at least up to 2 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.510
 This second embodiment kopek well in 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.519
 first you can do it blindly 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 that is, here are even seconds and then 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.829
 enough to win some 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.859
 advantage of the enemy may be confused 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.810
 and at this moment you will inflict damage 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.940
 Well, dear friends, our video 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.660
 came to the end thanks to this 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.269
 series 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.609
 whole videos about such here for each 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.829

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.500
 of course, learn new information I 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.840
 I think I have my support but in 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.599
 we will probably do sometime soon 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.109
 review on this ancient squeezed frantic 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.780
 rage here is such a dagger with a very 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.310
 an interesting crit chance 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.040
 I really want to see exactly 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.169
