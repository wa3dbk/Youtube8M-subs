00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.219
 stock itv your city your sender 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.410
 They roll over the highways and 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.599
 bring us from a to b 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.390
 but how cheap and good are they 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.999
 Fernbusse really we have to the test 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.159
 our editor Lukas on his first 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.929
 breasts sent for me it should 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.210
 go to berlin next weekend 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.529
 planes around the track are far too expensive for me 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.149
 I chose the bus 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.399
 decided and now look like it 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.390
 with the offered looks offers there 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.850
 it many 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.130
 and it is especially cheap if 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.190
 you strike early but also lastminute 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.150
 kanban and aviators praise him 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.620
 wrap up 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.570
 after a little search I have that 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.790
 suitable offer for me found 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.960
 Flix bus is for me for 24 euros 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.550
 to Berlin 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.000
 that was always a 1 euro cheaper than 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.740
 the rest of the suppliers go with it 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.200
 the ticket in the bag can be the trip 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.360
 for lukas but start at the search 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.290
 after the departure place there are first 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.299
 difficulties so that in the weather 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 the bosom things relatively fast and easy 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.450
 I'm standing here now at the airport 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.490
 finally the right departure place 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.259
 found the problem is there is no 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.179
 Central departure point of all 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.770
 That's why I hope now 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.079
 my bus arrives on time and me 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.210
 in general, I'm correct in terms of 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.880
 punctuality is there for the Fernbus 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.920
 In any case, a plus point he comes 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.380
 on the second exactly at the stop 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 and Lukas does not have to be any longer 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.509
 So, stand outside into the warm and that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.100
 convinced the other passengers in the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.100
 first time with a Fernbus on the way 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.570
 What do you like about it? 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.280
 that is cheaper than for example with 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 the train to drive or fly because 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.120
 It works faster because I do not 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.410
 change and what is cheaper for 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.050
 cheaper than new time also the two 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.670
 bus drivers to pay a visit 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.770
 what do you think are the advantages? 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.390
 definitely had a remote bus 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.130
 is comfortable you have no stress and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.540
 We have a building and I drink 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.370
 see now in the bus behind me is 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.590
 that's always so full of it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.320
 now an exception 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.709
 So the weekend is always 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.540
 full 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.160
 it is becoming more accepted it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 really so that you are so often late 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.880
 comes only if bus take then 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.800
 maybe a traffic jam comes to me 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.330
 the experience is made that now 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.350
 ever more dependent but we are 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.260
 still in the time 120 minutes 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.650
 late hour late in berlin 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.140
 in port comfort the bus drives 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.450
 in the fast lane but with almost nine 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.489
 hour's drive it is from stuttgart 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.130
 Berlin a little world trip 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.630
 And what does Lukas say about his first bus? 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.550
 all in all, can be said 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.010
 that the long-distance buses are a good alternative 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 to train and plane they are 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.310
 cheap you can spontaneously book and you 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.350
 are very comfortable 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.120
 Unfortunately, that would be a disadvantage in Stuttgart 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.350
 the railway stations are far apart and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.239
 are difficult to reach 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.010
 but that does not matter you can see them 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.510
 Buses are well used and we 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.410
 wish all who use the offer 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.410
 a good ride
