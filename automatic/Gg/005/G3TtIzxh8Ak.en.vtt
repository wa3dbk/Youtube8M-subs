farming<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.250> opening<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.849> did<00:00:09.090> see<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> map

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
farming in the opening you did see a map

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.140 
farming in the opening you did see a map
of<00:00:09.870> queensdale<00:00:10.650> that's<00:00:11.040> where<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.370> are<00:00:11.400> we're

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
of queensdale that's where we are we're

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.049 
of queensdale that's where we are we're
in<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> water<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.870> got<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> farm<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:14.130> river

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
in the water we got a farm these river

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
in the water we got a farm these river
Drake's<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.920> massive<00:00:17.310> ones<00:00:17.520> seem<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> get

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
Drake's the massive ones seem to get

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810 
Drake's the massive ones seem to get
more<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.720> also<00:00:18.840> get<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.439> bears<00:00:19.859> but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
more you can also get it from bears but

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
more you can also get it from bears but
i<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> drop<00:00:21.510> ratio<00:00:22.050> might<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.470> higher

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
i think the drop ratio might be higher

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.830 
i think the drop ratio might be higher
on<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.160> drakes<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.289> drinks

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
on the drakes so we're gonna do drinks

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
on the drakes so we're gonna do drinks
but<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:28.050> don't<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:28.859> many<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
but i don't know how many i get in the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.040 
but i don't know how many i get in the
video<00:00:29.730> i<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:30.029> i<00:00:30.090> might<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.420> even<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.810> any

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
video i think i might not even get any

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
video i think i might not even get any
until<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> second<00:00:32.399> portion<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:33.450> there's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
until the second portion because there's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
until the second portion because there's
two<00:00:33.930> parts<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.530> that's<00:00:34.770> why<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> did<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
two parts of this that's why I did the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
two parts of this that's why I did the
maps<00:00:35.690> there's<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.870> areas<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
maps there's two areas where you can

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.940 
maps there's two areas where you can
farm<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.899> area<00:00:40.079> isn't<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.770> good

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
farm them the first area isn't as good

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.920 
farm them the first area isn't as good
because<00:00:41.280> there's<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.850> many<00:00:42.000> second<00:00:42.780> area

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
because there's not as many second area

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.130 
because there's not as many second area
there<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.500> everywhere<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
there are everywhere and you know it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
there are everywhere and you know it's
pretty<00:00:46.260> easy<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.940> remember<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.090> by

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
pretty easy and just remember there by

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
pretty easy and just remember there by
the<00:00:48.390> water<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.899> mean<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.170> seriously<00:00:49.710> all

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the water I mean that's seriously all

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.700 
the water I mean that's seriously all
you<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> water<00:00:51.710> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you got to know there by the water and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.830 
you got to know there by the water and
hence<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> name<00:00:53.760> river<00:00:54.300> Drake<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.840> honestly

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
hence the name river Drake so honestly

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
hence the name river Drake so honestly
AoE<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.850> anything<00:01:00.239> here

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
AoE is not going to do anything here

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
AoE is not going to do anything here
it's<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> count<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.800> that's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's not going to count for that's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.890 
it's not going to count for that's
basically<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:03.120> I'm<00:01:03.239> saying<00:01:04.909> maybe<00:01:05.909> warrior

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
basically what I'm saying maybe warrior

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
basically what I'm saying maybe warrior
might<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.380> better<00:01:07.560> i'm<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.950> sure<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.520> I'm

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
might be better i'm not sure again I'm

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.460 
might be better i'm not sure again I'm
not<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.909> warrior<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.450> necromancer's<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
not a warrior my necromancer's to my a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.550 
not a warrior my necromancer's to my a
we<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.520> takes<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.479> effect<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.350> all

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we kind of like takes an effect but all

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
we kind of like takes an effect but all
I<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.850> aioli<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.840> doing<00:01:16.080> nothing<00:01:17.420> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I know is my aioli was doing nothing but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
I know is my aioli was doing nothing but
my<00:01:18.570> minions<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.080> helping<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.070> had<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.880> up

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
my minions were helping if I had them up

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
my minions were helping if I had them up
so<00:01:21.360> maybe<00:01:22.170> maybe<00:01:22.950> engineers<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.820> good

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so maybe maybe engineers would be good

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
so maybe maybe engineers would be good
for<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.390> their<00:01:24.509> turrets<00:01:24.810> need<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
for this but their turrets need the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.289 
for this but their turrets need the
cooldown<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.979> I'd<00:01:26.280> say<00:01:26.640> warrior<00:01:27.060> would

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
cooldown so I'd say warrior would

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
cooldown so I'd say warrior would
probably<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> best<00:01:28.200> class<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.530> doing

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
probably be the best class for doing

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
probably be the best class for doing
this<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> forming<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.509> honestly<00:01:31.350> all

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this kind of forming now honestly all

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
this kind of forming now honestly all
you<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.640> split<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.000> two

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you you could really just split up two

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
you you could really just split up two
groups<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:34.619> farming

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
groups and do all the other farming

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.510 
groups and do all the other farming
methods<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.479> 22<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> mean<00:01:37.439> pick<00:01:38.070> who's<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> best

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
methods to 22 I mean pick who's the best

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.399 
methods to 22 I mean pick who's the best
class<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> there's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> second<00:01:40.020> area<00:01:40.140> where

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
class and there's the second area where

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.289 
class and there's the second area where
to<00:01:40.500> farm<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> other<00:01:41.490> area<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.970> closed

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
to farm now the other area was closed

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.340 
to farm now the other area was closed
off<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:44.610> hand<00:01:44.850> side<00:01:45.020> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> pause

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
off in the right hand side if you pause

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
off in the right hand side if you pause
the<00:01:46.380> video<00:01:46.619> earlier<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the video earlier you would see that

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
the video earlier you would see that
that<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.600> only<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:51.290> they're<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that was only because they're that
