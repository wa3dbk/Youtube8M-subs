Oh butter Bell crock and this I got for
my<00:00:03.419> wife<00:00:05.660> it's<00:00:06.660> inspired<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.040> is

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
my wife it's inspired or this is

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.570 
my wife it's inspired or this is
apparently<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.880> French<00:00:09.420> people<00:00:10.550> store<00:00:11.550> their

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
apparently how French people store their

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
apparently how French people store their
butter<00:00:13.610> go<00:00:14.610> ahead<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.849> take<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:18.289> made<00:00:19.289> in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
butter go ahead and take it out made in

butter go ahead and take it out made in
China

China
though<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.760> anyway<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.769> works

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
though this one anyway so how it works

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.740 
though this one anyway so how it works
is<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.279> take<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.789> butter<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.640> put<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
is you take your butter and you put it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.189 
is you take your butter and you put it
in<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> cup<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.470> has<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.800> softer<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.840> then

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in that cup it has to be softer and then

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
in that cup it has to be softer and then
you<00:00:31.349> fill<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.219> water<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:33.120> totally

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you fill this with water not totally

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.889 
you fill this with water not totally
full<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> down<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
full and then you put this down on it

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.639 
full and then you put this down on it
and<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> keeps<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.710> butter<00:00:37.920> fresh<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and it keeps your butter fresh so that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
and it keeps your butter fresh so that
it's<00:00:40.950> soft<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.640> fresh<00:00:42.239> here's<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> problem

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it's soft and fresh here's the problem

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.200 
it's soft and fresh here's the problem
that<00:00:43.520> we<00:00:44.520> had<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.390> decided<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.260> even

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
that we had so we decided we don't even

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.040 
that we had so we decided we don't even
want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:50.000> obviously<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> use

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
want to use it obviously if you use

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.100 
want to use it obviously if you use
butter<00:00:52.350> somewhat<00:00:53.100> often<00:00:53.719> for<00:00:54.719> toast<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
butter somewhat often for toast or

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.099 
butter somewhat often for toast or
whatever<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.340> soft<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
whatever you do like it's soft and

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.420 
whatever you do like it's soft and
keeping<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> fridge<00:00:58.500> kind<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> makes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
keeping it in the fridge kind of makes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.529 
keeping it in the fridge kind of makes
it<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> pain<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> pain<00:01:03.120> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it a pain but this is kind of a pain in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.410 
it a pain but this is kind of a pain in
and<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> itself<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:05.040> never<00:01:05.339> had<00:01:05.640> butter<00:01:06.090> go

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and of itself I've never had butter go

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
and of itself I've never had butter go
mouldy<00:01:07.460> until<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
mouldy until we use this you put you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.429 
mouldy until we use this you put you
have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> change<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.090> frequently<00:01:15.439> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
have to change the water frequently so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
have to change the water frequently so
that<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.040> doesn't<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.549> moldy<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.780> just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that as it doesn't go moldy it just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
that as it doesn't go moldy it just
seems<00:01:19.170> kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> counterintuitive<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.430> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
seems kind of counterintuitive like we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.200 
seems kind of counterintuitive like we
usually<00:01:21.420> kept<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:24.750> dish<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.210> we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
usually kept it on a little dish and we

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
usually kept it on a little dish and we
didn't<00:01:27.450> use<00:01:27.479> butter<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.560> often

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
didn't use butter all that often

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.890 
didn't use butter all that often
I<00:01:29.100> suppose<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> use<00:01:30.479> butter<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> time

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
I suppose if you use butter all the time

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.999 
I suppose if you use butter all the time
but<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> time<00:01:34.829> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
but if you use it all the time it's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
but if you use it all the time it's
gonna<00:01:35.130> stay<00:01:35.369> fresh<00:01:35.610> anyway<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.540> seems

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
gonna stay fresh anyway so it just seems

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.649 
gonna stay fresh anyway so it just seems
kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:38.509> superfluous

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
kind of superfluous

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.310 
kind of superfluous
to<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.040> apparently<00:01:41.700> top<00:01:42.000> chefs<00:01:42.390> chefs

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to do this apparently top chefs chefs

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
to do this apparently top chefs chefs
all<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> world<00:01:44.100> use<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:47.000> don't

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
all over the world use this I don't

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
all over the world use this I don't
really<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> purpose<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
really see the purpose so if you if you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.740 
really see the purpose so if you if you
do<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.720> let<00:01:54.720> me

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
do you know what this is good for let me

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959 
do you know what this is good for let me
know<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> suppose<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> dusty

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
know I suppose if you work in a dusty

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.630 
know I suppose if you work in a dusty
environment<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> covered

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
environment you want to keep it covered

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.990 
environment you want to keep it covered
by<00:01:59.969> thawed<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:02.000> cover

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
by thawed but then you just get a cover

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.630 
by thawed but then you just get a cover
for<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.530> butter<00:02:04.530> dish<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> live<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
for your butter dish now if you live in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.360 
for your butter dish now if you live in
a<00:02:05.700> humid<00:02:06.180> climate<00:02:06.420> maybe<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.270> moldy<00:02:09.289> area

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
a humid climate maybe or a moldy area

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.160 
a humid climate maybe or a moldy area
this<00:02:11.370> might<00:02:11.640> protect<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this might protect it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.540 
this might protect it
but<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:13.590> you're<00:02:13.770> introducing<00:02:14.340> water

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
but then you're introducing water

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.830 
but then you're introducing water
directly<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.270> butter<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> dark<00:02:17.840> humid

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
directly to the butter in a dark humid

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.740 
directly to the butter in a dark humid
environment<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:21.209> impressed<00:02:21.569> with

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
environment so I'm not impressed with

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.809 
environment so I'm not impressed with
this<00:02:23.270> basically<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:25.140> solution<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.860> instead<00:02:26.760> of

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
this basically my solution is instead of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.880 
this basically my solution is instead of
thawing<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.450> whole<00:02:27.690> stick<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.290> butter<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.680> don't

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
thawing a whole stick of butter we don't
