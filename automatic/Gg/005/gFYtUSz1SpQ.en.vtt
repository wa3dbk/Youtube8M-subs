could<00:03:07.349> run<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.709> an<00:03:07.889> audit<00:03:08.400> ran<00:03:08.609> cooler<00:03:09.120> by<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
could run you an audit ran cooler by the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.119 
could run you an audit ran cooler by the
way<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:10.049> designed<00:03:10.439> everything<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
way they designed everything in the

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.860 
way they designed everything in the
engine<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.579> engine<00:03:11.609> just<00:03:11.909> automatically<00:03:12.599> ran

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
engine the engine just automatically ran

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.259 
engine the engine just automatically ran
cooler<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.769> when<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:14.430> started<00:03:14.819> trying<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
cooler so when they started trying to

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.970 
cooler so when they started trying to
limit<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.720> amount<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:16.079> area<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.650> into<00:03:16.889> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
limit the amount of area to get into the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.949 
limit the amount of area to get into the

radiator to make the cars run hot who
had<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.169> advantage<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.370> Ford<00:03:20.639> guys<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
had the advantage the Ford guys and the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.839 
had the advantage the Ford guys and the
Chevy<00:03:22.019> dogs<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.620> Toyota<00:03:22.980> guys<00:03:23.129> they've<00:03:23.669> been

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
Chevy dogs and Toyota guys they've been

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.430 
Chevy dogs and Toyota guys they've been
trying<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.329> catch<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:24.780> forward<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
trying to catch up with forward and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.409 
trying to catch up with forward and
figure<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.680> how<00:03:25.769> they<00:03:26.069> could<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.790> know<00:03:26.940> keep

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
figure out how they could you know keep

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.960 
figure out how they could you know keep
your<00:03:27.569> cars<00:03:27.870> running<00:03:28.230> as<00:03:28.349> cool<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.699> they

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
your cars running as cool but and they

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.729 
your cars running as cool but and they
made<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> lot<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.389> games<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.169> I<00:03:31.199> still<00:03:31.470> think

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
made a lot of games but I still think

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.349 
made a lot of games but I still think
that<00:03:31.829> was<00:03:32.129> one<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> big<00:03:32.609> advantages<00:03:32.639> to

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
that was one of the big advantages to

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.509 
that was one of the big advantages to
