then the lower flap at the top you want
to<00:00:33.719> fold<00:00:33.930> straight<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.700> as<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:35.940> showing

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
to fold straight down as we're showing

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:46.220 
to fold straight down as we're showing
here<00:00:43.820> next<00:00:44.820> you'll<00:00:45.059> take<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.539> half<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.989> the

upper flap where you just cut and fold
it<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> side<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.070> this

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:21.460 

now<00:01:05.210> repeat<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.990> other<00:01:06.110> side<00:01:20.470> now

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
now repeat that on the other side now

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.640 
now repeat that on the other side now
we're<00:01:21.620> going<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:21.890> go<00:01:21.980> back<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.400> first<00:01:22.670> flap

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
we're going to go back to the first flap

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.110 
we're going to go back to the first flap
and<00:01:24.650> fold<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.340> back<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.760> other<00:01:25.790> way

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
and fold it back the other way

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:37.510 
and fold it back the other way
like<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:35.650> now<00:01:36.650> repeat<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.160> on<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.400> other

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
like this now repeat that on the other

like this now repeat that on the other
side

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.120 

next<00:01:54.130> we'll<00:01:54.310> fold<00:01:54.549> up<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.969> two<00:01:55.149> bottom<00:01:55.509> flags

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
next we'll fold up the two bottom flags

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.660 
next we'll fold up the two bottom flags
so<00:01:57.130> first<00:01:57.399> on<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.759> left<00:01:57.850> side<00:01:59.429> just<00:02:00.429> fold

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:19.240 
straight up like this now repeat that on
the<00:02:07.840> right<00:02:07.990> side

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.480 

I<00:02:19.310> will<00:02:20.060> fold<00:02:20.240> each<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.630> those<00:02:20.750> pieces<00:02:21.490> down

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
I will fold each of those pieces down

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:39.230 
I will fold each of those pieces down
and<00:02:22.820> out<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.750> this

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:51.400 

now<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> other<00:02:40.200> side

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.020 

I'll<00:02:51.950> flip<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.310> piece<00:02:52.490> over<00:02:57.640> now<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.700> need<00:02:58.910> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I'll flip the piece over now we need to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.190 
I'll flip the piece over now we need to
make<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.360> beard<00:02:59.570> for<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.930> coat<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.870> what

you'll do is grab your scissors and at
the<00:03:06.980> bottom<00:03:07.310> point<00:03:08.110> we're<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.320> make<00:03:09.470> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
the bottom point we're going to make a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:30.550 
the bottom point we're going to make a
series<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.010> thin<00:03:10.460> partial<00:03:11.090> cuts<00:03:11.710> like<00:03:12.710> this

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.110 

and<00:03:31.560> once<00:03:31.769> that's<00:03:32.160> done<00:03:32.430> spread<00:03:32.879> out<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and once that's done spread out the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:48.110 
and once that's done spread out the
pieces<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.660> beard

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.390 

then<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.810> last<00:03:48.989> step<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.470> fold<00:03:49.799> over<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
then the last step is to fold over the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:03.540 
then the last step is to fold over the
top<00:03:50.760> point<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.620> head<00:03:52.799> as<00:03:53.010> we<00:03:53.159> shown<00:03:53.400> here

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550
