or a combination on this so you pull it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
or a combination on this so you pull it
out<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.250> directions<00:00:20.789> so

maintain pressure on the toggle switch

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
maintain pressure on the toggle switch
in<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.680> master<00:00:26.039> lock<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.369> open<00:00:26.430> every<00:00:26.820> time

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
in your master lock will open every time

in your master lock will open every time
there's<00:00:27.779> been<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> lot<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> reviews<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.039> how

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
there's been a lot of reviews on how

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
there's been a lot of reviews on how
this<00:00:29.369> thing's<00:00:29.640> work<00:00:30.000> five<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> seven

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this thing's work five out of seven

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
this thing's work five out of seven
times<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
times but actually if you do it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
times but actually if you do it
correctly<00:00:32.910> it'll<00:00:33.540> open<00:00:33.660> every<00:00:34.649> time<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.010> do

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
correctly it'll open every time you do

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
correctly it'll open every time you do
it<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.969> by<00:00:36.090> maintaining<00:00:36.450> pressure

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it and that is by maintaining pressure

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.000 
it and that is by maintaining pressure
on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> dial

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on the dial

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.240 
on the dial
don't<00:00:38.640> lift<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.270> finger<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.559> when

don't lift your finger off because when

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
don't lift your finger off because when
you<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:42.090> loses<00:00:42.899> track<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you do that it loses track of where you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
you do that it loses track of where you
are<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
are so here it is I'm not to do it so I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.889 
are so here it is I'm not to do it so I
press<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> button<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.570> how<00:00:48.750> I'm

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
press the button and then see how I'm

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
press the button and then see how I'm
lifting<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.289> finger<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.100> won't<00:00:50.940> open

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
lifting my finger off it won't open

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.350 
lifting my finger off it won't open
again<00:00:52.370> maintain<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.550> pressure<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> dial

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

again maintain your pressure on the dial
when<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> open<00:00:55.469> because<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
when you want it to open because if you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
lock a 1500 ID on the back there's a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
lock a 1500 ID on the back there's a
little<00:01:07.830> switch<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.729> covered<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
little switch and it's covered when you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.560 
little switch and it's covered when you
buy<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> label<00:01:10.799> off<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.570> the

buy it so I take the label off of the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.859 
buy it so I take the label off of the
black<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.450> once<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> get

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
black and then what you do once you get

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
black and then what you do once you get
the<00:01:16.020> label<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> pen<00:01:17.490> or

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the label off is you get a pen or

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
the label off is you get a pen or
whatever<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> switch<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.990> switch<00:01:19.140> into

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
whatever and you switch the switch into

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160 
whatever and you switch the switch into
the<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.920> position<00:01:20.420> make<00:01:21.420> sure<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> lock<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the up position make sure the lock is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
the up position make sure the lock is
open<00:01:22.380> though<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.060> switch

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
open though when you do that so switch

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.140 
open though when you do that so switch
it<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.180> then<00:01:27.180> put<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.780> lock<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
it up like so and then put the lock in

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.830 
it up like so and then put the lock in
squeeze<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.360> twice<00:01:30.630> once<00:01:30.960> twice<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.979> open<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
squeeze it twice once twice and open it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
squeeze it twice once twice and open it
and<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> turn<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> over<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and what you do is you turn it over you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
and what you do is you turn it over you
program<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.210> whatever<00:01:36.689> combination<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.380> did

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
program in whatever combination you did

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.370 
program in whatever combination you did
is<00:01:38.369> ittle<00:01:38.640> simple<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:40.170> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
is ittle simple up and down because that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
is ittle simple up and down because that
makes<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> easy<00:01:40.890> keep<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> pressure<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
makes it easy keep the pressure on the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
makes it easy keep the pressure on the
center<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> switch<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> key

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
center of the switch which is the key
