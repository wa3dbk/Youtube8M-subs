00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to everyone here I am 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.720
 not felt and today I'm going to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.049
 show how to crack need for speed 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.360
 undercover 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 so as you know a korver farce 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.490
 is one of the games of the hymn for speed 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.160
 created by electronic art and who is a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.279
 Mission game late in the mission had 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.359
 two missions with races etc 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 so I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.119
 cracker but on the other hand once he 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.680
 be cracked I could not play 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.580
 line 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 unfortunately because seen as 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
 we fall in love with the active and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 so his minions it's ideal for those 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.750
 who have just downloaded game via the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.809
 p2p so a little like me and they 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 want and want to have the game for 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.390
 play alone alone and I 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.100
 just tell you that I put a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.250
 link in the link of a torrent in the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.489
 description of the video so you the the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 mud stream download it via the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.020
 mediafax link being description of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.390
 the video and then the end one of 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 mediafire links and then you start 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 do you have software that use p2p 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 so I use torrent but you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 can use something else so for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.720
 having to be able to crack a force has 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.970
 said for speed undercover was already 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 downloaded the files via the link 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 media via the second link media 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.040
 almost is in interruption of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 video can impress the chargers actually 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 of a guide right you check out if you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.780
 asking passes of critics 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.070
 found in the description of the video so 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 as promised the password is fine 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.950
 in the description of the video it is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.020
 well and the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.550
 nowhere else he is in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700
 description of the video you will be able to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.620
 see and register in here in this art 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 china once you finish from 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.690
 extract a folder named crack 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.180
 nfs undercover paris to forget about 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.280
 now there are three xml files 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.080
 qiagen points ex a which is called nfs 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.570
 points ex and one point paul students 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.979
 so we will leave nfs points ex and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.680
 paul dll two sides we're just going 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.850
 open kaizen points ex for the moment 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 so here you have a small window 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.490
 like that which then appears so already 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.829
 you will start 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.020
 your game you're going to start you go 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.239
 in the folder you put your 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.340
 genevois there and you double click 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 on autorun ex points file so 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.890
 that one you select your language 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.650
 I take English I will do 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 install I'm going to install it 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.769
 if you mark a message you do yes 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.880
 and here they are, they will take the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.380
 first thing that asks you is the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.230
 key is normally you can not 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.260
 to decide your skin well back on the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.400
 quay and jane wanted on generali 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.019
 general end that generates the key you 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.709
 copy a series of 4 the series of 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.569
 four digits 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.819
 you see that there are five sets of 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.680
 four digits you copy each of 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:58.190
 these series one by one and wanted to stick 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:59.720
 like that so why why is he 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.640
 well I prefer rather than at the foot 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.220
 because it's easier and it takes 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.650
 less time than rewriting everything and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.870
 it also avoids mistakes 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.100
 so here you copy you paste 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.609
 until it's over 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.010
 if ever the key is invalid 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.590
 grilled on your rights you go back on 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.380
 this window but you empty all and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.079
 the general obligation to redo you 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.609
 redo another key to the obligations 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.280
 next and you install you see me 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.079
 who accepted my key now I can 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.079
 install the game 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 oops 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.060
 here you can install so I 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.319
 did you want to change the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.800
 installation settings of the game you 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.400
 can do it 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.170
 I'm going to keep normal rate us 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.580
 let's wait I'll wish to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.110
 from facilities it will take a 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.630
 little time so I want to skip this 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.240
 part ah yes and if ever you ask 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 to install direct x so you the 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.560
 do it so it's better for you to 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 pilots for for the pilots of your 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.739
 card sounds she will fix 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.720
 if ever your reconversion too 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.280
 previous you just have to skip the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.280
 part of the directx installation 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.639
 so here is the nation just got 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
 finish so once it's over 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.680
 to uncheck the box installed in the aude 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.120
 but djoko because now linked 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.529
 download manager has turned into 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.979
 origin so that without installing anything you 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:37.379
 uncheck the box and you're done 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.180
 now that we have installed the 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.900
 work is not finished 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:46.319
 so it remained closed the file 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.969
 with which you have installed I go 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.729
 in computer swamps or not this 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.330
 work if you're on a 6 p hike 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:58.020
 we discuss the main program file 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.180
 electronic art non forgiveness cy and game 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.650
 excuse me but for speed undercover 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.669
 you now have you will us 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.479
 let's do a backup of these 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.699
 files in order to restore them 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.349
 in case it does not work already 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.629
 you would rename the nfs file 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:19.560
 ex points indeed this tube two points 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:22.589
 expressing his charge 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.900
 then you do the same thing for the 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.129
 point dll pole you renamed pole 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.189
 two points of the wings 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.379
 it will be the backup like that in which 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.000
 need you delete both files 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:38.279
 indeed sex and paul point students 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.020
 and you will see named by paul and you 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:44.069
 rename nfs files two poles 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.659
 two by one effect it's paul now 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.149
 you will take these two files to 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:55.439
 holidays ac should you go to copy it's 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:56.969
 she I have you would take off and 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.399
 so now so the files are 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.930
 stuck then now it's only used to 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.629
 nothing done to create shortcuts seen 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.419
 that shortcuts this go directly 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.830
 to actually touched this point x and gold the 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.990
 file we have it full effect this point 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.710
 x so you will start the crack 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.289
 automatically 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.310
 now you can reduce or close 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.580
 this folder me I'm going to close 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.310
 you can also close this folder you 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.060
 close the 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:26.100
 which embarrasses and you if ever a 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.120
 message as it appears your ski 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.069
 strassen project and that's how it is 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.509
 plus a tribute to an icon about 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.539
 whites appears i showed you a 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:39.470
 little test of the game to prove you 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.789
 it starts perfectly 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.590
 So here you see the game 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.660
 just started 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.970
 so I went on but everything 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.919
 at first, but I'd like to film 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.810
 it teaches me when I turn on the game 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.699
 you will see it with the 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.789
 graphics performance of open play and 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.130
 that they are very low if I go 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:02.009
 So here then they ask me to train 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.050
 profit then waited first I'll 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.319
 create my 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.590
 I'm going to change the settings that's 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:12.090
 impossible 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.150
 you see that there I can create my 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.220
 account I was called for example if a 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:23.669
 Russian a wine I rather recalled the 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:27.560
 super bowl felt it's better then 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:29.819
 especially if there is a command line of 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.710
 on the windows desktop yes it's 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:34.620
 normal so you do not shower this line 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.050
 of order here you see that the in 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.259
 train to create my game ben my ma 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.259
 safeguard 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.330
 we will wait a little bit and they will 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:50.190
 you will see that we can play 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.810
 I see here quietly for 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.020
 this video I presented to you as 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.849
 ankrake need for speed undercover boss 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.389
 what about this video via the 

00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:58.710
