that<00:00:43.110> I'm<00:00:43.200> building<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> whole<00:00:43.920> exhaust

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that I'm building on the whole exhaust

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.250 
that I'm building on the whole exhaust
system<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> passenger's<00:00:46.050> side

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
system and it's the passenger's side

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
system and it's the passenger's side
flange<00:00:46.770> coming<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> header<00:00:47.550> but

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
flange coming right off the header but

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
flange coming right off the header but
we<00:00:48.030> should<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.270> take<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> rest<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
we should go take a look at the rest of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
we should go take a look at the rest of
let's<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.230> check<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.590> we've<00:00:49.860> already<00:00:50.039> done

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
let's go check it out we've already done

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.410 
let's go check it out we've already done
here<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.579> we've<00:00:50.700> already<00:00:50.879> routed<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
here is we've already routed this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
here is we've already routed this
passenger<00:00:51.870> side<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.649> close<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
passenger side as close as we can to the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
passenger side as close as we can to the
starter<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.300> too<00:00:54.570> close<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
starter but not too close and then we

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
starter but not too close and then we
routed<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> driver's<00:00:56.520> side<00:00:56.670> around<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.420> we

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
routed the driver's side around so we

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.380 
routed the driver's side around so we
can<00:00:57.780> run<00:00:58.109> both<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
can run both of them into this two and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
can run both of them into this two and
one<00:01:00.629> collector<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> do

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
one collector now what we're going to do

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.280 
one collector now what we're going to do
with<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> driver's<00:01:03.239> side<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:04.170> gonna

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
with this driver's side is we're gonna

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
with this driver's side is we're gonna
use<00:01:04.559> flanges<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.510> ahead<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
use flanges that way we can go ahead and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
use flanges that way we can go ahead and
have<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.710> whole<00:01:08.220> system<00:01:08.729> removable<00:01:09.540> from

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
have this whole system removable from

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.730 
have this whole system removable from
this<00:01:09.990> point<00:01:10.350> back

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this point back

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
this point back
now<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.670> were<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.240> might<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.570> well

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
now when were in here we might as well

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.050 
now when were in here we might as well
go<00:01:13.080> ahead<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.530> mark<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> o2<00:01:14.400> sensor

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
go ahead and mark for the o2 sensor

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.749 
go ahead and mark for the o2 sensor

we're<00:01:46.310> working<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:46.880> custom<00:01:47.270> exhaust<00:01:47.360> for

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
we're working on that custom exhaust for

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.150 
we're working on that custom exhaust for
the<00:01:47.930> ROC<00:01:48.140> buggy<00:01:48.350> right<00:01:48.620> there<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.890> Jesse<00:01:49.130> I

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
the ROC buggy right there and Jesse I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.900 
the ROC buggy right there and Jesse I
think<00:01:49.190> you've<00:01:49.430> got<00:01:49.550> everything<00:01:49.730> under

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
think you've got everything under

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.910 
think you've got everything under
control<00:01:50.030> emotion<00:01:50.660> yes<00:01:50.900> we<00:01:51.290> got<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.560> bomb<00:01:51.710> are

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
control emotion yes we got the bomb are

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
control emotion yes we got the bomb are
you<00:01:54.920> ready<00:01:55.100> for<00:01:55.220> this<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.790> are<00:01:56.030> all<00:01:56.630> right

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
you ready for this we are all right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.420 
you ready for this we are all right
two-in-one<00:01:57.320> collector<00:01:57.950> right<00:01:58.070> here<00:01:58.250> there's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
two-in-one collector right here there's

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.830 
two-in-one collector right here there's
a<00:01:58.490> lot<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.730> advantages<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.480> too<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.780> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
a lot of advantages to this too and the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.300 
a lot of advantages to this too and the
one<00:01:59.930> collector<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:00.410> Meg's<00:02:00.650> because<00:02:01.010> it's<00:02:01.160> not

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
one collector for Meg's because it's not

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.280 
one collector for Meg's because it's not
a<00:02:01.340> swedge<00:02:01.700> collector<00:02:02.270> now<00:02:02.690> what<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.990> means

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
a swedge collector now what that means

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.200 
a swedge collector now what that means
when<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.650> say<00:02:03.800> it's<00:02:03.950> wedged<00:02:04.190> collector<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.700> take

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
when I say it's wedged collector is take

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.820 
when I say it's wedged collector is take
a<00:02:05.240> look<00:02:05.480> at<00:02:05.540> this<00:02:05.690> let's<00:02:05.960> say<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.440> when<00:02:06.740> this

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
a look at this let's say that when this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.200 
a look at this let's say that when this
collector<00:02:07.160> was<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> baby<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.820> started<00:02:08.090> out

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
collector was a baby and it started out

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.850 
collector was a baby and it started out
it's<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.630> piece<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:09.020> tube<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.530> like<00:02:09.679> this

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
it's just a piece of tube just like this

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.800 
it's just a piece of tube just like this
right<00:02:10.100> just<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.460> little<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:11.270> when<00:02:11.720> they

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
right just a little now when they

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.270 
right just a little now when they
stretch<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.500> end<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.890> make<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.160> look

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
stretch out at the end to make it look

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.700 
stretch out at the end to make it look
like<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:13.730> well<00:02:14.360> Jam<00:02:14.600> two<00:02:14.810> rods<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.530> and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
like this well Jam two rods in there and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.470 
like this well Jam two rods in there and
spread<00:02:16.040> them<00:02:16.310> out<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.580> basically<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.270> kind

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
spread them out and basically they kind

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.210 
spread them out and basically they kind
of<00:02:17.540> they<00:02:17.959> kind<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.230> thin<00:02:18.560> out<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.860> metal<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
of they kind of thin out that metal a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.260 
of they kind of thin out that metal a
little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.730> got<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> couple<00:02:20.120> different

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
little bit so you got a couple different

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.090 
little bit so you got a couple different
issues<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:21.050> one<00:02:21.380> you're<00:02:21.800> gonna<00:02:21.890> lose

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
issues going on one you're gonna lose

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.740 
issues going on one you're gonna lose
that<00:02:22.160> conical<00:02:22.760> shape<00:02:22.970> which<00:02:23.209> gives<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.540> good

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
that conical shape which gives you good

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.240 
that conical shape which gives you good
flow<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.260> then<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.650> thinner<00:02:24.860> metal<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
flow and then that thinner metal is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.410 
flow and then that thinner metal is
going<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> whole<00:02:25.790> nother<00:02:26.000> host<00:02:26.240> of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
going to be a whole nother host of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.699 
going to be a whole nother host of
progress<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:26.990> then<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.350> piece<00:02:27.560> right

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
progress and then on this piece right

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.290 
progress and then on this piece right
here<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.040> got<00:02:28.220> consistent<00:02:28.940> material

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
here you got consistent material

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.400 
here you got consistent material
thickness<00:02:29.450> which<00:02:29.810> makes<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.110> whole<00:02:30.230> piece

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
thickness which makes the whole piece

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.990 
thickness which makes the whole piece
stronger<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.980> easier<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> weld<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.880> you're

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
stronger and easier to weld so you're

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.130 
stronger and easier to weld so you're
not<00:02:32.090> going<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.270> be<00:02:32.360> burning<00:02:32.570> through<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:32.990> a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
not going to be burning through like a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.170 
not going to be burning through like a
lot<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.500> people<00:02:33.709> do<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:33.920> exhaust<00:02:34.220> exactly

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
lot of people do on exhaust exactly

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210 
lot of people do on exhaust exactly
which<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> very<00:02:35.720> good<00:02:35.780> thing<00:02:36.110> Phyllis<00:02:36.709> yeah

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
which is a very good thing Phyllis yeah

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.930 
which is a very good thing Phyllis yeah
so<00:02:37.340> let's<00:02:37.490> go<00:02:37.580> put<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:37.850> in<00:02:39.820> alright<00:02:40.820> now

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
so let's go put this in alright now

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.949 
so let's go put this in alright now
we've<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.180> both<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> driver<00:02:41.690> side<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
we've got both the driver side and

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.600 
we've got both the driver side and
passenger<00:02:42.230> side<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.160> it's<00:02:43.280> time<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.550> us

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
passenger side in and it's time for us

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.310 
passenger side in and it's time for us
to<00:02:43.730> put<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> two<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.480> one<00:02:44.630> collector<00:02:45.110> so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
to put the two in the one collector so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320 
to put the two in the one collector so
we<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.560> run<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.400> three<00:02:46.610> inch<00:02:46.730> exhaust<00:02:46.910> out

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
we can run the three inch exhaust out

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.970 
we can run the three inch exhaust out
from<00:02:47.660> there<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.470> we're<00:02:48.560> gonna<00:02:48.680> put<00:02:48.890> at

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
from there and we're gonna put at

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.280 
from there and we're gonna put at
somewhat<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.880> an<00:02:50.030> angle<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.019> go<00:02:51.170> ahead

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
somewhat of an angle so we can go ahead

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.229 
somewhat of an angle so we can go ahead
and<00:02:51.470> clear<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.489> transmission<00:02:53.030> crossmember

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
and clear the transmission crossmember

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.720 
and clear the transmission crossmember
and<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.230> will<00:02:54.350> allow<00:02:54.769> us<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> use<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.340> exhaust

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
and it will allow us to use our exhaust

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.449 
and it will allow us to use our exhaust
hangers<00:02:56.209> now<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:56.780> could<00:02:57.200> go<00:02:57.860> ahead<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.220> put<00:02:58.370> an

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
hangers now we could go ahead and put an

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.370 
hangers now we could go ahead and put an
S<00:02:58.640> Pen<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.030> there<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.390> creates<00:02:59.810> a<00:03:00.019> lot<00:03:00.350> of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
S Pen in there but that creates a lot of

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.410 
S Pen in there but that creates a lot of
cutting<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.130> lot<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.370> welding<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
cutting and a lot of welding and it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.940 
cutting and a lot of welding and it
takes<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.720> lot<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.989> time<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.650> going<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.890> go

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
takes a lot of time I'm just going to go

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.810 
takes a lot of time I'm just going to go
ahead<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.400> do<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> easy<00:03:04.850> way

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
ahead and do it the easy way

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:18.180 
ahead and do it the easy way

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.229 

all<00:03:19.190> right<00:03:19.310> now<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.760> tacked<00:03:20.060> together

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
all right now it's all tacked together

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.240 
all right now it's all tacked together
let's<00:03:20.750> see<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.140> removability<00:03:21.650> works<00:03:22.040> now

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
let's see if this removability works now

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
let's see if this removability works now
this<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.670> one<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.000> reasons<00:03:23.330> why<00:03:23.629> we

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
this is the one of the reasons why we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.660 
this is the one of the reasons why we
wanted<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.440> make<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.620> removable<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.489> could

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
wanted to make it removable so we could

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.729 
wanted to make it removable so we could
go<00:03:25.760> ahead<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.180> pull<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.569> all<00:03:26.660> out<00:03:26.690> weld<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.650> on

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
go ahead and pull it all out weld it on

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.530 
go ahead and pull it all out weld it on
the<00:03:27.860> table<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.550> we<00:03:28.640> have<00:03:28.790> nice<00:03:29.030> good<00:03:29.360> clean

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
the table so we have nice good clean

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.589 
the table so we have nice good clean

wells all the way around well here it is
proof<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.440> came<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:34.099> is<00:03:34.340> removable

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
proof that it came out it is removable

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.490 
proof that it came out it is removable
and<00:03:35.180> believe<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.480> or<00:03:35.540> not<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.900> actually<00:03:35.930> came

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
and believe it or not it actually came

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.619 
and believe it or not it actually came

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
welder don't think that all you have to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.600 
welder don't think that all you have to
do<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.140> tip<00:03:42.379> weld<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.680> can<00:03:42.830> actually<00:03:42.980> MIG<00:03:43.370> weld

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610

this section right here now on this part
right<00:03:49.849> here<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:50.630> got<00:03:51.530> super<00:03:52.130> lucky<00:03:52.370> or<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.819> guess

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
right here I got super lucky or I guess

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.880 
right here I got super lucky or I guess
you<00:03:53.450> could<00:03:53.599> call<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.780> skill<00:03:54.230> because<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.650> didn't

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
you could call it skill because I didn't

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.199 
you could call it skill because I didn't
have<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.099> cut<00:03:55.250> any<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.730> off<00:03:56.000> this

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
have to cut any of this off this

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.569 
have to cut any of this off this
measurement<00:03:56.989> was<00:03:57.140> perfect<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.010> then<00:03:58.400> right

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
measurement was perfect and then right

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.370

here<00:03:58.610> I'm<00:03:59.239> going<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.420> go<00:03:59.510> ahead<00:03:59.599> and<00:03:59.810> flange<00:04:00.140> it

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
here I'm going to go ahead and flange it

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.160 
here I'm going to go ahead and flange it
to<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.890> muffler<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.910> muffler<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.299> just<00:04:02.930> as

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
to the muffler so the muffler is just as

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.860 
to the muffler so the muffler is just as
removable<00:04:03.739> as<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.129> rest<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.670> now<00:04:05.329> when<00:04:05.810> I'm

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
removable as the rest of it now when I'm

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.539 
removable as the rest of it now when I'm
done<00:04:06.049> with<00:04:06.170> all<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.620> I'm<00:04:07.129> gonna<00:04:07.280> go<00:04:07.459> ahead

this<00:04:22.370> thing<00:04:22.430> together<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.910> us<00:04:32.320> now<00:04:33.320> when

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
this thing together for us now when

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.990 
this thing together for us now when
you're<00:04:33.620> welding<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:34.010> lot<00:04:34.190> especially<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
you're welding a lot especially on the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.760 
you're welding a lot especially on the
thinner<00:04:35.240> metals<00:04:35.570> make<00:04:35.750> sure<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.960> jump<00:04:36.350> around

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
thinner metals make sure you jump around

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.080 
thinner metals make sure you jump around
that<00:04:37.070> way<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.250> don't<00:04:37.490> create<00:04:37.730> heat

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
that way you don't create heat

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.710 
that way you don't create heat
distortion<00:04:38.420> causing<00:04:39.290> warpage<00:04:43.600> when<00:04:44.600> you're

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
distortion causing warpage when you're

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240 
distortion causing warpage when you're
putting<00:04:44.900> in<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.200> centerpiece<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.040> good

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
putting in the centerpiece it's a good

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.860 
putting in the centerpiece it's a good
idea<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.580> make<00:04:46.760> sure<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.300> measurements

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
idea to make sure that the measurements

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.870 
idea to make sure that the measurements
are<00:04:47.960> equal<00:04:48.350> all<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.800> way<00:04:48.890> around<00:04:49.280> cuz<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:49.730> it's

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
are equal all the way around cuz if it's

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.220 
are equal all the way around cuz if it's
in<00:04:50.000> there<00:04:50.150> crooked<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.750> put<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.080> your

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
in there crooked and you put in your

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.380 
in there crooked and you put in your
tubes<00:04:51.500> those<00:04:52.130> tubes<00:04:52.490> are<00:04:52.730> not<00:04:53.000> going<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.270> meet

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
tubes those tubes are not going to meet

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.610 
tubes those tubes are not going to meet
up<00:04:53.510> with<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.750> end<00:04:53.900> caps<00:04:58.870> all<00:04:59.870> right<00:05:00.200> now<00:05:00.410> it's

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
up with the end caps all right now it's

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.290 
up with the end caps all right now it's
time<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.830> go<00:05:01.010> ahead<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.370> install<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.850> louvers

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
time to go ahead and install the louvers

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.090 
time to go ahead and install the louvers
now<00:05:02.780> there's<00:05:02.990> two<00:05:03.230> things<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.800> really

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
now there's two things that you really

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.520 
now there's two things that you really
want<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.520> make<00:05:04.700> sure<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.270> you're<00:05:05.420> doing<00:05:05.900> one

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
want to make sure that you're doing one

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.800 
want to make sure that you're doing one
is<00:05:06.800> when<00:05:07.070> people<00:05:07.250> install<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:08.060> they<00:05:08.450> want<00:05:08.720> to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
is when people install it they want to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.450 
is when people install it they want to
do<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.080> so<00:05:09.320> these<00:05:09.500> louvers<00:05:09.830> are<00:05:10.130> actually

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
do it so these louvers are actually

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.159 
do it so these louvers are actually
scooping<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.030> air<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.419> spreading<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.080> out

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
scooping the air and spreading it out

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.170 
scooping the air and spreading it out
through<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.470> rest<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.860> case<00:05:13.100> but<00:05:13.850> really

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
through the rest of the case but really

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.330 
through the rest of the case but really
what<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.510> want<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.780> do<00:05:14.930> is<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.590> want<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.919> flip

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
what you want to do is you want to flip

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.250 
what you want to do is you want to flip
it<00:05:16.490> around<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.090> have<00:05:17.270> those<00:05:17.450> louvers<00:05:17.690> facing

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
it around and have those louvers facing

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.740 
it around and have those louvers facing
down<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.919> air<00:05:19.100> flows<00:05:19.460> nicely<00:05:19.880> through<00:05:20.570> it

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
down so the air flows nicely through it

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.750 
down so the air flows nicely through it
and<00:05:20.930> then<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.530> steel<00:05:21.800> wool<00:05:22.100> is<00:05:22.400> what<00:05:22.580> actually

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
and then the steel wool is what actually

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.150 
and then the steel wool is what actually
dissipates<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.720> sound<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.800> other<00:05:24.919> thing

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
dissipates the sound and the other thing

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.740 
dissipates the sound and the other thing
you<00:05:25.190> want<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.460> make<00:05:25.520> sure<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.570> they're

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
you want to make sure of is that they're
