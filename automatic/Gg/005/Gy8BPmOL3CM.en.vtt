00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
trifold card die something like that

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.090 
trifold card die something like that
from<00:06:42.310> Sizzix<00:06:42.580> and<00:06:43.510> I<00:06:43.900> tried<00:06:44.230> making<00:06:44.500> that<00:06:44.860> but

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
from Sizzix and I tried making that but

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.220 
from Sizzix and I tried making that but
it<00:06:45.730> was<00:06:45.970> a<00:06:46.000> little<00:06:46.330> bit<00:06:46.450> too<00:06:46.630> small<00:06:46.900> for<00:06:47.080> my

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
it was a little bit too small for my

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.530 
it was a little bit too small for my
project<00:06:47.740> so<00:06:48.040> I<00:06:48.100> needed<00:06:48.850> something<00:06:48.970> a<00:06:49.330> little

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
project so I needed something a little

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.240 
project so I needed something a little
bit<00:06:49.630> bigger<00:06:49.750> so<00:06:50.110> I<00:06:50.140> did<00:06:50.380> mine<00:06:50.590> in<00:06:50.620> a<00:06:50.920> little<00:06:50.950> bit

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
bit bigger so I did mine in a little bit

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.640 
bit bigger so I did mine in a little bit
different<00:06:51.610> way<00:06:51.760> but<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:52.630> effect<00:06:53.110> came<00:06:53.380> out<00:06:53.530> in

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
different way but the effect came out in

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.990
