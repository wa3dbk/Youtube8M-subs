00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
some extra milk handy because you never

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440 
some extra milk handy because you never
know<00:01:19.040> when<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.189> cooking<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.640> flour<00:01:20.939> just

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
know when you're cooking with flour just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
know when you're cooking with flour just
how<00:01:21.689> much<00:01:21.900> liquid<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> need<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
if that isn't enough you might need a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.359 
if that isn't enough you might need a
little<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.640> liquid<00:01:27.680> which<00:01:28.680> indeed<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
little bit more liquid which indeed I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.690

think we're going to so we'll just dive

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
think we're going to so we'll just dive
into<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> milk<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.549> think<00:01:36.680> almost

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
into the milk here and have think almost

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
into the milk here and have think almost
a<00:01:38.070> tablespoonful<00:01:38.850> I'll<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.720> on

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
floured surface just shape it start off

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080 
floured surface just shape it start off
by<00:02:33.150> shaping<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.750> into<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.230> round<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.340> I'll<00:02:35.910> just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
by shaping it into a round and I'll just

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.040 
by shaping it into a round and I'll just
tidy<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.960> my<00:02:37.140> hands<00:02:37.380> there<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.510> where

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
tidy up my hands there and this is where

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.540 
tidy up my hands there and this is where
most<00:02:40.230> people<00:02:40.380> go<00:02:40.709> wrong<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.370> make

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
most people go wrong when they make

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.170 
most people go wrong when they make
scones<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.220> roll<00:02:44.459> them<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.760> far

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
scones it's that they roll them out far

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
scones it's that they roll them out far
too<00:02:45.209> thinly<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:46.890> they<00:02:47.010> don't<00:02:47.100> come<00:02:47.310> up

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
too thinly and then they don't come up

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.160 
too thinly and then they don't come up
very<00:02:47.490> high<00:02:47.880> some<00:02:48.540> people<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:48.959> can't

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
very high some people think they can't

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.530 
very high some people think they can't
make<00:02:49.230> scones<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.580> secret<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.150> I'll<00:02:51.510> just

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
make scones so the secret is I'll just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.880 
make scones so the secret is I'll just
give<00:02:51.959> my<00:02:52.140> rolling<00:02:52.560> pin<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.740> little<00:02:52.860> bit

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
give my rolling pin a little bit

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.080 
give my rolling pin a little bit
the<00:02:55.890> secret<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:57.590> roll<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.620> dough<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.310> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the secret is to roll the dough out to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.280 
the secret is to roll the dough out to
not<00:03:00.330> less<00:03:02.240> than<00:03:03.240> three-quarters<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.020> an<00:03:04.200> inch

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
thick and if you're new to scone making

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.970 
thick and if you're new to scone making
then<00:03:11.730> why<00:03:12.330> not<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> ruler<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
then why not just have a ruler there and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.960 
then why not just have a ruler there and
make<00:03:14.489> sure<00:03:14.760> you've<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:15.959> less<00:03:16.230> than

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
three-quarters of an inch thick when

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.310 
three-quarters of an inch thick when
you're<00:03:19.620> rolling<00:03:19.830> them<00:03:20.130> out<00:03:21.019> now<00:03:22.019> when<00:03:22.200> you're

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
you're rolling them out now when you're

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.199 
you're rolling them out now when you're
cutting<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.769> out<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.700> need<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> two<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.150> a

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
cutting them out you need a two and a

cutting them out you need a two and a
quarter<00:03:24.570> inch<00:03:24.750> cutter<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.280> will<00:03:26.400> give

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
quarter inch cutter and this will give

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.460 
quarter inch cutter and this will give
you<00:03:26.640> about<00:03:26.850> six<00:03:27.180> or<00:03:27.360> seven<00:03:27.690> scones<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.320> this

just double the ingredients and to cut

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.880 
just double the ingredients and to cut
them<00:03:32.580> out<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.970> place<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.600> cutter<00:03:33.840> lightly<00:03:34.709> on

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
the dome like that and then just give it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.850 
the dome like that and then just give it
a<00:03:37.140> very<00:03:37.350> sharp<00:03:37.709> tap<00:03:39.470> sorry<00:03:40.470> about<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.739> noise

a very sharp tap sorry about the noise
but<00:03:41.190> that's<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.550> way<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.730> do<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.120> especially

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
but that's the way to do it especially

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.780 
but that's the way to do it especially
with<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> thick<00:03:43.110> dough<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.400> then

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
with a thick dough like this and then

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.850 
with a thick dough like this and then
just<00:03:44.820> ease<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.660> shape<00:03:45.900> out<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.590> cutter

just ease the shape out of the cutter

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.380 
just ease the shape out of the cutter
and<00:03:47.840> go<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:49.049> like<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.860> re<00:03:50.730> rolling<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and go on like that re rolling all the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.330 
and go on like that re rolling all the
scraps<00:03:51.890> until<00:03:52.890> you've<00:03:53.040> got<00:03:53.250> six<00:03:53.850> or<00:03:54.150> eight<00:03:54.780> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that with the cutter because otherwise

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.090 
that with the cutter because otherwise
they<00:04:02.430> come<00:04:02.610> out<00:04:02.640> oval<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.420> not<00:04:03.750> round<00:04:04.100> the
