00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
as we all know we can only listen on

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.919 
as we all know we can only listen on
these<00:00:13.440> through<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.219> optical<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.330> basically

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
these through the optical and basically

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
these through the optical and basically
this<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:16.859> hear<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.699> have

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this one you can just hear and you have

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.340 
this one you can just hear and you have
to<00:00:17.970> hear<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> stupid<00:00:18.840> little<00:00:18.960> thing<00:00:19.199> on

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
to hear to the stupid little thing on

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
to hear to the stupid little thing on
the<00:00:19.380> side<00:00:20.060> basically<00:00:21.060> Xbox<00:00:21.510> change<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> whole

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the side basically Xbox change the whole

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
the side basically Xbox change the whole
thing<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> bottom<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.939> basically

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
thing at the bottom so it's basically

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.040 
thing at the bottom so it's basically
useless<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.420> tonal<00:00:27.420> headset<00:00:27.930> or

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
useless if we have a tonal headset or

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.839 
useless if we have a tonal headset or
whatnot<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> show<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> them

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
whatnot so I'm going to show it to them

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
whatnot so I'm going to show it to them
a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.179> mod<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.070> little<00:00:32.279> weird

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a little mod that it's a little weird

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.940 
a little mod that it's a little weird
but<00:00:33.059> still<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> works<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.530> first<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
but still kind of works so first you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340 
but still kind of works so first you
would<00:00:35.070> need<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.880> type<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> elastic<00:00:36.750> like

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
would need a some type of elastic like

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
would need a some type of elastic like
so<00:00:37.760> your<00:00:38.760> headset<00:00:39.149> controller<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:41.430> total

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so your headset controller in your total

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.580 
so your headset controller in your total
beat<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.899> sure<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.200> total<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> each

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
beat so make sure the total of each

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
beat so make sure the total of each
already<00:00:43.950> works<00:00:44.160> through<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> optical<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
already works through the optical and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
already works through the optical and
back<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> Xbox<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.680> sure<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.039> here
