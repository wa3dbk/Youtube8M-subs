00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.330
 mt two thousand synthetic treatments of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.240
 metals is a product of last 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.250
 Especially 100% synthetic generation 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.980
 formulated to reduce wear and 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 friction in all types of injuries and 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.449
 metals that make 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 when creating a thin layer in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.649
 all internal parts of the engine 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.990
 decreases its mechanical effort and 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.260
 friction between them 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.390
 when using ideal to reduce the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.150
 friction and wear caused axles 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.550
 of turbo shirts and pistons trees 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.050
 cams including the crankshaft in a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 product that helps decrease the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 operating temperature thereof 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.180
 as well as mute noises such as 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 stand out when the engine is cold 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.830
 In addition to helping and providing excellent 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.410
 Lubrication in turbo shafts lengthening 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.340
 well its life and warranty after 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.950
 any repair 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.290
 It is ideal for engines with little or much 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.090
 mileage since you simply add it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.250
 goes to all the moving parts gives us the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.330
 guarantee to reduce the effort 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.550
 mechanical and thus its life does not affect the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.800
 good operation of any oil already 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.070
 that does not mix eat to lack of 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.479
 formol visual teflon or ceramic anus 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.900
 It is a product that we have the guarantee 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.670
 of not generating solid waste 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 throughout its use 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 to demonstrate its qualities we have 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 brought to this machine in which 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.619
 we will simulate the mechanical effort that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 is going to be subjected this roller against 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.799
 of this other departmental already in first 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.680
 place we will add a small portion of 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.299
 a synthetic 530 oil we will value your 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.189
 behavior and then we will do 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.189
 the same test with anti friction 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.200
 we add 530 the roller 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.960
 and we have a light layer 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.330
 Thank you 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.690
 the guarantee of maintaining these two phases 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 do not 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:32.220
 band selection 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.220
 greater effort and dynamics 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.159
 this river 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.950
 because the oil is not able to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.349
 keep that aerodynamic layer between 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 two metal parts undoubtedly this 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.140
 generate 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.590
 a wear 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.590
 we will proceed 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.770
 already the oil has not been able to 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 keep that and between the two parties 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.760
 metal expressed to wear the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.190
 roller 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.080
 now we will do the same test this 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.880
 once under the same condition of effort 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.730
 mechanical but this time we will add 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 our 100% synthetic antifriction mt 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.000
 of 2000 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.090
 It is important to comment that it is a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 product that is not mixed by the oil 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.270
 what do you do to adhere to all the parties 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.400
 Internal motor mobiles 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.940
 now we will put a space perfectly 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.940
 new 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.189
 I have what I say 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.870
 dynamic 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.730
 90 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.290
 the levers 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.420
 two 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.840
 in two stages 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.840
 we can not 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.620
 d 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.210
 we have increased even more 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.689
 It was 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.559
 compared 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.490
 which it has been able to generate wear this 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.380
 test 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.600
 and keeps submitting many times more 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.420
 the mechanical effort that we have 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.780
 done the beginning and we value what 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.780
 previous 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.840
 a noticeable greater wear between ones and 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.940
 others 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.590
 one of the tests 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.990
 it gives me contrasts 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.730
 that the product has managed to stay 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.009
 aerodynamic capell disc center of two 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.520
 parts 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.789
 of more than 2,000 100% satisfaction 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.789
 synthetic
