coach<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.860> talked<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.880> stance<00:00:12.420> we

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
coach we talked about the stance we

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810 
coach we talked about the stance we
talked<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.500> start<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.309> talked<00:00:14.580> about

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
talked about the start we talked about

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.660 
talked about the start we talked about
the<00:00:15.000> timing<00:00:15.619> now<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.680> need<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.070> talk<00:00:17.250> about<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the timing now we need to talk about the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.840 
the timing now we need to talk about the
arms<00:00:17.970> swing<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.650> two<00:00:20.130> views<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
arms swing of this two views of the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
arms swing of this two views of the
swing<00:00:21.180> what<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.660> call<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> side<00:00:22.230> radius<00:00:22.619> view

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
swing what we call the side radius view

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.960 
swing what we call the side radius view
and<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> direction<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and then we have the direction the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.439 
and then we have the direction the
accuracy<00:00:24.539> view<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> swing<00:00:26.060> let's<00:00:27.060> first

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
accuracy view of the swing let's first

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.599 
accuracy view of the swing let's first
talk<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:28.980> radius

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
talk a little bit about that side radius

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
talk a little bit about that side radius
view<00:00:29.939> okay<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> envision<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
view okay what you want to envision is a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
view okay what you want to envision is a
perfect<00:00:32.340> half<00:00:32.520> circle<00:00:33.059> your<00:00:33.450> body's<00:00:33.840> in

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
perfect half circle your body's in

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.600 
perfect half circle your body's in
motion<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> may<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.800> appear<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> half

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
motion so it may not appear to be a half

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
motion so it may not appear to be a half
circle<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.750> what

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
circle but that's really what it is what

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
circle but that's really what it is what
you<00:00:37.590> want<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> avoid<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.340> reaching<00:00:38.820> too<00:00:39.059> far

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you want to avoid is reaching too far

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.090 
you want to avoid is reaching too far
forward<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.079> making<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> too<00:00:40.500> flat<00:00:40.770> or

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
forward and making it too flat or

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
forward and making it too flat or
jerking<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.910> too<00:00:42.090> high<00:00:42.329> too<00:00:42.390> fast<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
jerking up too high too fast you want to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
jerking up too high too fast you want to
just<00:00:43.500> envision<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> perfect<00:00:44.399> half<00:00:44.879> circle<00:00:45.329> why

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just envision a perfect half circle why

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
just envision a perfect half circle why
don't<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.010> demonstrator<00:00:47.550> why

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
don't we just have your demonstrator why

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.670 
don't we just have your demonstrator why
don't<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.719> position<00:00:49.260> walk<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
don't you just get in position walk to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that foul line let's demonstrate that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.720 
that foul line let's demonstrate that
perfect<00:00:52.289> side<00:00:52.620> radius<00:00:53.160> view<00:00:55.699> which<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
perfect side radius view which you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
perfect side radius view which you
notice<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.420> struck<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.199> toward<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
notice just struck right up toward the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
notice just struck right up toward the
ceiling<00:00:58.800> perfect<00:00:59.789> half<00:01:00.059> circle<00:01:00.750> nice<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
ceiling perfect half circle nice and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.160 
ceiling perfect half circle nice and
smooth<00:01:02.510> would<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> throw<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> good

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
smooth would you throw it that good

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
smooth would you throw it that good
every<00:01:04.409> time<00:01:04.439> coach<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.070> wish<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:06.390> pretty<00:01:06.570> easy

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
every time coach I wish it's pretty easy

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
every time coach I wish it's pretty easy
to<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.080> without<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.350> ball<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.950> real<00:01:08.159> hard<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to do without a ball it's real hard to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
to do without a ball it's real hard to
do<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> slow<00:01:08.909> motion<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> ball<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:09.900> we're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
do a slow motion with the ball so we're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
do a slow motion with the ball so we're
doing<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> without<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.770> ball<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> look<00:01:11.760> at

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
doing it without a ball but you look at

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.789 
doing it without a ball but you look at
that<00:01:12.000> half<00:01:12.240> circle<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> repeat<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that half circle you want to repeat the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.399 
that half circle you want to repeat the
half<00:01:13.979> circle<00:01:14.400> again<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.509> coach<00:01:15.840> alluded<00:01:16.290> to

half circle again as coach alluded to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
half circle again as coach alluded to
it's<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.100> extension<00:01:17.460> reach<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it's not an over extension reach and

it's not an over extension reach and
it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> snap<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> full<00:01:19.740> extension

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it's not a snap up it's a full extension

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
it's not a snap up it's a full extension
