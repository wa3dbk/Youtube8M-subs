00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi everyone I am godzilla long millenium 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
 and today I come with a very short new video 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 but important which is the first of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 many videos about the movies that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.559
 What movies are we going to find out? 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 in this year's comic-con on the panel 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 of legends and the same confirmed a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 new movie called King Kong 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.289
 school and Ivan which is close to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 debut in 2016 and if it were 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.010
 Little Gareth Edwards confirmed that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.080
 will lead godzilla 2 when he finishes 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 record a spin-off of star wars either 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.759
 boba fedio dauhajre beings ok that last 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 no but that gareth will lead gods and already 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.649
 after recording star wars so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 we would have godzilla 2 by the end of 2016 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.719
 or in 2017 as pacific rim 2 because 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.120
 disney because the film of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
 godzilla that back in star wars and we 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.079
 give the sequel to godzilla but what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.539
 that I am sure is that the wait 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 It will be worth it because then for the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 motorcycle confirmation and the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 possible main villain quin and dora in 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 the movie like this is monsters of all if 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 they want to search the internet this came out 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.619
 from the mouth of Gareth Edwards himself 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 do not rule out that one that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.960
 another script change but who knows 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.330
 these 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 in the comic-con I expect many things from 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.049
 this that please the new movie of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 King Kong is in the same universe as 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.550
 the godzilla theft maybe that never 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 cross but if in the same universe there 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.659
 it's crazy because legendary has the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 rights of the two characters too 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.710
 I hope godzilla appears more time 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.560
 on screen and the other monsters 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
 also as he said tl 2b in his video 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 godzilla 2 to include am another or roll 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.040
 it would need a super monster 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 evil and powerful that godzilla can not 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
 stop on your own may not be 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 the only monsters in the movie 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.660
 I hope they bring us to the abyss that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 legend and he owes it to us after the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.920
 thunder of the comic-con in 2012 and 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.929
 I also expect the return of many or 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.759
 several many like the muscular world 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.160
 that it seems like orga that they showed us in the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.990
 concepts this last of abyss and mutated 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.780
 I hope so or it has not been confirmed 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 an idea came to me maybe we'll see the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.649
 Guido remake now to create in 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 monsters we have the four monsters 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.240
 I also hope that if the cast returns 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.670
 original which is very likely since 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.530
 it's an American movie I hope 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.420
 that Aaron Taylor Johnson improves his 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 acting and have expressions and not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.110
 I passed everything and do not pass 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.330
 as in the first movie and that it be 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 a story totally different from the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.530
 of guido to believe in monsters and that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.390
 far surpasses the last movie and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.750
 now a list of the films of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.860
 legendary jurassic world 2015 school and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.590
 2016 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.420
 godzilla 2 2016 or 2017 pacific rim 2 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.580
 2017 the giant monsters are us 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 sum king kong so soon reviews 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.019
 the legend area exception of flavors or 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.030
 veil since it seems from those movies of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.220
 current terror that scare you into 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 the whole screen like a screen air but 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.060
 I'm going to give it a try and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.340
 soon my critique of the trilogy of 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.769
 transformers and when godzilla comes out the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.989
 September 16 leaves one more critic 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.239
 I will do the same with transformers 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.400
 the era of extinction and to conclude 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.200
 this short video I leave you with this phrase 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.269
 what I invented will be that legendary 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.390
 revived the giant monsters in the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.970
 cinema we'll see you in a next video and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.950
 for those who say godzilla 2014 is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.750
 a crap that they prefer that although 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.329
 leave very little respect all the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.190
 characteristics of the character or a 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.819
 aberration that has nothing to do with 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.950
 the staff 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.780
 and they only name it because if I 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.659
 I prefer the first one at least if it is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.730
 godzilla I am also planning that the 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.709
 next video be a mini review to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.749
 godzilla neca but that I see very little 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.879
 probable since my camera is not very 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.530
 good quality that we say but with nothing 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.379
 more than saying I say goodbye until the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.269
 next lie the news came 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.310
 accompanied with two to be done in the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.290
 first we see a monarch video where 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.450
 we see the picture of a pteranodon a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.939
 moth and three dragon heads all 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.859
 we know what that means comes to me 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.200
 to the head that at the beginning nozzle 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.090
 fight against another and roland and then the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.099
 three become allies to stop 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.230
 a super powerful enemy kings and dora 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.790
 the second one makes you walk around a 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.799
 jungle until it shows us the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.019
 gigantic monkey kim with roaring and 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.739
 hitting his chest like he always does 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.449
 xd 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.040
 I would like that above the poster of 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.840
 king kong tell of the company that you 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.569
 brought godzilla arrives at king kong 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.880
 that would be epic xd now yes without more 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.099
 news we say goodbye and if someone who 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.109
 saw this video and went to the comic-con for 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.180
 please if you recorded something put a small 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.250
 image because I can not stand seeing king anymore 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.250
 good kong now yes until next time
