after<00:02:25.940> though<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.450> they<00:02:26.630> harden<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.050> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
after though just so they harden up a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.750 
after though just so they harden up a
little<00:02:27.350> bit<00:02:27.500> more<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.459> want<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> be

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
little bit more so if you want to be

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.880 
little bit more so if you want to be
really<00:02:28.970> technical<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.590> make<00:02:30.739> sure

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
really technical and to make sure

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.590 
really technical and to make sure
everything<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.400> even<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.940> would<00:02:32.180> recommend

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
everything is even I would recommend

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.510 
everything is even I would recommend
using<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.260> scale<00:02:33.590> putting<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.310> this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
using a scale putting all of this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.670 
using a scale putting all of this
mixture<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:35.030> another<00:02:35.300> Bowl<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> scale<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
mixture in another Bowl in the scale and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.440 
mixture in another Bowl in the scale and
then<00:02:36.860> dividing<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> by<00:02:37.459> six<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.180> making

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
then dividing it by six and then making

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.150 
then dividing it by six and then making
each<00:02:38.720> ball<00:02:39.019> I'm<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.800> gonna<00:02:39.890> eye<00:02:39.980> it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
each ball I'm not I'm just gonna eye it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.860 
each ball I'm not I'm just gonna eye it
so<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.670> one<00:02:40.880> looks<00:02:41.090> smaller<00:02:41.390> than<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> other

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
so if one looks smaller than the other

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:55.490 
so if one looks smaller than the other
I'm<00:02:42.080> gonna<00:02:42.230> try<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.500> make<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.920> even

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.030 

okay<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.310> here's<00:02:56.880> our<00:02:57.150> fat<00:02:58.080> bomb<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.890> can
