00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 cinnamon trillo the most open television 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.720
 that never exactly any of you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 experienced an astral trip to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 explain clearly what these are 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.630
 parapsychologist travel with us in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.740
 ex eyelet welcome doctor or the artist 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.350
 which are exactly the best we have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 had and we do not know more astral travel 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 in fact I would like to start saying 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.720
 that all of us every day 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 we have astral travel not the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 we remember when we sleep 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 we have several phases of sleep we have 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 from the symbolic light sleep the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 revolution of the two and when we entered 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 in the phase of deep sleep that is mor 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 rapid eye movements we have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 sexual astral experiences 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 spiritual and we all go out all the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 days but we are not aware of it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 there are people who come to take 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.059
 awareness within those trips and that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 what they can not conceive as a trip 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.250
 conscious astral but we all do 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.020
 every day that's awesome and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.399
 how could we define an astral trip 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.890
 what is the difference between a trip to 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.190
 of a dream has not gone very well what 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.140
 same no 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.940
 we have to start defining ourselves 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.470
 we have a physical body and we are not 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.270
 trinitarian we do not have a soul a 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.159
 spirit and a physical body when 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 we sleep the physical body is 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.990
 stay still and get the spirit 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.000
 they have experiences and we have a body 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.009
 be that have extracorporeal experiences 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 then when we fall asleep 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.840
 we have those experiences that are very 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.509
 vivid very intense colors we come to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.369
 somatize pains sensations those are 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.259
 the experiences and when it is a dream 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.720
 there is only one memory and sometimes 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.850
 it is usually forgotten but what is 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.649
 an experience that was unreal that is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.780
 an astral experience stays very 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.130
 marked and it is very well remembered that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.200
 I do not think it is true that we all have 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 past that suddenly you're thinking about 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 something you dreamed about or trying to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.640
 remember it and the colors are much more 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.250
 children and the smells and the deepest and 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.679
 the people are more them than in the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 reality indeed the world is much 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.100
 more clear than this this physical world 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.080
 as I was being through a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.179
 crystal that is not very clean the world 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.649
 astral is different now what is it that 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.360
 it happens when we go out on 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.950
 Monday since you would be that really 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 what do you think are awake and that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.600
 you are in the place exactly in fact 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.870
 I'm going to ask now right now 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.310
 we are in a dream but I do not know how 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.830
 I could know we do not have parameters 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.900
 really to know if clear or not 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.550
 there is a clear parameter if it happens to you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 things in reality that you feel you've 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.170
 dreamed before is something they call 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.450
 exactly when when people start to 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 have astral travel and start them 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.190
 remember sometimes you do not know when you are in 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.410
 an astral trip or when it is in the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 physical plane in wake living then 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.050
 some scene then there is a way that 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.420
 the master samuel mentioned to a seer 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.950
 pull a finger 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.160
 this is this is something that a lot of people 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.020
 is practicing and suddenly awake 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.690
 and I do not know if I'm in a dream or not 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.040
 then they pull a finger if it is 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.900
 stretch you are in an energetic body and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.459
 there are practices that you can take to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.290
 make an astral trip always through 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.360
 of the dream to not have risk because 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.920
 it comes to have some risks when 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 we do not do it of our own volition 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.060
 let's remember that we have a will 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.230
 the agency so allows us to decide 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 for ourselves that we want 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.290
 we do not want then when we 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.030
 we want to make an astral trip to 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.220
 will we sit down with my ribbon 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.379
 I close my eyes between a state 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.659
 appropriate mental and my project 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.909
 then that has a risk because 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.319
 we went out of the laws that I 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.849
 protect the natural laws that I 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.950
 protect but when it's done through 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.420
 of the dream there is absolutely no 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 risk astral travel have 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.390
 recurrence because for example I do not know 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.890
 if it happens to you or to the people who 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.560
 he was listening to us and seeing in his 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.390
 home but we have people that we dream 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.599
 with constantly with very 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.980
 similar the same taught many times 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.650
 when the recurrent sleep does not 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.120
 necessarily are Freud astral travel 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.650
 which for me is the best that exist 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.720
 interpretation of dreams you want the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.329
 dreams are unfinished business 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.739
 then in different parts of the dream 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.349
 and we have a way of 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.359
 compensate for those emotions that we could not 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.650
 to wake up and what can they do to us? 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.390
 noise inside of us the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.700
 subconscious and then during the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.700
 dream we can do for example you have 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.080
 a boss who wants to mistreat you 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:22.340
 widowed you can touch it because you're running 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:24.020
 but the dream if then you already 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.389
 you took away for my trip gives me the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.220
 print as a passport come up in a 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.530
 transport and let's go two as I do not know is 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.270
 in the plane of the form with a person 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.460
 is conscious and is in the astral plane 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.169
 you can move to where you want 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.550
 instantaneously for example its habitat 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.320
 or tickets here sitting on a trip 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.110
 astral and you have some relative in china 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.700
 instantly move china is much more 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.960
 fast that the speed of the maya is 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.960
 more canyon than that in my dreams 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.390
 that is a desire for freedom or maybe 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.100
 your astral goal could be for you 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.320
 true but I go to places that I do not know 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.350
 you know it will even be done there and fly your 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.660
 party in addition and landed that returns 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.490
 with me and I raise myself again 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.169
 like and bony but they are places where 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.820
 I never been has characteristics of 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.790
 an astral trip if you become aware 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.710
 on that trip to what I do follow from the finger and 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.000
 You can go wherever you want because if I want 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.990
 be right now for example in paris or 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.670
 I want to be in Brazil 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.530
 I do not want to be in the auto studio 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.090
 who will be instantly in 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.040
 this plane there is no time bid 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.760
 can have astral travel awake or 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 necessarily be asleep 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.750
 it is important to get into the state 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.400
 because there is a detachment from your 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.170
 essence of the energetic body without 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.370
 However, being open- eyed 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.140
 as for example right now you can 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.510
 project that yes you can do 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.760
 astral projections or that is the same 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.990
 than an astral trip but you do not have the 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.700
 evidence that you have in an astral trip 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.470
 if I arrived who registered this 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.300
 predict how you're dressed as it comes 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.940
 soto Luis but in a projection 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.710
 psychic not of bioenergetics because 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.680
 the amount of remembrance is not so 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.420
 immediate to what I'm going with this is if you 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.180
 would you really want to remember or so 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.160
 less in my case what I dreamed to precision 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.100
 it costs me a little work I have 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.500
 episodes but not precision we have a 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.360
 system that is precisely for that 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.610
 when we dream at the moment 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.620
 that we wake up you remember the dream 16 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.550
 study, you get up, you feel, they put you 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.590
 the screens to lift the 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.020
 Internet user may be the sixth would have to 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.759
 to have 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.979
 and write down the points that can 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.469
 shoot that memory and if you can 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.089
 remember of course you get scared with what 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.309
 that you dream because it has happened to me 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.659
 prophetic sometimes I dream of 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.809
 someone who is going to get sick 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.550
 provided always nice that's not so 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.349
 clear but good if you can do it and 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.969
 you can write down your dreams and after 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.770
 after a month you compare what 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.629
 you have lived, you will be surprised at what 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.069
 you find and welfare of course 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.689
 like that that flies so you go to 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.999
 different places is completely 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.620
 possible because today at night I propose you 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:55.550
 an astral trip to my cat from your bed myself 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.409
 in mine or home and you can talk 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.149
 on the other hand you can find the 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:02.539
 astral dreams we agree and 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:04.849
 nothing is good good but if moving 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.889
