we have the X hundreds you have these
two<00:01:39.180> guys<00:01:39.330> bit<00:01:39.690> bite<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.230> show<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.860> random

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
two guys bit bite that show up at random

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
two guys bit bite that show up at random
levels<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:42.330> they're<00:01:42.659> never<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.080> same

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
levels there's they're never the same

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.550 
levels there's they're never the same
level<00:01:43.590> twice<00:01:44.370> it<00:01:44.730> really<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.060> random<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
level twice it really is random so if

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
level twice it really is random so if
you<00:01:46.680> run<00:01:46.860> across<00:01:46.980> them<00:01:47.400> later<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> may<00:01:49.110> get

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
you run across them later on you may get

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
you run across them later on you may get
them<00:01:49.440> at<00:01:49.590> different<00:01:49.800> times<00:01:50.190> in<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.700> see

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
them at different times in what you see

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.950 
them at different times in what you see
in<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.240> videos<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:53.240> I'll<00:01:54.240> talk<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.810> bit

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
in my videos so I'll talk a little bit

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.030 
in my videos so I'll talk a little bit
more<00:01:55.080> about<00:01:55.140> them<00:01:55.440> when<00:01:55.620> we<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> those

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
more about them when we have those

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.370 
more about them when we have those
fights

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.010 

so<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:03.300> they<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:03.780> show<00:02:03.990> up

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so if you don't if they don't show up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
so if you don't if they don't show up
then<00:02:04.440> you'll<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.710> come<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.550> those<00:02:05.670> rooms<00:02:05.970> and

then you'll just come to those rooms and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:23.850 
then you'll just come to those rooms and
just<00:02:06.240> move<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.020> through

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.960

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
powered up shot and he goes down pretty

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:35.110 
powered up shot and he goes down pretty
quickly

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:04:07.450 

you

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:20.349 

you

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.320 

okay<00:04:21.359> Tunnel<00:04:21.959> rhino<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:23.400> guy's<00:04:23.580> actual

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
okay Tunnel rhino this guy's actual

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.180 
okay Tunnel rhino this guy's actual
weaknesses<00:04:24.780> i<00:04:24.960> think<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.229> acid<00:04:25.620> burst<00:04:25.860> but

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
weaknesses i think the acid burst but

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.409 
weaknesses i think the acid burst but
since<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.550> have<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.790> we're<00:04:27.300> just

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
since we don't have that we're just

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.730 
since we don't have that we're just
going<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.750> use<00:04:27.930> our<00:04:28.020> X<00:04:28.169> Buster<00:04:28.530> and

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
going to have to use our X Buster and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.189 
going to have to use our X Buster and
he's<00:04:29.610> pretty<00:04:29.760> much<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.210> just<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.600> rhino<00:04:30.870> he

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
he's pretty much is just like a rhino he

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.400 
he's pretty much is just like a rhino he
sort<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.130> charges<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.210> hits<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.169> wall

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
sort of just charges and hits the wall

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.719 
sort of just charges and hits the wall
there<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.889> notice<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.130> sometimes<00:04:35.430> he

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
there but you notice that sometimes he

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.450 
there but you notice that sometimes he
only<00:04:35.850> goes<00:04:36.030> halfway<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.919> really<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.070> trick<00:04:38.280> is

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
only goes halfway so really the trick is

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.950 
only goes halfway so really the trick is
to<00:04:38.490> climb<00:04:38.970> on<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> wall<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.419> jump<00:04:39.660> over<00:04:39.720> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
to climb on the wall and jump over and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.480 
to climb on the wall and jump over and
pretty<00:04:40.110> much<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.440> same<00:04:40.620> tactic<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.310> did

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
pretty much the same tactic that you did

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.879 
pretty much the same tactic that you did
for<00:04:41.520> Blizzard<00:04:42.240> Buffalo<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.470> thing<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.740> need

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
for Blizzard Buffalo the thing you need

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.890 
for Blizzard Buffalo the thing you need
to<00:04:43.949> watch<00:04:44.100> out<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.340> though<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:45.000> if<00:04:45.479> he<00:04:45.660> does<00:04:45.870> a

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
to watch out for though is if he does a

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.370 
to watch out for though is if he does a
shortened<00:04:47.000> attack<00:04:48.000> don't<00:04:48.630> jump<00:04:48.900> over<00:04:49.200> him<00:04:49.260> you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
shortened attack don't jump over him you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
shortened attack don't jump over him you
need<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.590> stay<00:04:49.740> on<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.950> same<00:04:50.130> side<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
need to stay on the same side of the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.909 
need to stay on the same side of the
wall<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.750> sort<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.020> want<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.320> climb<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
wall so you sort of want to climb the

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.590 
wall so you sort of want to climb the
wall<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.340> then<00:04:53.460> jump<00:04:54.000> only<00:04:54.330> at<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.479> last

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
wall and then jump only at the last

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.940 
wall and then jump only at the last
second<00:04:55.110> when<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.320> notice<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.770> he's

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
second when you notice that he's

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.010 
second when you notice that he's
actually<00:04:56.220> committed<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.940> hit<00:04:57.270> ramming<00:04:57.900> into

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
actually committed to hit ramming into

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.969 
actually committed to hit ramming into
the<00:04:58.169> wall<00:05:00.260> secondly<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.380> thing<00:05:01.560> does<00:05:01.740> right

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
the wall secondly the thing does right

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.050 
the wall secondly the thing does right
there<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.340> when<00:05:02.490> he<00:05:02.580> sort<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.850> turns

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
there is when he sort of turns

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.870 
there is when he sort of turns
psychedelic<00:05:03.690> colors<00:05:04.700> sort<00:05:05.700> of<00:05:05.790> an
