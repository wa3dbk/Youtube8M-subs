relaxed hair or has hair relaxed hair
and<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.890> through<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> process<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
and they go through the process of

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
and they go through the process of
transitioning<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> become<00:00:44.309> natural<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> they

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
transitioning to become natural and they

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920 
transitioning to become natural and they
go<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> cliq<00:00:46.410> process<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.719> they<00:00:48.719> see

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
go through the cliq process and they see

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.830 
go through the cliq process and they see
how<00:00:49.050> their<00:00:49.260> hair<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> true<00:00:49.920> has<00:00:50.129> transformed

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
how their hair is true has transformed

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
how their hair is true has transformed
from<00:00:51.840> being<00:00:51.930> relaxed<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.980> natural<00:00:53.010> there

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
from being relaxed to natural there

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
from being relaxed to natural there
seems<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> different<00:00:55.020> type<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> texture

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
seems to be a different type of texture

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.549 
seems to be a different type of texture
of<00:00:56.010> course<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.020> blow<00:00:58.289> dry<00:00:58.530> your

speak it straightens it but you see the
Afro<00:01:05.700> effect<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> hair<00:01:08.479> my<00:01:09.479> question<00:01:09.990> is

is<00:01:32.930> straight<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.520> question<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> sense

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
is straight so my question is in a sense

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.370 
is straight so my question is in a sense
is<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:38.360> two<00:01:39.360> different<00:01:39.930> types<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.439> natural

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
is there two different types of natural

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.789 
is there two different types of natural
hair<00:01:43.850> like<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.780> section<00:01:46.530> for

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
hair like it there there's a section for

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
hair like it there there's a section for
this<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.670> there's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> section<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this and then there's a section for that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.850 
this and then there's a section for that
because<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.340> person<00:01:51.000> may<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.079> afro<00:01:52.500> but

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
because that person may want an afro but

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.749 
because that person may want an afro but
cannot<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.939> their<00:01:54.180> hair<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.710> do<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.070> even

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
cannot get their hair to do that even

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
cannot get their hair to do that even
though<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:57.600> natural<00:01:59.390> if<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.659> makes<00:02:00.810> sense

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
though they're natural if it makes sense

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.649 
though they're natural if it makes sense

think there is a difference between the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.760 
think there is a difference between the
natural<00:02:35.980> process<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:37.840> with<00:02:38.110> there<00:02:38.290> would

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
natural process like with there would

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.460 
natural process like with there would
there<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:38.950> two<00:02:39.340> different<00:02:39.760> groups<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:41.340> natural

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
there be two different groups of natural
