what happened was there was a crack in
the<00:00:39.059> plane<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.100> led<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.670> loss<00:00:41.969> of

the plane and that this led to a loss of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
the plane and that this led to a loss of
oxygen<00:00:42.450> feel<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.800> pilot<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.340> be

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
oxygen feel like the pilot would be

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
oxygen feel like the pilot would be
drunk<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.950> intoxicated<00:00:46.950> state

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
from lack of oxygen and that this would

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
from lack of oxygen and that this would
happen<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.309> suddenly<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.940> explain<00:00:51.780> why

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
happen very suddenly and explain why

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
happen very suddenly and explain why
they<00:00:52.530> didn't<00:00:53.070> communicate<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:54.390> explains<00:00:54.870> some

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
they didn't communicate it explains some

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
of it but it doesn't explain all of it

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.420 
of it but it doesn't explain all of it
well<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> question<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.829> why<00:00:59.100> were

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
well there was a question of why were

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
well there was a question of why were
the<00:00:59.940> passengers<00:01:00.660> phones<00:01:01.050> ringing<00:01:01.590> normally

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the passengers phones ringing normally

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.950 
the passengers phones ringing normally
if<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> plane<00:01:03.120> your<00:01:03.600> phone's<00:01:03.809> not

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
if you're in a plane your phone's not

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
if you're in a plane your phone's not
supposed<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> work<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.280> it'd<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.670> why<00:01:06.140> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
supposed to work so it'd be like why is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070 
supposed to work so it'd be like why is
the<00:01:07.650> phone<00:01:07.830> even<00:01:08.040> ringing<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.570> may<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.810> be

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the phone even ringing it may just be

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
the phone even ringing it may just be
that<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.950> system<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.670> trying<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> route<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that the system was trying to route the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
that the system was trying to route the
call<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> phone<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.619> while<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.460> trying

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
call to the phone and while it's trying

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.100 
call to the phone and while it's trying
to<00:01:14.729> figure<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.030> where<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> send<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to figure out where you know to send the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
to figure out where you know to send the
call<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:17.369> there's<00:01:17.580> ringing<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
call that there's ringing in in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
call that there's ringing in in the
interim<00:01:18.990> even<00:01:19.320> though<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
interim even though it's not going to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.710 
interim even though it's not going to
connect<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
connect but it just has to do with the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990 
connect but it just has to do with the
way<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.110> connecting<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> system<00:01:23.670> trying

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
way it's connecting to the system trying

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
way it's connecting to the system trying
to<00:01:24.119> find<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.229> end<00:01:25.830> recipient<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to find the the end recipient of the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
to find the the end recipient of the
call<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.810> there's<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.290> time<00:01:28.560> where<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
call and so there's this time where it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
call and so there's this time where it
would<00:01:28.920> ring<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> doesn't<00:01:29.700> mean<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
would ring but it doesn't mean that the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
would ring but it doesn't mean that the
phone<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:31.259> anywhere<00:01:32.040> where<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
phone was actually anywhere where it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
phone was actually anywhere where it
could<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.909> really<00:01:33.329> connected<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.960> been

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
could have really connected or been

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
could have really connected or been
picked<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> question

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
picked up and then there was a question

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.649 
picked up and then there was a question
of<00:01:36.710> inaccurate<00:01:38.030> passenger<00:01:39.030> records<00:01:39.180> and

passports<00:01:49.320> had<00:01:49.470> been<00:01:49.619> stolen<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.149> guess

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
passports had been stolen so I guess

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.789 
passports had been stolen so I guess
this<00:01:51.600> could<00:01:51.780> happen<00:01:51.990> although<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.770> bit

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this could happen although it's a bit

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.370 
this could happen although it's a bit
weird<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:53.790> easy<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.360> seems<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.079> steal

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
weird how easy it seems to be to steal

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
weird how easy it seems to be to steal
people's<00:01:55.740> passports<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.090> take

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
people's passports and then just take

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.740 
people's passports and then just take
planes<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:58.670> CNN<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.060> address<00:02:00.540> as

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
planes with them CNN here address as

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.770 
planes with them CNN here address as
many<00:02:01.549> mysterious<00:02:02.549> things<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
many mysterious things about the the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.130 
many mysterious things about the the
flight<00:02:04.530> disappearing<00:02:05.430> plane<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
flight disappearing plane and and so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.540 
flight disappearing plane and and so
they<00:02:07.290> cover<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> different<00:02:08.489> things

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
they cover a lot of different things

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.699 
they cover a lot of different things
here<00:02:09.030> did<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.300> go<00:02:09.420> off<00:02:09.509> course<00:02:09.929> was<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
here did it go off course was it a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.440 
here did it go off course was it a
transponder<00:02:11.250> problem<00:02:11.849> did<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
transponder problem did it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.800 
transponder problem did it
why<00:02:12.660> did<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> stop<00:02:13.080> working<00:02:13.790> where's<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.060> data

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
why did it stop working where's the data

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.770 
why did it stop working where's the data
and<00:02:16.020> voice<00:02:16.170> recorders<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.599> lot<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.629> different

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and voice recorders a lot of different

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
and voice recorders a lot of different
things<00:02:19.230> could<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> pilot<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.519> flown<00:02:20.790> under

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
things could the pilot have flown under

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.680 
things could the pilot have flown under
the<00:02:21.239> radar<00:02:21.739> also<00:02:22.739> they<00:02:22.890> mentioned<00:02:23.540> could<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the radar also they mentioned could it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.330 
the radar also they mentioned could it
have<00:02:24.810> been<00:02:24.890> terrorism<00:02:25.890> could<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.280> been

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
have been terrorism could it have been

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.690 
have been terrorism could it have been
hijacked<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.830> know<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.099> make<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.459> case

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
hijacked and you know they make the case

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
hijacked and you know they make the case
for<00:02:29.900> whatever<00:02:30.900> their<00:02:31.050> point<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.650> each<00:02:31.830> of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
for whatever their point is for each of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.339 
for whatever their point is for each of
these<00:02:32.069> individual<00:02:32.760> things<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:34.050> guess<00:02:34.200> if

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
these individual things and I guess if

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.690 
these individual things and I guess if
you<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:34.620> read<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.130> could<00:02:35.250> say<00:02:35.459> well

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you just read this you could say well

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
you just read this you could say well
you<00:02:36.000> know<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.330> could<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.349> plane<00:02:37.590> just

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you know it could be that the plane just

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550 
you know it could be that the plane just
just<00:02:38.700> disappeared<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.440> in

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
just disappeared and you know it's in

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.870 
just disappeared and you know it's in
the<00:02:40.650> ocean<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:43.160> that's<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.640> really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
the ocean and that's it it was really

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.030 
the ocean and that's it it was really
just<00:02:45.000> an<00:02:45.209> accident<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> failure

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
just an accident like a failure

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.949 
just an accident like a failure
equipment<00:02:47.790> failure<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.420> something<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.900> that

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
equipment failure or something like that

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 
equipment failure or something like that
and<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.370> could<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.549> sort<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.849> want<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.180> leave

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and you could just sort of want to leave

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.970 
and you could just sort of want to leave
it<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.049> yet<00:02:52.290> then<00:02:52.500> there's<00:02:52.709> other

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
it at that and yet then there's other

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.729 
it at that and yet then there's other
stuff<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:53.780> weird<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.079> shows<00:02:55.560> that

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
stuff that's weird and shows that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.770 
stuff that's weird and shows that
there's<00:02:55.950> even<00:02:56.040> more<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:57.329> really<00:02:57.630> not

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
there's even more that has really not

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.720 
there's even more that has really not
been<00:02:57.810> explained<00:02:58.410> about<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.430> happened<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
been explained about what happened to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270 
been explained about what happened to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the plane such as this six important

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.830 
the plane such as this six important
facts<00:03:02.549> are<00:03:02.670> not<00:03:02.760> being<00:03:03.030> told<00:03:03.269> about<00:03:03.450> lost

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.690 
Malaysia Airlines flight 370 according
to<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.989> all<00:03:07.260> black<00:03:07.530> box<00:03:07.799> recorders<00:03:08.220> transmit

to this all black box recorders transmit

locator signals for at least 30 days

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.860 
locator signals for at least 30 days
after<00:03:11.220> falling<00:03:11.430> into<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.790> ocean<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.720> they

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
after falling into the ocean so they

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.569 
after falling into the ocean so they
should<00:03:13.079> at<00:03:13.200> least<00:03:13.380> be<00:03:13.739> able<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:14.190> figure<00:03:14.430> out

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
should at least be able to figure out

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.550 
should at least be able to figure out
where<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.500> black<00:03:16.769> box<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:18.319> a<00:03:19.319> missile

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
where the the black box is if a missile

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.400 
where the the black box is if a missile
destroyed<00:03:20.310> flight<00:03:20.810> 370<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> missile<00:03:22.260> would

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
destroyed flight 370 the missile would

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.979 
destroyed flight 370 the missile would
have<00:03:22.500> left<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.889> radar<00:03:23.220> signature<00:03:23.760> good<00:03:24.690> point

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
have left a radar signature good point

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.920 
have left a radar signature good point
so<00:03:25.350> probably<00:03:25.859> wasn't<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.160> missile<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.930> don't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
so probably wasn't the missile I don't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.090 
so probably wasn't the missile I don't
think<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.139> was<00:03:28.200> terrorism<00:03:28.560> either<00:03:28.920> doesn't

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
think it was terrorism either doesn't

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.520 
think it was terrorism either doesn't
make<00:03:29.250> any<00:03:29.400> sense<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.720> location<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
make any sense the location of the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.349 
make any sense the location of the
aircraft<00:03:32.069> when<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.489> vanished<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.120> not<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
aircraft when it vanished is not a

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.340 
aircraft when it vanished is not a
mystery<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.799> they<00:03:35.480> know<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.510> location

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
mystery so they know the location

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.340 
mystery so they know the location
elevation<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.190> airspeed<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:40.109> why<00:03:40.290> are

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
elevation and airspeed so then why are

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.990 
elevation and airspeed so then why are
they<00:03:40.530> discussing<00:03:41.069> whether<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.700> guy<00:03:41.790> could

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
they discussing whether the guy could

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460 
they discussing whether the guy could
have<00:03:42.090> flown<00:03:42.269> under<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.569> radar<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.079> mean<00:03:43.350> if

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
have flown under the radar I mean if

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.710 
have flown under the radar I mean if
they<00:03:43.590> know<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.010> elevation<00:03:44.970> then<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:45.540> should

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
they know the elevation then they should

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.210 
they know the elevation then they should
already<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.260> answer<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.799> question

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
already have the answer that question

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.319 
already have the answer that question
they<00:03:48.150> did<00:03:48.359> their<00:03:48.600> air<00:03:49.230> safety<00:03:49.530> investigators

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
they did their air safety investigators

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.300 
they did their air safety investigators
have<00:03:51.329> seen<00:03:51.600> midair<00:03:51.959> explosions<00:03:52.530> before<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
have seen midair explosions before and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.259 
have seen midair explosions before and
they<00:03:53.519> would<00:03:53.670> know<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> difference<00:03:53.940> between

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
they would know the difference between

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.870 
they would know the difference between
up<00:03:55.079> playing<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.650> exploded<00:03:56.250> or<00:03:56.400> vanished

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
up playing that exploded or vanished

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.069 
up playing that exploded or vanished
makes<00:03:57.810> sense<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.230> me<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.720> flight<00:04:00.930> was

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
makes sense to me if the flight was

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780 
makes sense to me if the flight was
hijacked<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.709> would<00:04:01.859> not<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.250> vanished<00:04:02.639> from

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
hijacked it would not have vanished from

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.569 
hijacked it would not have vanished from
the<00:04:02.970> radar<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.799> think<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:04.920> pretty<00:04:05.069> clear<00:04:05.310> it

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
the radar I think it's pretty clear it

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.580 
the radar I think it's pretty clear it
didn't<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.060> didn't<00:04:06.269> get<00:04:06.329> hijacked<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:07.440> they

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
didn't it didn't get hijacked so they

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.589 
didn't it didn't get hijacked so they
say<00:04:07.829> conclusion<00:04:08.430> flight<00:04:08.669> 370<00:04:09.269> did<00:04:09.419> not

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
say conclusion flight 370 did not

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.780 
say conclusion flight 370 did not
explode<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.290> vanished<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.459> there's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
explode it vanished I think that there's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.610 
explode it vanished I think that there's
a<00:04:11.849> possibility<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.630> what<00:04:13.169> we're<00:04:13.319> dealing

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
a possibility that what we're dealing

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.580 
a possibility that what we're dealing
with<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.609> twilight<00:04:15.450> zone<00:04:15.780> type<00:04:16.289> of

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
with here is a twilight zone type of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.839 
with here is a twilight zone type of
phenomena<00:04:17.310> where<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:19.560> know<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:20.430> could<00:04:20.729> have

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
phenomena where you know it could have

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.550 
phenomena where you know it could have
been<00:04:20.909> abducted<00:04:21.419> by<00:04:21.450> aliens<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:22.320> could<00:04:22.470> have

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
been abducted by aliens it could have

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.090 
been abducted by aliens it could have
been<00:04:22.650> hit<00:04:22.890> by<00:04:23.099> a<00:04:23.130> directed

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
been hit by a directed

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.530 
been hit by a directed
energy<00:04:24.340> weapon<00:04:26.730> it's<00:04:27.730> something<00:04:28.090> really<00:04:28.300> out

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
energy weapon it's something really out

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.870 
energy weapon it's something really out
of<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.750> ordinary<00:04:28.860> maybe<00:04:29.860> there<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.460> pyramid

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
of the ordinary maybe there is a pyramid

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.270 
of the ordinary maybe there is a pyramid
down<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.960> bottom<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.500> ocean<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:33.130> in

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
down in the bottom of the ocean like in

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.730 
down in the bottom of the ocean like in
the<00:04:33.310> Bermuda<00:04:33.730> Triangle<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.420> that<00:04:35.140> sucked<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
the Bermuda Triangle and that sucked the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.730 
the Bermuda Triangle and that sucked the
plane<00:04:35.950> down<00:04:36.130> hey<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.360> they<00:04:38.080> recently<00:04:38.410> found<00:04:38.650> a

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
plane down hey I they recently found a

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.140 
plane down hey I they recently found a
pyramid<00:04:39.070> at<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.250> bottom<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.970> Bermuda

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
pyramid at the bottom of the Bermuda

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.740 
pyramid at the bottom of the Bermuda
Triangle<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.020> that's<00:04:41.590> why<00:04:41.950> all<00:04:42.450> these<00:04:43.450> planes

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
Triangle and that's why all these planes

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.880 
Triangle and that's why all these planes
and<00:04:43.930> things<00:04:44.080> have<00:04:44.200> been<00:04:44.290> getting<00:04:44.380> sucked<00:04:44.770> down

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
and things have been getting sucked down

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.310 
and things have been getting sucked down
in<00:04:45.130> there<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.460> maybe<00:04:45.850> they<00:04:46.690> should<00:04:46.900> be<00:04:47.020> looking

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
in there so maybe they should be looking

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.310 
in there so maybe they should be looking
for<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.560> pyramid<00:04:48.450> instead<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.720> black<00:04:49.930> box

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
for a pyramid instead of the black box

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.270 
for a pyramid instead of the black box
oh<00:04:50.770> wait<00:04:51.600> snopes<00:04:52.600> says<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.830> whole<00:04:53.980> rumor

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
oh wait snopes says this whole rumor

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.820 
oh wait snopes says this whole rumor
about<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.550> crystal<00:04:54.790> pyramid<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.570> false<00:04:55.900> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
about the crystal pyramid is false the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.860 
about the crystal pyramid is false the
researcher<00:04:57.550> who<00:04:57.940> claims<00:04:58.300> have<00:04:58.480> found<00:04:58.690> it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
researcher who claims have found it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.110 
researcher who claims have found it
could<00:04:59.260> never<00:04:59.410> prove<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.770> because<00:05:00.010> he<00:05:00.880> had<00:05:01.090> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
could never prove it because he had the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.580 
could never prove it because he had the
pictures<00:05:01.540> because<00:05:01.960> they<00:05:02.170> were<00:05:02.230> supposedly

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
pictures because they were supposedly

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.500 
pictures because they were supposedly
destroyed<00:05:02.920> which<00:05:03.550> she<00:05:03.790> has<00:05:03.940> no<00:05:04.180> proof<00:05:04.360> of

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
destroyed which she has no proof of

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.910 
destroyed which she has no proof of
either<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.110> so<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.470> whole<00:05:05.590> thing<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:05.890> a

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
either and so the whole thing is a

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.890 
either and so the whole thing is a
conspiracy<00:05:06.280> theory<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:07.000> hoax<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.420> should

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
conspiracy theory in a hoax and should

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.260 
conspiracy theory in a hoax and should
not<00:05:08.020> be<00:05:08.080> believed<00:05:08.560> but<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.460> course<00:05:09.700> if<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.150> if

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
not be believed but of course if it if

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.710 
not be believed but of course if it if
it<00:05:10.360> really<00:05:10.630> had<00:05:10.810> happened<00:05:12.390> his<00:05:13.390> pictures

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
it really had happened his pictures

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
it really had happened his pictures
probably<00:05:13.870> would<00:05:14.140> have<00:05:14.200> been<00:05:14.260> destroyed

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
probably would have been destroyed

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.890 
probably would have been destroyed
because<00:05:14.920> the<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:16.000> people<00:05:16.150> who<00:05:16.450> maintain

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
because the the the people who maintain

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.510 
because the the the people who maintain
the<00:05:17.260> order<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.590> things<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.130> status<00:05:18.400> quo

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
the order of things and the status quo

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.710 
the order of things and the status quo
would<00:05:18.700> not<00:05:18.850> want<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.240> kind<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.510> information

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
would not want this kind of information

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.250 
would not want this kind of information
to<00:05:20.020> get<00:05:20.140> out<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:20.890> this<00:05:21.730> proves<00:05:22.570> nothing<00:05:22.810> and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
to get out so this proves nothing and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.800 
to get out so this proves nothing and
who<00:05:23.500> is<00:05:23.650> snopes<00:05:23.920> anyway<00:05:24.510> probably<00:05:25.510> just

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
who is snopes anyway probably just

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.280 
who is snopes anyway probably just
another<00:05:27.090> psychological<00:05:28.090> operations<00:05:28.840> disinfo

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
another psychological operations disinfo

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.420 
another psychological operations disinfo
site<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:31.530> they<00:05:32.530> should<00:05:32.680> still<00:05:32.890> be<00:05:33.040> looking<00:05:33.310> for

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
site so they should still be looking for

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.680 
site so they should still be looking for
the<00:05:33.520> pyramid<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:36.280> seems<00:05:36.580> like<00:05:36.730> those<00:05:37.420> things

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
the pyramid it seems like those things

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.170 
the pyramid it seems like those things
actually<00:05:37.870> make<00:05:38.200> more<00:05:38.410> sense<00:05:38.710> than<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:40.090> know

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
actually make more sense than you know

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.830 
actually make more sense than you know

for it to be explainable in a normal way
of<00:05:49.150> course<00:05:49.630> maybe<00:05:50.050> there's<00:05:50.260> just<00:05:50.440> something

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
of course maybe there's just something

out that there was a more kind of normal
explanation<00:05:56.530> for<00:05:57.070> it<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.340> not<00:05:57.940> supernatural

in<00:06:34.840> and<00:06:35.080> realize<00:06:35.260> when<00:06:35.620> there's<00:06:35.770> something

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
in and realize when there's something

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.870 
in and realize when there's something
askew<00:06:36.640> but<00:06:36.700> they'll<00:06:36.970> just<00:06:37.150> go<00:06:37.300> straight<00:06:37.570> to

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
askew but they'll just go straight to

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.640 
askew but they'll just go straight to
like<00:06:38.060> none<00:06:38.210> of<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.420> ever<00:06:38.450> happened<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:39.260> it

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
like none of it ever happened and it

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.130 
like none of it ever happened and it
makes<00:06:39.830> everybody<00:06:40.040> look<00:06:40.220> crazy<00:06:40.520> I<00:06:41.140> really

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
makes everybody look crazy I really

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.690 
makes everybody look crazy I really
think<00:06:42.320> that<00:06:42.590> this<00:06:42.680> kind<00:06:42.890> of<00:06:42.980> stuff<00:06:43.190> is<00:06:43.310> planted

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
think that this kind of stuff is planted

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.020 
think that this kind of stuff is planted
in<00:06:43.790> there<00:06:44.000> it's<00:06:44.150> just<00:06:44.300> to<00:06:44.420> completely<00:06:45.260> destroy

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
in there it's just to completely destroy

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.290 
in there it's just to completely destroy
the<00:06:47.030> alternative<00:06:47.780> media<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.790> truth

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
the alternative media and the truth

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.990 
the alternative media and the truth
seekers<00:06:50.660> activist<00:06:51.320> community<00:06:51.410> and<00:06:51.950> and<00:06:52.730> so

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
seekers activist community and and so

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.490 
seekers activist community and and so
far<00:06:53.180> they<00:06:53.330> seem<00:06:53.510> to<00:06:53.540> have<00:06:53.690> been<00:06:53.930> doing<00:06:54.200> a<00:06:54.320> good

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
far they seem to have been doing a good

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.760 
far they seem to have been doing a good
job<00:06:54.560> with<00:06:54.920> that<00:06:54.980> and<00:06:55.540> so<00:06:56.540> I<00:06:56.570> would<00:06:57.260> not<00:06:57.620> even

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
job with that and so I would not even

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.710 
job with that and so I would not even
entertain<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:58.430> idea<00:06:58.700> that<00:06:59.030> this<00:06:59.390> didn't

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
entertain the idea that this didn't

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.770 
entertain the idea that this didn't
happen<00:06:59.870> I<00:07:00.230> think<00:07:01.040> probably<00:07:01.700> did<00:07:02.120> happen<00:07:02.270> and

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780 
happen I think probably did happen and

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.810 
happen I think probably did happen and
it's<00:07:03.320> just<00:07:03.650> something<00:07:03.980> very<00:07:04.280> strange<00:07:04.520> that

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
it's just something very strange that

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.230 
it's just something very strange that
happened<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:05.510> I<00:07:06.440> hope<00:07:06.770> that<00:07:06.800> eventually

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
happened and I hope that eventually

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.630 
happened and I hope that eventually
there's<00:07:08.240> an<00:07:08.450> explanation<00:07:08.690> because<00:07:09.460> it<00:07:10.460> must

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
there's an explanation because it must

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.850 
there's an explanation because it must
be<00:07:10.820> really<00:07:10.910> hard<00:07:11.060> for<00:07:11.270> those<00:07:11.510> families<00:07:11.750> to<00:07:12.260> to

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
be really hard for those families to to

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.220 
be really hard for those families to to
not<00:07:13.070> have<00:07:13.250> any<00:07:13.370> kind<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.700> closure<00:07:14.020> so<00:07:15.020> let<00:07:15.200> me
