obviously it's like I think a quarter
more<00:02:12.420> than<00:02:12.510> any<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:12.780> method<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.500> like

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
more than any other method and it's like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.900 
more than any other method and it's like
the<00:02:13.770> same<00:02:13.950> XP<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.580> all<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> other

the same XP is like all the other
methods<00:02:15.270> besides<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.110> royalty<00:02:16.560> high<00:02:16.740> tops

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
methods besides like royalty high tops

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
methods besides like royalty high tops
and<00:02:17.550> stuff<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:17.910> um<00:02:18.270> yeah<00:02:19.200> royal<00:02:19.440> yeah

role of the high top that's fight that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
role of the high top that's fight that
sounds<00:02:21.300> weird<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> never<00:02:22.380> crapped

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
sounds weird because I I never crapped

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
sounds weird because I I never crapped
it<00:02:22.890> when<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.070> was<00:02:23.190> world<00:02:23.370> d<00:02:23.520> high<00:02:23.640> tops<00:02:23.940> out

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it when there was world d high tops out

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
it when there was world d high tops out
but<00:02:24.480> yeah<00:02:25.200> those<00:02:25.350> are<00:02:25.470> obviously<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.800> best

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
but yeah those are obviously the best

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.850 
but yeah those are obviously the best
experience<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> hitfix<00:02:27.030> p-gp<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.470> 30

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
experience but I hitfix p-gp is like 30

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.010 
experience but I hitfix p-gp is like 30
or<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.460> think<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:29.910> air<00:02:30.150> battle<00:02:30.540> staffs<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
or so I think for air battle staffs I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.930 
or so I think for air battle staffs I
didn't<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.380> legit<00:02:31.680> thing<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.310> think

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
didn't do the legit thing I know I think

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.730 
didn't do the legit thing I know I think
they're<00:02:33.090> about<00:02:33.240> stash<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.840> five<00:02:34.140> GP<00:02:34.590> or

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
they're about stash is like five GP or

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.490 
they're about stash is like five GP or
six<00:02:35.040> um<00:02:35.250> no<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.210> think<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:36.990> that's<00:02:37.200> more

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
six um no I think that's not that's more

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.920 
six um no I think that's not that's more
now<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.880> good<00:02:39.090> thing<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.720> make

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
now but one good thing is I if you make

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.170 
now but one good thing is I if you make
water<00:02:40.200> orbs<00:02:40.710> or<00:02:40.890> water<00:02:41.130> battle<00:02:41.670> scoffs<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
water orbs or water battle scoffs I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.270 
water orbs or water battle scoffs I
believe<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.720> five<00:02:42.990> or<00:02:43.230> four<00:02:43.440> GP<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:43.950> XP

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
believe it's like five or four GP and XP

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.760 
believe it's like five or four GP and XP
it's<00:02:44.700> 100<00:02:45.030> experience<00:02:45.420> /<00:02:45.600> staff<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.140> 30,000

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
it's 100 experience / staff so 30,000

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.400 
it's 100 experience / staff so 30,000
staffs<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.750> three<00:02:48.750> million<00:02:48.930> crafting

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
staffs is like three million crafting

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220 
staffs is like three million crafting
experience<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.340> 15<00:02:50.760> mil<00:02:51.030> versus<00:02:51.840> paying

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
experience for like 15 mil versus paying

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.260 
experience for like 15 mil versus paying
probably<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> hundred<00:02:53.640> mil<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> by

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
probably over a hundred mil for it by

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.780 
probably over a hundred mil for it by
now<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.780> quite<00:02:55.110> damn<00:02:55.410> expensive<00:02:55.680> um<00:02:56.250> i

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.019 
things are so anyways here is my current
six<00:06:14.440> hour<00:06:14.590> long<00:06:14.919> it's<00:06:15.159> this<00:06:15.310> with<00:06:15.460> five<00:06:15.699> hours

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
six hour long it's this with five hours

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.860 
six hour long it's this with five hours
43<00:06:16.210> minutes<00:06:16.419> um<00:06:16.840> so<00:06:17.710> i<00:06:18.039> went<00:06:18.279> from<00:06:18.479> six<00:06:19.479> million

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
43 minutes um so i went from six million

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.899 
43 minutes um so i went from six million
nine<00:06:20.050> hundred<00:06:20.080> seventy<00:06:20.889> nine<00:06:21.009> thousand<00:06:21.669> with

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
nine hundred seventy nine thousand with

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.700 
nine hundred seventy nine thousand with
that<00:06:22.150> much<00:06:22.360> hunter<00:06:22.870> now<00:06:23.110> let's<00:06:23.319> see<00:06:23.560> the

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
that much hunter now let's see the

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.499 
that much hunter now let's see the
difference<00:06:24.340> so<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.669> hunter<00:06:25.000> should<00:06:25.210> both<00:06:25.389> the

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
difference so the hunter should both the

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.350 
difference so the hunter should both the
36<00:06:25.990> points<00:06:26.490> it's<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.550> little<00:06:27.759> over<00:06:27.940> 1<00:06:28.120> million

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
36 points it's a little over 1 million

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.439 
36 points it's a little over 1 million
hunter<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:29.370> i'll<00:06:30.370> calculate<00:06:30.759> that<00:06:31.149> it<00:06:31.300> gets<00:06:31.389> a

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
hunter and i'll calculate that it gets a

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.990 
hunter and i'll calculate that it gets a
lil<00:06:31.539> bit<00:06:31.630> over<00:06:31.810> 150k<00:06:32.880> definition<00:06:33.880> which

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
lil bit over 150k definition which

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.180 
lil bit over 150k definition which
pretty<00:06:34.300> sexy<00:06:34.719> so<00:06:35.289> guys<00:06:35.500> are<00:06:35.740> averages<00:06:36.039> out<00:06:36.130> to

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
pretty sexy so guys are averages out to

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.690 
pretty sexy so guys are averages out to
be<00:06:36.399> some

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700
