00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 I wonder what's in the myths of local Indians 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.770
 there is a legend of the deities who came 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 nowhere in one of them mentioned 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.280
 goddess i'm ariana she suddenly appeared in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.570
 the sky on glittering gold discs and 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.020
 landed on the island the sun in the center 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.449
 lake titicaca goddess was different from 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.359
 she had four people in her arms 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.430
 fingers of ariana telepaths connected 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 bore on the island 70 children 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.000
 later founded our civilization and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.000
 gone again 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.640
 on the lake in the holy city 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 tiahuanaco stands strange arch gate 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.430
 the sun 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.430
 no one knows why they are needed 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 it is not the architectural construction is 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.810
 vertical granite rock here 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.860
 processed in such a way that it looks like 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.230
 on the portal or the gate that is I will turn out 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 lined surface size Cliffs 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.370
 about 7 by 7 meters on both sides 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.140
 vertically go in depth by half a meter 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.560
 semicircular gutters and in the center below 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 located 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.210
 as if less or a drill and that's according 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 local legend 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.740
 in this place in very ancient times 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.780
 there was a city of gods 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.790
 although here comes fathers 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.240
 our expedition is the area we know what 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.610
 no serious arch arctic 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.950
 no buildings were found there either 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.530
 unknown there necropolis in the nearest 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.110
 the vicinity of amara measure that is it 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.909
 in fact, a detached rock with 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 so here 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.580
 the gates 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.380
 in 2000 italian archaeologists at the bottom 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.540
 lakes really found the remains 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.570
 ancient city which is no less 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.890
 one and a half thousand years and still later scientists 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 learned one legends 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.229
 according to her in the years of the conquest supreme 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 the priest of the temple of the seven rays named Amara 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.430
 measure fled from the spanish soldiers on 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.040
 shores of lake titicaca 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.150
 with him he took the golden desing 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.009
 which was the key to the ancient watts 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.760
 after the rite of amara measure 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.340
 opened the gate and went into the world of the gods leaving 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.090
 the gold disc is deposited to local residents 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.750
 according to an ancient local legend, this is the gate to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.709
 world of gods 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.640
 here in which great heroes they went 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.430
 left the earth 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 went to the world of gods and sometimes some 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.209
 from them came back to 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:38.760
 inspect how things are going 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:41.550
 the world the current moment was later recorded 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.269
 another legend of the Inca and later 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.299
 according to this legend in the period of the conquest 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.450
 same early 16th century 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.209
 High priest 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.560
 the solar temple of the seven rays of amara measure 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.330
 fled from the Spanish soldiers NATO sacred 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.599
 Ancestral homeland on the shores of the lake 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.780
 strictly speaking by his name and named 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.360
 this monument and he took with him 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.300
 gold disk which is actually 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.760
 was the key to this gate according to 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.430
 the legend of Amara world gathered local priests 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.819
 and organized with them 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.340
 joint opening ceremony glad 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.230
 did you have this golden disk if you believe 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.890
 tales he give you answers to all 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.110
 questions 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.489
 then he had to be a 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.519
 some device with a large volume 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.500
 Information can also be assumed that 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.500
 the disc could only create a very 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.590
 highly developed civilization they their 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 a little intervene and direct this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.530
 a process that allowed them to move from 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.170
 one dimension to another under the memory of 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.349
 such transitions and it is preserved in 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.730
 Indian texts in particular Peruvian 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.920
 and marian indians and they remembered that 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.049
 it's somehow always associated with 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.450
 some kind of gia faults some 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.720
 special energy saturated zones 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.959
 therefore the appearance of the gate is exactly 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.350
 lobster mu is associated with such a place and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.850
 it is a symbol of what nature possesses 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.829
 such a phenomenon 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.019
 you just need to know when and where 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.120
 therefore the place was not chosen randomly 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.190
 if you know any more 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.850
 certain cycle energy moment 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.500
 then in this place may occur 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.680
 the curious effect of communicating with the gods 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.349
 the transition can be done for a friend and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.039
 space time but here should 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:40.750
 help a higher level civilization 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.880
 development now for transition to another 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.300
 measurement exactly in this place 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.150
 need a very powerful almost anomalous 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.450
 energy release in this place 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.840
 what can happen but it happens 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.300
 extremely rare key to the mystery 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.700
 gold disc priestess according to experts 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.590
 is a spiral most ancient symbol 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.140
 which is found on all continents 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.390
 the planets 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.130
 beginning with the Paleolithic monuments of many 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.580
 ancient civilizations spiral was 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.170
 symbol of the connection of heaven and earth 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.080
 the spiral emblem denoted some 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.990
 stars scientists have established that this symbol 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.000
 long used to write 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.520
 astronomical information in two 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.820
 spiral maze it is significant 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.160
 least 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.860
 symbolically reflects the movement of the sun 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:37.420
 six months ascending from winter to summer 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.800
 solstices and half a year descending when 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.630
 midday height 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.880
 lower and lower spiral turns more 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.800
 due to the fact that 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.550
 Sunrises scatter from the north to 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.580
 south and south to north in the center of the maze 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.220
 by spiral these spirals converge 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.650
 together and get a sign very 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.980
 yin-yang-like sign 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.980
 zodiacal cancer
