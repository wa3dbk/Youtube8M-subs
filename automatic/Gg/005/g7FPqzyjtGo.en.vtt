00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.069
 very good girls very good boy would be 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.010
 printed we are in a new news and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 is that the chief of communication of th q 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 a company that is currently in 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.519
 bankruptcy has spoken and said that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 believes that the call of duty has eliminated what 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.880
 I did what made the genre great 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.769
 fps the truth is that he came in a boss 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.929
 communications of th that has spoken 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 recently about the current situation 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.120
 of the shooters genre at first 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.250
 person that I think so much has 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 overexploited in this generation has 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.769
 been however the genre bomb of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 genus that has sold more millions of 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.890
 videogames in this generation and that has 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.019
 had an exponential growth because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 he has commented that there are tendencies 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.629
 that are defined by the public and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 the media and its success 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.020
 depends to the extent of us not of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.240
 the players 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.360
 and logically this has been tried 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.430
 copy the communications head says 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.320
 that can not talk about far cry or hitman 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.510
 because he has not played them personally 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.370
 but he says yes he has been able to play 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 additional et and who has enjoyed it 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.530
 very much and that particularly 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 Glad your call of duty success has 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 commented that he has defined the genre 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 erasing from players' memory 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 games so mythical and that should 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
 have played it because there are many people 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.940
 young today who has not played 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.110
 half of life for forgiveness and half life 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:41.160
 system shock or golden age and really and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.810
 truly, I particularly 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.720
 young people who have not played these 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.570
 games have life and this type of games 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.370
 that I tried it to prove it because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.979
 you are really losing a game that 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.400
 it's worth it's his years but he has 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.120
 good quality 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.670
 says the communications chief that I do not know 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.240
 you need military equipment in these 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.240
 games in hub light system shock the goal 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.740
 dni and that what they were trying to do 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.290
 they created these games was a world 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.210
 fantastic and that no weapons were needed 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 it's worth bioshock or souls as a base point 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.500
 ok bioshock infinite think that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.370
 he is also doing something totally 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.410
 different wants to do something different 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 just like the next subway game that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 has elements of stealth and gives the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.270
 feeling of being completely alone 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.570
 well, in part, I think that the boss 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.260
 of communications that's right now 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.459
 that there are mythical games that try to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.800
 you have to try them 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.440
 for example the bioshock saga is a game 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.350
 you have to try it you have to play 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.550
 the first because the same game by 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.540
 gross to me gave me that feeling 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.790
 abducts you inside is how you are part 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.460
 of history and this is a sensation 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.960
 that for example the bioshock is one of 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.760
 the few video games that has 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.800
 transmitted that to me is 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.930
 very important and is already losing 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.220
 this essence of video games that 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.140
 the same game gives you something you do not know 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.480
 imply this in the story and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.060
 truly few games nowadays 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.440
 I think I give you that feeling and that's what 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.140
 you produce and that's what 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.240
 truly makes a game really 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.730
 good and now if it exists if sharing is 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.680
 my opinion but I want as always 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.140
 in the description you tell me why 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
 for us it is very important that we 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.000
 give your opinion and that you comment on 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.310
 all your videos are worth more than 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.540
 the likes and above all else 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.660
 important to us is that we 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.040
 comment you give us your opinion and that 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.660
 because we want to know the truth is what 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.540
 good about this so nothing guys anymore 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.440
 you know like and favorites and see you in 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.440
