00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.500
 good friends of youtube today I come to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.680
 show how to put mods to vice gta 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.440
 city so we can get cars without 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.470
 need to get into Hayward or 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.700
 to be able to take out the cars the tricks 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.250
 no need to walk is to cover them 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.280
 or change up people's good that's 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.660
 very easy, we just have to climb 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.630
 a program and good 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 give it and the video subscribe 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.940
 and we go with the procedure 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.140
 good friends once you have 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.360
 the good we are going we are going to install the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.870
 mods for the gta vice city you will 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.000
 put here is the play store 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.550
 and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 and can join applications so that 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.840
 can grab us a little faster 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.229
 we can in the magnifying glass as it appears here 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 I read mods so they do not put it on me 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:29.490
 cleo musket abc yes and we go down 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.310
 here where cleo bc says we press it and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 you install in this if it's good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.050
 but also because I use the other not the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 that golf something like golf something like that and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.740
 well now they enter the application that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 the downloaded one arrives for example is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 in my case it 's beauty they say gta says 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.410
 bc 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.170
 you are not going to do this this I 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.300
 I'm going to remove because I already have 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 not done but I want you to see it 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.670
 the procedure step by step then 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.800
 we're going to erase all this because I already 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.149
 I did not but I want you to see that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.869
 if they work from scratch 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.869
 good 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.250
 well now they put him here where he says that 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.410
 yes they are going to do it you put it ok 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.590
 and a warning did not come out then it comes to 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.660
 install and will start loading about 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.000
 maps the mods that are what we are 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 installing in this case are four 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 but let's finish loading 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.270
 cleo golf until I finished circle 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.610
 awards route until then we can 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.290
 do the next step do not go to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.510
 to do crazy because something is going to come out 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.150
 bad and it can not work 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.040
 well these procedures are very 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.099
 simple easy believe that when I 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.049
 I saw them I said that absurd not so much 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.290
 I was struggling to make it just 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.319
 that but good as they were installed 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.120
 we put it in install scripts we are going to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.819
 install the reader without being chips 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.739
 those only two if you without installing 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.670
 the other two bikes in which I think that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.580
 it's about weapons and life but I do not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.950
 with these two is enough we are going to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.379
 put the last one if you are just like me 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.440
 do not grab them the whole screen press 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.959
 read and to do so and we leave 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.640
 open that we're going to leave it open and 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.690
 then do not put the one that is vice city 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.900
 good friends 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.430
 to do this let's see how you can see 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.850
 here it is already working very well 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.090
 mode 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.879
 It works pretty well 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.400
 the world runs me well let's grab 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.280
 that car and how are we going to get those 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 modest cars you collect here 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.400
 they make it down if you can see 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.800
 we get the option of cars or the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.760
 tricks I will put the tricks 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.650
 and there appear to me some 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.799
 let's put this one that I think is the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 weapon infinite ammunition but apparently 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.170
 not all are without infinite ammunition 2 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.590
 where no 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.569
 but Carlos Pauner 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.569
 let's put another 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:28.939
 it seems the next the screen 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.879
 and as you can see it did not come out and well 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.499
 friends that has been all this has them 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.270

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:40.300
 subscribe I did not want to be so long this 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.219
 video so you'll know that 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.680
 they do the whole procedure as 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.979
 I told them and they press here from above 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.639
 down so not that we did not have 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.639
 do it but good 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.389

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.230
 I do not know if you did not like it and good until the 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.230
 next
