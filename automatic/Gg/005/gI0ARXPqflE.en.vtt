00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.550
 mail me I 'm coming but me and a half 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.599
 Alex, she's the one for that shit. 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.599
 it's that shit 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.300
 save save the most wanted guys that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 video here the explanation of the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.920
 restored paper if you did not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 presentation click here to watch 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.460
 because at last you watch a trick and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.809
 explanation about you in your 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.519
 presentation is very cool then 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.269
 I recommend that you watch here 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.320
 the presentation arrives of inflation and for 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.699
 the trick 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.609
 Good guys, let's go with the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.500
 explanation of restored paper magic 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.829
 You will actually need two 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.410
 sheets of paper that are the same or okay 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 very similar if it is not exactly the same 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.030
 Ok the one that is a bit advanced is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.070
 I used it to make the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 presentation I will not get another one anyway 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.039
 I do not need to, but at least I will have two 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.300
 roles that will make one of them go and get 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.679
 and will knead a ball will not suffer 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.539
 so much 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.520
 but it also does not leave very open yesterday 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.340
 a normal ball 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 the other did not make it normal to do 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 time to present will present this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.600
 way to ensure the ball that the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:46.590
 bring it right here keep the ball here 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.070
 only this way begins to tear the paper 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 around the ball taking care to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.439
 do not show this little ball right wrong 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.509
 here the way you see fit 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.840
 remembering that to be careful to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.369
 not show entire ball is tac 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.219
 here a role impact is that the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 torn paper held so it goes 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.769
 by advancing the torn paper until it 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.570
 or less in the shape of the ball and 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.560
 try to leave in the ball shape is 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.100
 back to the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.010
 the paper size is behind or at the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.959
 less or less the right size 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.859
 so here was torn paper on the front 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.910
 and here behind the ball with the paper and 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.000
 all right 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.849
 There you find a way to turn this around. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 will put the paper intact forward 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.709
 here ahead saw 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.690
 turned and then opened the paper and always 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.040
 hiding the ripped part back here 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 You're just opening it up this way. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.360
 I'm always hiding this part that goes 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.900
 holding her that attracts the best way 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.730
 possible right 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.659
 Looks back to the delivery operation and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.370
 you always open by ensuring 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.470
 ball here behind 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.560
 Okay, it's not just a little training. 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.019
 in front of the mirror to see if you do not 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.030
 is accidentally showing this 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.340
 ball that behind the ball intact 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.799
 ball torn at the end of the day 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.930
 Trick anyway, it 's just enough training. 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.620
 and I hope science does not pick up 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.480
 quickly 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.540
 good staff you could see this 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.069
 trick is cool because he can be 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.480
 done in virtually every place that 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.150
 you have so if you are in a bar 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.069
 with your friends at a diner in 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.950
 restaurant at school at work 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.739
 Any place you have is only you. 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.459
 two sheets of paper is exactly what you 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.440
 equals 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.750
 who for example is in the stone bar 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.690
 napkins abca two napkins to batter 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.930
 one ball and tear the other the other 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.730
 napkin anyway I think this is the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.069
 coolest of this truck 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.139
 a cool tip is the following is when I 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.400
 I finish this trick when I do the 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:10.849
 presentation the torn ball that is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.709
 behind the intact leaf 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.229
 I usually, for example, I'm 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.449
 of course 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.760
 I 'll get it later at first 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.770
 She gets rid of it by throwing it to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.039
 away or putting it in your pocket 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.080
 and then you can deliver the other sheet 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.940
 person because you're just holding 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.070
 showing how cool looking it has restored 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.560
 here the beauty paper does not have everything 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.780
 perfect then while people are 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.360
 there reacting at a single glance and will stay 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 we where I was, what you can 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.900
 do for example if the person did not take 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.729
 the eye of you to hide the paper 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.669
 say something and draw your attention to the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.300
 Your hand knows why you can by 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.490
 example 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.759
 For example, take the paper ball 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.710
 here behind the leaf and the leaf for her 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.710
 so we call attention to this hand 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.150
 here and with that hand you pick up the 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.759
 Epa stickball in your pocket and strip 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.220
 the attention of the hand that is the ball 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.069
 torn is relatively easy to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.599
 hide this little ball that lies behind 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.550
 So this is personal just to remember the 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.039
 I'm leaving here below in the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.430
 description a link for you to access 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.520
 online magic courses on the website of 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.669
 empire of the magic ok to these courses 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.479
 you can buy a full course or 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.669
 you can buy the spells of the course 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.620
 then both the full course and 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.580
 these single songs are priced well 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.620
 cool 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.000
 so you 're starting, do not have 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.699
 money to invest does not have that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.370
 money to buy a lot of product is that 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.379
 requires a slightly higher investment 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.710
 I think it's a good investment going 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.780
 create a legal repertoire already 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.360
 will be able to go out doing magic on the street 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.330
 for friends at last 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.219
 and then you in every course there you do 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.539
 exactly all the brands that have a 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.000
 course 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.680
 the description of them is the description of done 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.440
 a video with the presentation of all 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.120
 tricks is including some tricks there 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.029
 It's me I 'm introducing I'm 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.409
 teaching then I think it was one thing 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:18.930
 It's very cool for me to have this 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.569
 opportunity then I would really like 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.279
 you descend a conferred access to it 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.529
 also the partner channels here 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.349
 We wish we had a technology that 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.080
 will appear here has the israeli channel 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.569
 the illusionist will appear here also and 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.060
 the channel of the Portuguese daee is going 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.590
 appear here are three channels of 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.419
 friends of mine who also do magic 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.860
 and three very good channels I think the 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.870
 way you should have already accompanied 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.639
 they sure did not follow 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.740
 access to, it's worth it, you're going 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.949
 learn a lot of legal things from both 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.500
 concepts presentations as well as 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.090
 tricks like this and they will also 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.729
 fun enough that the videos are 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.590
 It's really fun for today, I'm just going to stay. 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.710
 around here 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.710
 we'll see each other in the next Czech video
