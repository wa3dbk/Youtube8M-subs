00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
really helps folks understand how to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.460 
really helps folks understand how to
combine<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.630> terms<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> can't

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
combine like terms what you can't

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500

of<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.840> three<00:00:28.289> kinds<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> note<00:00:28.920> cards<00:00:29.340> if

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
of me here three kinds of note cards if

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
of me here three kinds of note cards if
you<00:00:30.060> were<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> scramble<00:00:30.900> them<00:00:31.080> what<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> might

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you were to scramble them what you might

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.549 
you were to scramble them what you might
get<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> students<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.809> put<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
get the students to do is again put the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.430 
get the students to do is again put the
color<00:00:34.829> cards<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.110> match

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
color cards and so that they all match

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
color cards and so that they all match
for<00:00:37.920> example<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> orange<00:00:39.120> cards<00:00:39.480> go

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
for example have the orange cards go

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.150 
for example have the orange cards go
with<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> orange<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.500> green<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with the orange the green go with a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
with the orange the green go with a
green<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.059> pink<00:00:42.270> go<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> pink<00:00:44.180> have

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
green and the pink go with the pink have

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.520 
green and the pink go with the pink have
them<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.450> careful<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.289> interchange

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
them be careful of not to interchange

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
them be careful of not to interchange
the<00:00:46.800> different<00:00:47.100> colors<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.120> cards

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the different colors because the cards

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.310 
the different colors because the cards
are<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.719> alike

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
are not alike

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.110 
are not alike
that's<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.800> example<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.250> using<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.789> terms

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that's an example of using like terms

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.840 
that's an example of using like terms
and<00:00:51.329> having<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> game<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
and having a game with it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
and having a game with it
money<00:00:53.850> games<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.270> especially<00:00:54.780> effective

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
money games are especially effective

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.250 
money games are especially effective
because<00:00:55.699> just<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.789> everybody<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:58.050> relate

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
because just about everybody can relate

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.430 
because just about everybody can relate
to<00:00:58.320> money<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> great<00:01:00.059> tool<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.660> helping

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to money it's a great tool for helping

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280 
to money it's a great tool for helping
you<00:01:01.730> determine<00:01:02.730> addition<00:01:03.420> subtraction<00:01:03.960> as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you determine addition subtraction as

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.770 
you determine addition subtraction as
well<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.830> decimals<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.630> know

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
well as decimals because as you know

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.350 
well as decimals because as you know
money<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> dollar<00:01:07.860> bills<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> coins<00:01:08.790> use

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
money the dollar bills and the coins use

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560 
money the dollar bills and the coins use
a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> decimals<00:01:10.549> arithmetic<00:01:11.549> games<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a lot of decimals arithmetic games the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
a lot of decimals arithmetic games the
idea<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.770> pieces<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> paper

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
idea is if you take some pieces of paper

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
idea is if you take some pieces of paper
cut<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.600> might<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.020> two<00:01:16.680> groups<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
cut them up you might have two groups of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
cut them up you might have two groups of
paper<00:01:17.520> each<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.509> from<00:01:18.750> 0<00:01:19.049> through<00:01:19.320> 9

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
paper each have from 0 through 9

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
paper each have from 0 through 9
representing<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> ten<00:01:20.670> digits<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.780> two

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
representing the ten digits but have two

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.990 
representing the ten digits but have two
stacks<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> third

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
stacks because you're gonna have a third

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.260 
stacks because you're gonna have a third
stack<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:25.080> four<00:01:25.409> pieces<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> paper<00:01:26.270> each

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
stack with four pieces of paper each

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
stack with four pieces of paper each
involving<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.439> operation<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> addition

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
involving an operation one for addition

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
involving an operation one for addition
subtraction<00:01:30.509> multiplication<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:32.400> division

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
subtraction multiplication or division

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.359 
subtraction multiplication or division
and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.259> them<00:01:34.470> quick

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and then that way it can get them quick

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.450 
and then that way it can get them quick
ideas<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.110> mix-and-match<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.130> use

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
