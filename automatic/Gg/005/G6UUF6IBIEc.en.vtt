but we have an equal responsibility for
people<00:00:58.440> who<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.800> invested<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.399> us<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.480> we

people who have invested with us so we

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.429

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
is where our focus is on the other side

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
is where our focus is on the other side
because<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.460> need<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> investors

developing underdeveloped force I think

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.240 
developing underdeveloped force I think
we<00:02:04.560> need<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> develop<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.369> PPP<00:02:06.270> model<00:02:06.829> that

sixty six billion u.s. dollars seventy

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.810 
sixty six billion u.s. dollars seventy
percent<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.920> contribution<00:02:30.490> comes<00:02:30.760> from

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
percent of the contribution comes from

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.190 
percent of the contribution comes from
private<00:02:31.330> players<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:31.810> you

private players like you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.870 
private players like you
thirty<00:02:32.830> percent<00:02:33.070> comes<00:02:33.460> from<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> government

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
thirty percent comes from the government

thirty percent comes from the government
so<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.960> way<00:02:35.110> ahead<00:02:35.230> private<00:02:35.980> players

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
so is this the way ahead private players

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.100 
so is this the way ahead private players
are<00:02:36.430> going<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.670> really<00:02:36.880> change<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.630> way

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
are going to really change the way

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.080 
are going to really change the way
health<00:02:38.290> care<00:02:38.440> functions<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.340> country<00:02:39.640> i

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
health care functions in this country i

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.760 
health care functions in this country i
think<00:02:40.510> there<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:40.960> two<00:02:40.990> things<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.680> this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
think there are two things for this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.310 
think there are two things for this
number<00:02:42.280> one<00:02:42.460> i<00:02:42.490> think<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.940> government<00:02:43.320> spends

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
number one i think the government spends

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.190 
number one i think the government spends
only<00:02:44.470> 1%<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> GDP<00:02:45.720> towards<00:02:46.720> health<00:02:46.960> care

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
only 1% of the GDP towards health care

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.070 
only 1% of the GDP towards health care
we<00:02:47.980> need<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.370> know<00:02:48.580> where<00:02:48.820> as<00:02:49.060> u.s.<00:02:49.360> spends<00:02:49.660> 16

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
we need to know where as u.s. spends 16

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.400 
we need to know where as u.s. spends 16
fifty<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.920> 16<00:02:51.250> percent<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:51.760> more<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
fifty to 16 percent or more and the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.960 
fifty to 16 percent or more and the
europe<00:02:53.710> spends<00:02:54.100> close<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.550> eight<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.790> ten

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
europe spends close to eight to ten

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180 
europe spends close to eight to ten
percent<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.450> gdp<00:02:55.870> even<00:02:56.650> countries<00:02:57.160> like

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
percent of gdp even countries like

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.820 
percent of gdp even countries like
russia<00:02:58.000> brazil<00:02:58.450> they<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.200> spend<00:02:59.560> three<00:02:59.710> to

five percent of GDP for towards health

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.050 
five percent of GDP for towards health
care<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.080> that's<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.800> answer<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
care I think that's one answer in the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.420 
care I think that's one answer in the
second<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.110> twelfth<00:03:05.410> plan<00:03:05.650> they<00:03:06.340> have

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
second in this twelfth plan they have

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.450 
second in this twelfth plan they have
increased<00:03:06.820> substantially<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.130> from<00:03:09.310> 1

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
increased substantially that is from 1

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.300 
increased substantially that is from 1
percent<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.910> they're<00:03:10.090> attempting<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:11.530> 2%

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
percent to they're attempting to have 2%

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.420 
percent to they're attempting to have 2%
of<00:03:12.550> GDP<00:03:12.610> spent<00:03:13.209> on<00:03:13.330> health<00:03:13.540> care<00:03:14.070> even<00:03:15.070> then<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
of GDP spent on health care even then I

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.370 
of GDP spent on health care even then I
think<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:15.940> are<00:03:15.970> stupid<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.570> find<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.900> big<00:03:17.110> gap

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
think we are stupid to find a big gap

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.980 
think we are stupid to find a big gap
between<00:03:17.680> people<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.450> there<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.780> another
