 they are very happy and with many 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 our pilots we told them before 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.890
 the interview returned to the rabbit more 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 skinny from acapulco 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 yes yes a little bit this time it was a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 a beautiful preseason this we have 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 prepared in the best way and good 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 comes a difficult tournament very very 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 load the calendar this football 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 Mexican arms every time better not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.180
 great players arrive and every time 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.560
 more complicated to be champion yes yes it is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.480
 it's really hard all the teams have 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.020
 the possibility of being able to bring people 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.180
 capable good quality people and everything 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's very balanced so we have to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
 prepare for that for a tournament 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.270
 hard enough today to demand the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.650
 the fans have already grown before 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.660
 they were satisfied with entering the liguilla 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.600
 nothing more a good tournament now the people 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.700
 pachuca cries a guy like 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 Yes of course they and I also 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.360
 I also cry out for a title the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.060
 the truth is that this team has been 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 from above have been improving there is 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.000
 You have to remember that one of a time 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.090
 I did not have 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.530
 34 years that did not qualify this now 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.540
 has qualified now yes yes yes by 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.390
 course in our idea there is always the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.130
 look for the championship and we'll find it 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.600
 as of place all respect for the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.300
 players who have left the pachuca 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.369
 this campus seems to me that we see it more 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.530
 Compact looks on paper looks good 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.070
 for a girl but every time a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.260
 tournament does not always talk about this is not the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 only truth is when it goes in the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.030
 course of the same tournament and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.240
 that the team is seeing well 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 go sitting well is last year 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.470
 it was also a beautiful being a very team 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990
 compact and so it was so it was alive to the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 this end could not reach the final 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.040
 access the final and look for the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.300
 championship but it was a good tournament 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.759
 today we are with that same illusion 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 with a great great this mindset of 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.590
 look for the the first one to walk very well 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.450
 in the tournament and look for the qualification of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.910
 volcano soon and those who come with that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.709
 responsibility that they have to perform 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.510
 and you with that task not to make them 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.400
 understand what equipment they have come themselves 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 exactly right the time the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.690
