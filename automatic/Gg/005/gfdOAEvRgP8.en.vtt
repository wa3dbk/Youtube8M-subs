00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
then I'm going to grab a very fine

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.430 
then I'm going to grab a very fine
glitter<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:42.240> I'll<00:03:42.330> place<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.900> top<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.170> this

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
glitter and I'll place it on top of this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110 
glitter and I'll place it on top of this
you<00:03:43.800> don't<00:03:43.980> want<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.190> put<00:03:44.370> too<00:03:44.400> much<00:03:44.850> because

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you don't want to put too much because

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300 
you don't want to put too much because
then<00:03:45.240> it'll<00:03:45.480> look<00:03:45.660> chunky<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.980> want<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.220> go

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
then it'll look chunky so you want to go

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.920 
then it'll look chunky so you want to go
ahead<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.610> place<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> very<00:03:48.120> thin<00:03:48.420> layer<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
ahead and place a very thin layer of the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.320 
ahead and place a very thin layer of the
mixing<00:03:49.320> medium<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.950> then<00:03:50.310> place<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.090> glitter

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
mixing medium and then place the glitter

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.210 
mixing medium and then place the glitter
right<00:03:51.600> over<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.020> with<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.260> fingers<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.830> fine

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
right over it with the fingers I fine

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.800 
right over it with the fingers I fine
it's<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.550> little<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:53.940> easier<00:03:54.120> than<00:03:54.450> using<00:03:54.600> a

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it's a little bit easier than using a

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.510 
it's a little bit easier than using a
brush<00:03:55.020> but<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.530> all<00:03:55.739> personal<00:03:56.010> preference

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
brush but it's all personal preference

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.479 
brush but it's all personal preference
you<00:03:57.330> can<00:03:57.510> skip<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.959> step<00:03:58.200> if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.770> prefer<00:03:59.250> not

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
you can skip this step if you prefer not

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.790 
you can skip this step if you prefer not
to<00:03:59.640> have<00:03:59.700> any<00:03:59.970> glitter<00:04:00.300> on<00:04:00.540> your<00:04:00.569> eyes<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.260> think

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
lipstick because then it looks really

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.090 
lipstick because then it looks really
really<00:05:00.270> orange<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:01.080> that's<00:05:01.440> not<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.680> look<00:05:01.950> I

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
really orange and that's not the look I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.560 
really orange and that's not the look I
want<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.370> go<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:02.729> I<00:05:02.790> just<00:05:02.820> want<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.240> be<00:05:03.330> kind

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
of peachy and orange II kind of tone but

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.969 
of peachy and orange II kind of tone but
not<00:05:05.970> too<00:05:06.270> too<00:05:06.450> strong<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.500> can<00:05:07.740> kind<00:05:07.950> of

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
not too too strong so you can kind of

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.409 
not too too strong so you can kind of
play<00:05:08.160> with<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.400> lip<00:05:08.550> color<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.880> little<00:05:09.060> bit<00:05:09.330> if

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
play with the lip color a little bit if

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.960 
play with the lip color a little bit if
you<00:05:09.510> like<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.979> is<00:05:11.160> pretty<00:05:11.340> much<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.580> this

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
you like and that is pretty much it this

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.900 
you like and that is pretty much it this
is<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.150> look<00:05:12.510> very<00:05:13.140> very<00:05:13.470> beautiful<00:05:13.910> glittery

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
is a look very very beautiful glittery

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.700 
is a look very very beautiful glittery
effective<00:05:15.630> look<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.990> think<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.530> really

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
effective look I think this is really

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.250 
effective look I think this is really
nice<00:05:16.950> because<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.970> glitter<00:05:18.270> isn't<00:05:18.750> really

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
nice because the glitter isn't really

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.130 
nice because the glitter isn't really
really<00:05:19.530> bright<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:21.210> had<00:05:21.479> a<00:05:21.510> little<00:05:21.840> bit<00:05:22.110> of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
really bright and I had a little bit of

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.469 
really bright and I had a little bit of
fell<00:05:22.410> out<00:05:22.560> here<00:05:22.890> because<00:05:23.729> I<00:05:23.940> added<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.450> little

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
fell out here because I added a little

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.170 
fell out here because I added a little
bit<00:05:24.990> more<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:28.770> glitter<00:05:29.100> isn't<00:05:29.550> really<00:05:29.910> really

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
bit more the glitter isn't really really

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.870 
bit more the glitter isn't really really
thick<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:31.169> chunky<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.460> is<00:05:32.640> definitely

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
thick and chunky so this is definitely

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.960 
thick and chunky so this is definitely
great<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.110> any<00:05:34.320> kind<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.919> age<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.250> my<00:05:35.610> opinion

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
great for any kind of age in my opinion

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.700 
great for any kind of age in my opinion
you<00:05:36.450> don't

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
you don't

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.040
