let's<00:04:27.870> see<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.139> wanted<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.740> keep<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.370> skirt

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
let's see I wanted to keep the skirt

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.969 
let's see I wanted to keep the skirt
then<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.300> can<00:04:30.479> keep<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:30.900> skirt<00:04:31.199> send<00:04:31.800> back

then I can keep this skirt send back
everything<00:04:32.550> else<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:33.060> they'll<00:04:33.449> just<00:04:33.479> bill<00:04:33.930> me

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
for this skirt so I think this is a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.689 
for this skirt so I think this is a
great<00:04:36.270> way<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.810> build<00:04:37.349> up<00:04:37.620> your<00:04:37.680> wardrobe<00:04:38.099> and

great way to build up your wardrobe and
try<00:04:39.240> things<00:04:39.569> out<00:04:39.810> especially<00:04:40.319> if<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.490> don't

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
try things out especially if you don't

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.279 
try things out especially if you don't
know<00:04:41.910> what<00:04:42.120> really<00:04:42.300> looks<00:04:42.569> good<00:04:42.900> on<00:04:42.960> your

know what really looks good on your
shape<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.949> think<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:44.849> website<00:04:45.389> would<00:04:45.509> be

perfect<00:04:46.229> for<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.560> because<00:04:47.009> you<00:04:47.340> can<00:04:47.490> kind<00:04:47.759> of

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
perfect for you because you can kind of

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.900 
perfect for you because you can kind of
test<00:04:48.150> things<00:04:48.509> out<00:04:48.720> before<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.770> buy<00:04:50.009> it<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.669> see
