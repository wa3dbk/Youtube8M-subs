split<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.670> into<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.150> your<00:04:06.329> third<00:04:06.569> piece

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
split this into like your third piece

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.849 
split this into like your third piece
and<00:04:07.560> group<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.980> with<00:04:08.130> your<00:04:08.519> natural<00:04:08.910> hair<00:04:09.859> so

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
and group it with your natural hair so

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.710 
and group it with your natural hair so
then<00:04:11.220> take<00:04:11.549> this<00:04:13.790> throw<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:15.060> one<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.329> begin

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
then take this throw this one in begin

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.080 
then take this throw this one in begin

arm senegalese twist video
so<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.479> began<00:04:27.750> braiding<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.259> couple<00:04:28.770> times

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
so you began braiding a couple times

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.159 
so you began braiding a couple times
down<00:04:29.280> then<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.270> second<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.780> put<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.990> hair

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
down then you second and put the hair

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.780 
down then you second and put the hair
back<00:04:31.199> together<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.979> separated<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.580> two

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
back together that you separated in two

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.480 
back together that you separated in two
and<00:04:33.530> again<00:04:34.530> make<00:04:34.740> sure<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.100> same<00:04:35.130> piece

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
and again make sure it's the same piece

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.980 
and again make sure it's the same piece
of<00:04:35.520> hair<00:04:35.789> because<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.060> want<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.330> keep<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
of hair because you want to keep the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.240 
of hair because you want to keep the
same<00:04:37.199> thickness<00:04:37.500> all<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.889> way<00:04:37.949> down<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
same thickness all the way down the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.990 
same thickness all the way down the
braid<00:04:38.370> okay

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
braid okay

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.810 
braid okay
so<00:04:39.720> that's<00:04:39.930> my<00:04:40.050> beginning<00:04:40.440> braid<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:40.949> then

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
so that's my beginning braid and then

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.029 
so that's my beginning braid and then
you're<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.449> just<00:04:42.690> start<00:04:42.900> twisting<00:04:43.500> now

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
you're going to just start twisting now

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.800 
you're going to just start twisting now
the<00:04:44.100> things<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.550> these<00:04:44.699> are<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.180> much<00:04:45.330> easier

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the things that these are so much easier

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.480 
the things that these are so much easier
to<00:04:45.840> do<00:04:46.080> than<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.440> kinky<00:04:46.770> twists<00:04:47.070> because<00:04:47.370> you

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
to do than the kinky twists because you

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.100 
to do than the kinky twists because you
don't<00:04:47.639> have<00:04:47.759> to<00:04:47.850> twist<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.360> then<00:04:48.570> twist<00:04:48.900> or

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
don't have to twist and then twist or

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.900 
don't have to twist and then twist or
the<00:04:49.169> senegalese<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.400> actually<00:04:50.580> have<00:04:50.820> to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
the senegalese so you actually have to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.330 
the senegalese so you actually have to
do<00:04:51.120> remember<00:04:51.840> making<00:04:52.500> sure<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.800> cream<00:04:53.100> is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
do remember making sure the cream is

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.240 
do remember making sure the cream is
coating<00:04:53.729> all<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.360> hair<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:57.240> for<00:04:57.509> one<00:04:57.889> you<00:04:58.889> keep

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
coating all the hair so for one you keep

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.800 
coating all the hair so for one you keep
continually<00:04:59.729> moisturizing<00:05:00.389> your<00:05:00.479> hair<00:05:00.539> where

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
continually moisturizing your hair where

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.830 
continually moisturizing your hair where
you<00:05:00.900> have<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.169> in<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.590> then<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.970> just<00:05:03.660> makes

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
you have it in and then it just makes

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.070 
you have it in and then it just makes
the<00:05:04.050> braid<00:05:04.440> look<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.860> lot<00:05:05.070> neater<00:05:05.479> okay

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the braid look a lot neater okay

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840 
the braid look a lot neater okay
make<00:05:08.010> sure<00:05:08.130> it's<00:05:08.220> all<00:05:08.310> way<00:05:08.430> down<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.699> braid

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
make sure it's all way down the braid

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.310 
make sure it's all way down the braid
and<00:05:09.150> always<00:05:09.389> slap<00:05:09.630> some<00:05:09.780> in<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.960> back<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.260> my

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
and always slap some in the back of my

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.140 
and always slap some in the back of my
hand<00:05:10.560> because<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.949> makes<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.610> easier<00:05:11.910> for<00:05:11.940> me

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
hand because it makes it easier for me

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.670 
hand because it makes it easier for me
in<00:05:12.210> fluent<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.510> need<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.750> get<00:05:12.900> more<00:05:13.050> okay<00:05:13.440> so

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
in fluent I need to get more okay so

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.909 
in fluent I need to get more okay so
you're<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.520> going<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.820> start<00:05:15.030> twisting

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
you're just going to start twisting

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.129 
you're just going to start twisting
twisting<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.430> then<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.389> want<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.690> maintain

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
twisting and then you want to maintain

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.250 
twisting and then you want to maintain
the<00:05:19.919> tension<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.639> amount<00:05:20.849> of<00:05:20.970> tension<00:05:21.180> on<00:05:21.479> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
the tension the amount of tension on the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.620 
the tension the amount of tension on the
hair<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.740> entire<00:05:23.099> way<00:05:23.370> down<00:05:23.400> because<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.449> not

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
hair the entire way down because if not

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.350 
hair the entire way down because if not
it's<00:05:24.900> going<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.139> get<00:05:25.229> lumpy<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.190> then<00:05:27.180> that's

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
it's going to get lumpy and then that's

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.080 
it's going to get lumpy and then that's
what<00:05:27.509> it<00:05:27.599> makes<00:05:27.780> what<00:05:28.289> makes<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.830> actually<00:05:29.550> um
