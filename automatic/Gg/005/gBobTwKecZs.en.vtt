thing in there is the person and what's
very<00:01:44.330> impressive<00:01:45.020> about<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.440> e-class<00:01:45.770> is

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
very impressive about the e-class is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.860 
very impressive about the e-class is
that<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.760> integration<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.660> this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
that it's the integration of this

that it's the integration of this
technology<00:01:48.620> that<00:01:48.860> works<00:01:49.550> in<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.850> very

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
technology that works in a very
