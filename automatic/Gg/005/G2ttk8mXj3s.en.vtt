00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
different design so you don't have to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
different design so you don't have to
make<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.429> hang<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.939> or

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

make up make a like hang out or
something<00:00:30.920> even<00:00:31.920> though<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.610> which

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
something even though you do that which

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
something even though you do that which
is<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.180> quite<00:00:34.020> funny<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:34.829> doesn't

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is like quite funny it actually doesn't

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
is like quite funny it actually doesn't
actually<00:00:35.809> doesn't<00:00:36.809> actually<00:00:36.930> let<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:37.739> away

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
actually doesn't actually let it go away

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.319 
actually doesn't actually let it go away
it<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.340> stays<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.239> pretty

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
it actually stays which is pretty

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
it actually stays which is pretty
example<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:42.379> yeah<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> ever<00:00:44.250> wondering

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
example and yeah if you ever wondering

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.660 
example and yeah if you ever wondering
for<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.800> tile<00:00:47.520> color<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:49.670> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
for what this tile color is it's then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.720 
for what this tile color is it's then
this<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> looks<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this one it looks like and what that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
this one it looks like and what that
that's<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.480> looks<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.350> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that's what it looks like right there so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
that's what it looks like right there so
it<00:00:55.800> goes<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> red<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> bit

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it goes a little bit of red then a bit

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
it goes a little bit of red then a bit
green<00:00:57.989> less<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.739> tiny<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> boy<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
green less and then tiny bit of boy I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
green less and then tiny bit of boy I
mean<00:01:00.210> halfway<00:01:00.690> pool<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> um

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
mean halfway pool or something so the um

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
mean halfway pool or something so the um
I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.390> much<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
I think that's more much about it and I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
I think that's more much about it and I
wanted<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> show<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> enzymes<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
wanted to show you the enzymes what it's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.330 
wanted to show you the enzymes what it's
like<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> colored<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> rounder<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
like this is a colored and rounder I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.810 
like this is a colored and rounder I
know<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.850> um<00:01:12.500> you'll<00:01:13.500> find<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> ensign<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
know I so um you'll find the ensign on

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.410 
know I so um you'll find the ensign on
Camille<00:01:15.720> mass<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.259> something<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.420> when

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Camille mass or something and then when

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.670 
Camille mass or something and then when
you<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:21.030> faces<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> wind<00:01:21.990> where<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> goes

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you go it faces the wind where it goes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
you go it faces the wind where it goes
blows<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.850> see<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.180> my

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
blows and as you can see there's my

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170 
blows and as you can see there's my
result<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.700> face

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
result right there it's actually a face

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.950 
result right there it's actually a face
of<00:01:27.390> me<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.930> actually<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.710> funny

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
of me which is actually quite funny

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.950 
of me which is actually quite funny
quite<00:01:30.960> weird<00:01:31.430> trillions<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.960> legacy

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
quite weird trillions on here legacy

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
quite weird trillions on here legacy
that's<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.290> enzyme<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.700> me

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that's my enzyme there it's actually me

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.929 
that's my enzyme there it's actually me
um<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.049> place<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.009> long<00:01:38.310> time<00:01:38.369> ago<00:01:38.610> and

um at this place a long time ago and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
um at this place a long time ago and
while<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.390> meant<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.350> video<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> only<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
finishing I haven't actually finished it

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.719 
finishing I haven't actually finished it
seems<00:01:54.659> completely<00:01:54.869> oldest<00:01:55.380> now

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729

 um assessee how long since about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.520 
 um assessee how long since about
two<00:02:04.829> hundred<00:02:05.119> I'm<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.659> needed<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.229> make

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
two hundred I'm I think I needed to make

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.530 
two hundred I'm I think I needed to make
this<00:02:08.390> something<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.750> let<00:02:09.929> me<00:02:10.140> check<00:02:10.500> something
