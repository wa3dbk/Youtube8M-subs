 sedona the sound desert and for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.180
 course the big canyon and look looking 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.449
 a camera that would provide me with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.320
 quality in both video and photo 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 It happened to take me this new nikon from 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.520

 here I have the box of lan and with 5.200 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.780
 the white oval indicates that the body of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 the camera is black remember 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.839
 that the nikon of 5,200 is also 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 Available in copper and color 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.460
 red so it will not get confused in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.180
 the top of the box we can see 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.479
 that this particular kit is 1855 from 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 r &amp; b girl r kit what indicates that the set 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.179

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 millimeters on the side of the box we have 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:10.619
 also the indications of what 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.899
 includes the package and the logos that we 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.990
 mark the compatibility of this camera 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.020
 with windows mac quick windows 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.429
 time and connectivity with sd memories 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.230
 xc and hdmi output so that you can 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.540
 connect to your television 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.580
 Once the street is open, we find the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.040
 sheet of guarantee policy of the camera 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.860
 brochures about guarantee programs 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.590
 of nikon and also a package of manuals 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 and instructive of it the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.760
 different components of the camera 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.980
 They come perfectly packed in 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.200
 individual sections with caps 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.690
 cardboard what I'm going to do first is 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 remove the body from the camera is very 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 well packed and protected with a bag 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.829
 my first impression of the body of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.899
 camera is that it is very light does not weigh the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.670
 construction quality looks good 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.489
 solid resistant and I commented that the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.890
 body is a black plastic very 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.310
 resistant 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.050
 has a rotating screen opens without 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.780
 effort and I can prove that it turns well 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.060
 at the same time I see that the body of the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.640
 camera includes a cover to protect 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.410
 both the mirror and the sensor before 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.630
 place the lens 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.320
 This kit includes a strap with letters 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.600
 nikon printed an audio and video cable 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.330
 to connect conventional television 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.390
 a usb cable to download 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.490
 photographs from the camera and also to 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860
 through it you can update the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.930
 firmware of it is to say all the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.769
 system 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.349
 It is packed very well in bubble paper 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.349
 here I find the battery comes too 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.659
 inside a bag and static and the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:05.629

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.420
 el14 in turn comes protected with a 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.900
 transparent plastic lid 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.540
 similarly I find the m24 charger 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.580
 of individual battery the battery 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.050
 Charger space and ready this 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.940
 Charger is wall does not need in 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.140
 no other type of cable what makes it 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.140
 very comfortable to travel 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.819
 at the end in the last cardboard packaging 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.579
 I find the camera lens 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:42.349

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.239

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.249
 an individual plastic bag 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.980
 includes a transparent cover on the 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:52.730
 connection port with the camera and a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.800
 standard cap to protect the lens 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.840
 I can also see that this lens has 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.110
 a manual focus adjustment switch and 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.180
 automatic to one side place the lens 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.430
 it's very simple you just have to align the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.700
 white dots both body and 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.500
 lens and turn slightly without forcing 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.830
 opposite side of the hands of the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.599

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.350

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:21.229
 just open and slide the battery

 to install the sd card the card 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.330
 sd must be placed with the cover 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.479
 up and I recommend a memory 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.639
 of at least 32 gigabytes since the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.669
 both photo and video files that 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.110
 produces the camera can be heavy 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.960
 we turn on the camera with the switch on the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.430
 top we open the screen and there 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.700

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.370
