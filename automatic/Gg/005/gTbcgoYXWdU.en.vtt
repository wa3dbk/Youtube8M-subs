that type of film gives you that a
mainstream<00:00:12.809> film<00:00:13.259> doesn't<00:00:14.389> a<00:00:16.550> very<00:00:17.550> quick

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
mainstream film doesn't a very quick

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900 
mainstream film doesn't a very quick
shoot<00:00:18.439> it<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.560> only<00:00:19.710> 16<00:00:20.279> days<00:00:20.310> prints

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

Avalanche<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.340> fast<00:00:23.869> way

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
Avalanche it was just a very fast way

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.670 
Avalanche it was just a very fast way
that<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.500> picked<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:27.500> think<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that it just picked up and I think that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
that it just picked up and I think that
sometimes<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.760> smaller<00:00:30.330> movies

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
sometimes some of these smaller movies

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.500 
sometimes some of these smaller movies
words<00:00:31.080> they<00:00:32.040> don't<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.369> enough<00:00:32.820> money<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
words they don't have enough money to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.430 
words they don't have enough money to
have<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.829> action<00:00:35.190> sequences<00:00:35.640> or

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
have a big action sequences or

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
have a big action sequences or
necessarily<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> plot<00:00:38.719> or<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> lot

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
necessarily like a lot of plot or a lot

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590 
necessarily like a lot of plot or a lot
of<00:00:40.050> locations<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:41.910> forced<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
of locations you know you're forced to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
of locations you know you're forced to
kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:44.660> rely<00:00:45.660> more<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.020> character<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> that's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
kind of rely more on character so that's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
kind of rely more on character so that's
that's<00:00:48.539> always<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> benefit<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> actors

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that's always a benefit for the actors

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
that's always a benefit for the actors
because<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.550> more<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:52.020> stuff<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
because you get more more more stuff to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220 
because you get more more more stuff to
play<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.100> explore<00:00:53.510> well<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.719> these<00:00:54.930> smaller

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
play and explore well with these smaller

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
play and explore well with these smaller
scale<00:00:55.590> films<00:00:55.949> they're<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.489> beneficial<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
scale films they're very beneficial to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.580 
scale films they're very beneficial to
those<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.350> would<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.469> say

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
those making it but what would you say

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.369 
those making it but what would you say
are<00:00:58.710> some<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> benefits<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> audience

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
are some of the benefits to the audience

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.020 
are some of the benefits to the audience
benefits<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> audience<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.370> guess<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
benefits see the audience I guess that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.579 
benefits see the audience I guess that
just<00:01:03.180> depends<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> audience<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
just depends on what the audience is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
just depends on what the audience is
looking<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.270> you
