00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 vitesse has already boosted self-confidence 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
 against Ajax last Sunday 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.459
 long players cannot enjoy 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.780
 the good result 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.730
 pound Wednesday is next 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.289
 then race on the program again 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 starts running out and today the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.170
 second day to the law will again 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.880
 prepared for going on cambuur so go 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 quickly how do you have 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 enjoyed doing 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.190
 good thing i always do is a competition 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 and check on my to this competition 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.420
 I actually thought it was better to look at it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 then that I experienced on the couch 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.559
 we have got local we were happy 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 to each other 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.400
 proud so finally succeeded 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.700
 what you have been waiting for for a week 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.010
 to-day the name was a focus on may this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 what did you think of public because can me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.680
 imagine you enjoyed it too 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.000
 have got 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.350
 yes but I do anyway always 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.030
 becomes an interaction between the team 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.220
 and I think we don't like that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.780
 to complain here in the Gelredome 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.399
 People will always find that few 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.610
 audience comes to it I think 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.860
 not at all if she is 17,000 men that is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.659
 were nice against Ajax such as 20,000 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
 but I always have those people 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 stand behind the team and if you do too 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 looks in groningen where we are in a row 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.729
 with behind and like fat behind 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 came the 400 men therewith was traveling circus 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.310
 they are constantly behind the team 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 stay 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.690
 so that's what i just said so one 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.920
 interact with that those people do that 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.299
 can continue to muster I am from 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.650
 convinced that our players can too 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.909
 to continue to go very deep 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.740
 and of course that also had to be against Ajax 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.180
 go rusting agent hey was over 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.799
 Sunday involved in the winning 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 goal of vitesse 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.180
 the left back operated duty bike 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.909
 size that then hit beautifully 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 spotted by bas hand on the chest of van 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.210
 from Brugge 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 he makes a nice in two with 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 something like that you gave you a propaganda ball again 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.430
 back to me and I thought yes I have to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 him immediately for a swing and what that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.560
 after that I still didn't 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.610
 he scored a fantastic goal and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.500
 thoughts went back to you for a moment 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.390
 first match for vitesse against rkc 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.909
 from 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.820
 already a week because if in the same alone 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.820
 mike I have for such a good inzell 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.810
 technology as a breed that made a tackle 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 and there was also a very beautiful one 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.220
 goal but give this stimulus that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.200
 pholus guram kashia shot ended 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.280
 against Ajax a suspension from 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.690
 a duel 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.970
 here he went before the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.410
 contest in the photo with fans on the theo 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.270
 forest stand 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.400
 tomorrow at cambuur it will be again 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.550
 he was available to a good series 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.840
 busy playing him well but I have to 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.200
 Immediately say that his replacement 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.180
 then mori did an excellent job 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.209
 but well our offer is back 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 they will certainly be missing tomorrow night 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.070
 there Kruiswijk still and debugger 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.959
 ebar got a kick early in the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.239
 match against ajax 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.690
 so what exactly number for 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.340
 some hard to see but they went 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.630
 standing full on the back of his leg and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.920
 of course it won't be on purpose 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.140
 happened because that would be very bad 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.540
 its what happened 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 and yes that there is that in his calf 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.709
 reason space you that region of the housing 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.630
 been a big hit against without 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.280
 cambuur is currently on the ninth 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 place a spot in the league 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.780
 higher by vitesse the arnhemmers can 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.700
 go over the friezes on Wednesday evening 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.739
 but then there must be on the artificial grass 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 be won well we come across 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.829
 I think it's a very good team to play 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.090
 I now have a work page myself 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.140
 seen including against twente 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.549
 enschede 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.380
 we are we few shifts that are dominant 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.090
 are in enschede but it was only that 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.640
 Cambuur though they have certain there 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.079
 well footballed hair and I really like it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.120
 cleverly lost and very unhappy 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.140
 we have to play again 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.170
 just good football 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.690
 and with results also there and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.239
 By the way, have been able to have a very good audience 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.890
 artificial grass is for example from one 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.910
 advantage for us and for their making 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.680
 smoking for us are what we do 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.030
 like to play soccer 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.410
 and now I have an excuse for the ball 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.410
 jumps too badly on the field
