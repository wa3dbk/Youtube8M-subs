plugin<00:00:06.629> tutorial<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> figured<00:00:08.010> I'd<00:00:08.130> do

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
plugin tutorial that I figured I'd do

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.280 
plugin tutorial that I figured I'd do
because<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> just<00:00:08.790> implemented<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> onto<00:00:10.170> my

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
because I just implemented it onto my

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.790 
because I just implemented it onto my
server

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
server

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.930 
server
crazy<00:00:11.519> economy<00:00:12.000> craft<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:13.400> figured<00:00:14.400> I'd<00:00:14.519> give

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
crazy economy craft and figured I'd give

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.250 
crazy economy craft and figured I'd give
you<00:00:14.969> guys<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.509> rundown<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
you guys a little rundown of it

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.870 
you guys a little rundown of it
so<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.580> plugin<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> called<00:00:18.449> leader<00:00:18.990> heads<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
so the plugin is called leader heads and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
so the plugin is called leader heads and
what<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.970> does<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.420> implements<00:00:21.990> itself<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
what it does it implements itself with a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439 
what it does it implements itself with a
bunch<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> other<00:00:23.160> plugins<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:24.180> I'll<00:00:24.330> name

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
bunch of other plugins which I'll name

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.980 
bunch of other plugins which I'll name
now<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> works<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.119> scoreboard<00:00:27.660> stats

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
now so it works with scoreboard stats

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.299 
now so it works with scoreboard stats

wicked sky wars so what it does is it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
wicked sky wars so what it does is it
pulls<00:00:44.100> information<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.210> plugins

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pulls information from those plugins

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
pulls information from those plugins
which<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.260> already<00:00:46.559> implemented<00:00:47.280> into

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
which you have already implemented into

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
which you have already implemented into
your<00:00:47.610> server<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.570> haven't<00:00:48.870> already<00:00:48.960> you

your server if you haven't already you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
your server if you haven't already you
need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> implement<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.420> pull

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
need to implement it so it can pull

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
need to implement it so it can pull
those<00:00:51.840> stats<00:00:52.199> onto<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> plugin<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
those stats onto the plugin so what this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.639 
those stats onto the plugin so what this
plugin<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
plugin is gonna do is it's gonna on you

plugin is gonna do is it's gonna on you
create<00:00:55.949> signs<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> head<00:00:57.059> above<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
create signs with a head above it and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.849 
create signs with a head above it and
it's<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.129> pull<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> stat<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.539> whatever

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
it's gonna pull the stat from whatever

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
it's gonna pull the stat from whatever
thing<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:02.010> pulling<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.629> for

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
thing you're pulling from so for

I<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.409> top<00:01:07.619> kills<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.189> my

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I have I have the top kills for my

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
I have I have the top kills for my
server<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.390> scoreboard<00:01:09.900> stats

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
server so I have scoreboard stats

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
server so I have scoreboard stats
implemented<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.310> server<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.270> right

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
implemented on my server on the right

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
implemented on my server on the right
side<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> screen<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.290> you'll<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
side of the screen there you'll see that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
side of the screen there you'll see that
I<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.820> scoreboard<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I have the scoreboard so right now it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.060 
I have the scoreboard so right now it
has<00:01:16.890> how<00:01:17.549> many<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> has<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:19.920> much

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
has how many so it has I'm at how much

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.810 
has how many so it has I'm at how much
economy<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.080> balanced<00:01:22.820> scoreboard

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
economy so this the balanced scoreboard

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
economy so this the balanced scoreboard
is<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.210> needed<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.960> balance<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> show<00:01:25.619> up

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is not needed for the balance to show up

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.210 
is not needed for the balance to show up
on<00:01:25.920> signs<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:28.020> scoreboard<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.770> pull<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
on signs but scoreboard does pull the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.960 
on signs but scoreboard does pull the
balances<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.570> economy<00:01:31.079> plugin<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
balances from your economy plugin so it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870 
balances from your economy plugin so it
shows<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.659> balance<00:01:34.110> deaths<00:01:34.979> kills<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
shows the balance deaths kills and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 
shows the balance deaths kills and
players<00:01:36.210> online<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.340> scoreboard<00:01:38.790> stats

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
players online so the scoreboard stats

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.539 
players online so the scoreboard stats
one<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.600> only<00:01:39.720> show<00:01:40.079> kills<00:01:40.470> kill<00:01:41.189> streaks

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
one will only show kills kill streaks

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.359 
one will only show kills kill streaks
and<00:01:41.850> mob<00:01:42.540> kills<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.710> write<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and mob kills so write it right here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.410 
and mob kills so write it right here
ahead<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.299> kills<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.590> mob<00:01:47.100> kills

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
ahead of me I have kills and mob kills

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
ahead of me I have kills and mob kills
obviously<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.729> doing

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
obviously so the way you go about doing

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.530 
obviously so the way you go about doing
and<00:01:51.600> creating<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:52.140> signs<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.799> server

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
and creating these signs on your server

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.819 
and creating these signs on your server
so<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.689> sure<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.259> scoreboard

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so make sure you have your scoreboard

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.120 
so make sure you have your scoreboard
stats<00:01:56.100> plug-in<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:58.200> server<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> then

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
stats plug-in on on your server and then

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
stats plug-in on on your server and then
you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.399> implement<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.110> once<00:02:01.110> you've

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you can implement this once you've

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
you can implement this once you've
implemented<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.040> leader<00:02:02.280> heads<00:02:02.610> plugin<00:02:03.090> onto

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
implemented the leader heads plugin onto

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.889 
implemented the leader heads plugin onto
your<00:02:03.390> server

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
your server

I've<00:02:53.080> noticed<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.590> server<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.220> six<00:02:54.910> seven

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
I've noticed on my server that six seven

I've noticed on my server that six seven
eight<00:02:55.450> nine<00:02:55.750> do<00:02:56.290> not<00:02:56.440> pull<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.830> information

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
in balance

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.510 
in balance
Bauman's<00:04:04.240> balanced<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:06.020> once<00:04:06.800> again<00:04:06.980> the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
Bauman's balanced and once again the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.540 
Bauman's balanced and once again the
position<00:04:08.210> is<00:04:08.390> important<00:04:09.050> one<00:04:09.740> two<00:04:09.860> nine<00:04:10.040> all

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
position is important one two nine all

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.970 
position is important one two nine all
one<00:04:11.060> two<00:04:11.150> nine<00:04:11.300> works<00:04:11.600> on<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.990> one<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:12.830> let's

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
one two nine works on this one so let's

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.980 
one two nine works on this one so let's
say<00:04:13.130> we<00:04:13.250> want<00:04:13.430> five<00:04:13.670> on<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:13.970> server<00:04:14.210> here<00:04:14.900> we

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
say we want five on the server here we

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.770 
say we want five on the server here we
go<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.730> bottom<00:04:16.850> left<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.270> noticed<00:04:17.660> it

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
go so on the bottom left we noticed it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.660 
go so on the bottom left we noticed it
works<00:04:17.989> there<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.800> go<00:04:18.920> we've<00:04:19.250> pulled<00:04:19.489> the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
works there you go we've pulled the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.090 
works there you go we've pulled the
information<00:04:21.640> 136,000<00:04:22.640> on<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.900> server<00:04:24.140> there

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
information 136,000 on the server there

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.540 
information 136,000 on the server there
we<00:04:25.220> go<00:04:25.370> that's<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.120> plug<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.340> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
we go that's the plug in the in the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.520 
we go that's the plug in the in the
configuration<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.540> can<00:04:29.690> changes<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> colors

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
configuration you can changes the colors

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.920 
configuration you can changes the colors
of<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.830> signs<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.940> actually<00:04:32.390> what<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.630> starts

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
of the signs so actually what it starts

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.160 
of the signs so actually what it starts
off<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:34.730> name<00:04:35.000> will<00:04:35.390> actually<00:04:35.720> be<00:04:35.870> yellow

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
off is the name will actually be yellow

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.130 
off is the name will actually be yellow
and<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:37.010> money<00:04:37.220> will<00:04:37.430> be<00:04:37.460> green<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.150> found<00:04:38.990> it

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
and the money will be green I found it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.500 
and the money will be green I found it
hard<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.350> read<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:39.890> changed<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:41.300> worked

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
hard to read so I changed it it worked

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.300 
hard to read so I changed it it worked
no<00:04:41.630> problem<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.290> restart<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.710> server<00:04:42.950> picks

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
no problem you restart the server picks

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.620 
no problem you restart the server picks
up<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.550> colors<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.970> don't<00:04:44.060> need<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.390> remake

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
up the colors you don't need to remake

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.950 
up the colors you don't need to remake
the<00:04:44.810> signs<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.400> also<00:04:46.550> pull<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.390> GUI

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
the signs so you can also pull up a GUI

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.650 
the signs so you can also pull up a GUI
for<00:04:48.500> each<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.250> stats<00:04:49.940> you'd<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.420> pull

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
for each of the stats you'd like to pull

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.680 
for each of the stats you'd like to pull
from<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.260> server<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.150> let's<00:04:53.330> say<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:53.540> want<00:04:53.660> to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
from the server so let's say you want to

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.860 
from the server so let's say you want to
check<00:04:53.930> out<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.710> scoreboard<00:04:55.430> stats<00:04:55.790> kills<00:04:56.210> so

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
check out the scoreboard stats kills so

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.190 
check out the scoreboard stats kills so
in<00:04:57.500> your<00:04:57.680> configuration<00:04:57.890> you'll<00:04:58.640> set<00:04:58.880> up<00:04:58.910> the

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
in your configuration you'll set up the

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.050 
in your configuration you'll set up the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
command that you need to type you just

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.640 
command that you need to type you just
need<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> type<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.600> in<00:05:02.690> there<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.080> you'll<00:05:03.410> set

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
need to type it in there and you'll set

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.240 
need to type it in there and you'll set
it<00:05:04.180> default<00:05:05.180> it's<00:05:05.450> set<00:05:05.540> up<00:05:05.660> as<00:05:05.870> top<00:05:06.140> mob<00:05:06.650> kills

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
it default it's set up as top mob kills

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.120 
it default it's set up as top mob kills
for<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.300> top<00:05:08.480> mob<00:05:08.690> kills<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.770> you'd<00:05:09.890> have<00:05:09.920> been

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
for the top mob kills so you'd have been

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.690 
for the top mob kills so you'd have been
slash<00:05:10.400> top<00:05:10.790> mob<00:05:11.480> kills<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.250> brings<00:05:13.490> up<00:05:13.640> a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
slash top mob kills and it brings up a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.280 
slash top mob kills and it brings up a
little<00:05:13.820> GUI<00:05:14.270> one<00:05:15.230> two<00:05:15.830> three<00:05:16.490> four<00:05:16.970> five<00:05:17.390> that

little GUI one two three four five that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.780 
little GUI one two three four five that
would<00:05:18.380> actually<00:05:18.650> explain<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.190> six<00:05:19.460> seven

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
would actually explain the six seven

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.060 
would actually explain the six seven
eight<00:05:19.940> nine<00:05:19.970> don't<00:05:20.900> exist<00:05:21.350> for<00:05:21.560> some<00:05:21.590> reason

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
eight nine don't exist for some reason

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.740 
eight nine don't exist for some reason
not<00:05:22.430> sure<00:05:22.700> if<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:22.970> only<00:05:23.060> picks<00:05:23.270> up<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.570> top

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
not sure if it only picks up the top

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.800 
not sure if it only picks up the top
five<00:05:23.780> for<00:05:24.350> scoreboard<00:05:24.770> stats

five for scoreboard stats

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.380 
five for scoreboard stats
anyways<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.020> there's<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.530> name<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.390> the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
anyways so there's the name and the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.710 
anyways so there's the name and the
ballot<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.960> amount<00:05:30.860> which<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.400> actually<00:05:31.820> hard

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
ballot the amount which is actually hard

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.770 
ballot the amount which is actually hard
to<00:05:32.810> read<00:05:33.050> because<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:34.010> said<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.250> black<00:05:34.640> in<00:05:34.970> my

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
to read because I said to black in my

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.570 
to read because I said to black in my
configuration<00:05:36.590> which<00:05:37.490> matches<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.090> sign<00:05:39.580> and

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
configuration which matches the sign and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.850 
configuration which matches the sign and
we<00:05:40.940> would<00:05:41.030> test<00:05:41.330> another<00:05:41.540> one<00:05:41.690> top<00:05:42.020> balances

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
we would test another one top balances

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.610 
we would test another one top balances
which<00:05:43.430> is<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.700> balanced<00:05:44.030> one<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:45.200> there<00:05:45.500> we

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
which is the balanced one and there we

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.290 
which is the balanced one and there we
go

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
go

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.409 
go
everything<00:05:47.960> read<00:05:48.139> there<00:05:48.319> top<00:05:48.590> nine<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:50.240> it's<00:05:50.300> a

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
everything read there top nine so it's a

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.110 
everything read there top nine so it's a
great<00:05:50.599> plugin<00:05:51.039> glad<00:05:52.039> you<00:05:52.220> guys<00:05:52.340> tuned<00:05:52.639> in<00:05:52.819> for
