there's a guy called federal Nadal or

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.319 
there's a guy called federal Nadal or
Djokovic<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> matter<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> other

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
Djokovic for that matter on the other

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.400 
Djokovic for that matter on the other
side<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.850> freeze<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:49.020> don't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
side they start to to freeze they don't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
side they start to to freeze they don't
they<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.590> play<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:50.430> anymore<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:51.000> they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
can so I think it's a question of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.150 
can so I think it's a question of
mentality

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
mentality

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.610
