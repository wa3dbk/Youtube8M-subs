00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.140

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.929

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.640
 an aspect since it is more playful so in this club if the goal is to 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.430
 train some young people what is comical things without hurting themselves the year 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.269
 purpose drinks but stuntmen feel different things from the powder 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.579
 here in the bumps I'm at the same skiers park cross gradually became 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.340
 a bit pique m it does not hurt since it is really complete it is 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.389
 really the goal of having a complete skier 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.039
 and then thanks to the red light workouts 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.379
 then traveled and 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.209
 through the alps through in the various competitions organized 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.079
 for young people and this is the opportunity to meet between different clubs 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.359
 between different massifs it goes well a good atmosphere so 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.419
 young people come back every time you smile 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.689
 cross 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.689
 his team 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.119
 hasseni who were going to attack the guys to whom 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.119
 harmony to do this 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.359
 Greece had swayed 13 year old I was not enough for 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.339
 to buy cyclists 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:16.489
 there I started what is two and a half years later in the gp of the rep 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.709
 because it's not sad 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.959
 around 6 o'clock 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.959
 coca-cola really years old was starting to be known 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.599
 the walks I especially keep the protesters from traveling so this is 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.319
 could be done 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.529
 obama after age view 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.899
 I do correspondence courses in what allows me to get a lot 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.790
 now we can see in France special processions for Greek titles 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.499
 and the titles that mock 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.069
 landed at afp and also with mediators that's why france year 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.839
 is also one more element who is who he has slumped the six special 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:51.259
 in smaller size 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.300
 so that's cool and tight 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 it leaves hope for the young 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.580
 so the middle of christ and people to vote this super young and sport show 

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:33.059
 with mason the best riders visit a quad 18 19 years and now we see 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.169
 already requests 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.489
 dakar 16 years old who are able to come to the podium with the best 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.539
 possible internationals we have created a team salomon where it is now 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.489
 just two years, which is less than 15 years old and then after he 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.349
 still managed by by have managed by their club coach and not 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.879
 for mathos superheroes to take them on a few events from 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.129
 every now and then to do a little promo of the bull cloud and bring them a little 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.199
 in the middle and throw them on the circuit 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.389
 the course will be present not the physical to rely still on 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.939
 big tables and that's why we make them small modules 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:03.830
 suitable 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.189
 because you have to decriminalize and fifth third is still quiet when you say 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.189
 pakistan and in 20 years and be broken 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.039
 I think young artists are really important because that 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.689
 respite 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.949
 it is he who will give the pros challenged to the second set head 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.939
 after the small door sacem we see that there are more and more young people from 16 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.129
 to 20 deaths by assisted suicide 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.860
 they all want to be better at the time to write it's really 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.800
 excellent in the evening 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.370
 and there it goes up it goes up fast 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.900
 I think that in a few years this is a workforce the offer of free
