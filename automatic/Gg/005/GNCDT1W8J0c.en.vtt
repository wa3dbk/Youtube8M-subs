hey this is TJ with the shopbot tools

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.430 
hey this is TJ with the shopbot tools
and<00:00:08.610> if<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> desktops<00:00:10.050> that

came with the installed spoiler board

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.289 
came with the installed spoiler board
and<00:00:13.019> then<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.370> now<00:00:14.549> trimmed<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> deck

the next thing we'll be doing is cutting

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
the next thing we'll be doing is cutting
the<00:00:17.430> quick<00:00:18.000> jig<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> quick<00:00:19.050> jig<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the quick jig and what the quick jig is

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
the quick jig and what the quick jig is
is<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> series<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:20.580> clamping<00:00:21.060> parts

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
is a series of little clamping parts

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.570 
is a series of little clamping parts
that<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.320> cut<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> spoil<00:00:23.279> board

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that we have cut into the spoil board

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.080 
that we have cut into the spoil board
and<00:00:23.789> these<00:00:24.180> jigs<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.019> useful<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> help

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
and these jigs will be useful to help

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.970 
and these jigs will be useful to help
hold<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.480> parts<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.019> place<00:00:28.410> while<00:00:28.710> cutting

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
hold your parts in place while cutting

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620 
hold your parts in place while cutting
all<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.449> cutting

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
all right now we're going to be cutting

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.740 
all right now we're going to be cutting
holes<00:00:31.260> into<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.710> spoil<00:00:32.160> board<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> quick

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
holes into the spoil board for a quick

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
holes into the spoil board for a quick
jig<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.860> machine<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.430> drill<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.390> these

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
jig and our machine will drill out these

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.979 
jig and our machine will drill out these
three<00:00:36.960> eighths<00:00:37.969> diameter<00:00:38.969> holes<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.719> into

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
three eighths diameter holes right into

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
three eighths diameter holes right into
the<00:00:40.079> spoil<00:00:40.410> board<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the spoil board and that would be the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.900 
the spoil board and that would be the
locations<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.629> our<00:00:42.719> mounting<00:00:43.200> pieces

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
locations for all of our mounting pieces

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.979 
locations for all of our mounting pieces
alright<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.420> locate<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
alright we're going to go locate the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
alright we're going to go locate the
file<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> quick<00:00:46.770> jig<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.640> load

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
file for the quick jig so we can load

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.540 
file for the quick jig so we can load
that<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.450> verify<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.680> zeroed

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that up just verify that you have zeroed

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
that up just verify that you have zeroed
your<00:00:50.730> X<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.120> Y<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.449> Y<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.539> z<00:00:51.809> axes<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.160> have

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
your X or Y and Y or z axes and you have

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
your X or Y and Y or z axes and you have
your<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.610> properly<00:00:54.149> installed<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.870> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
your bit properly installed at that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.240 
your bit properly installed at that
point<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.750> cut<00:00:57.960> part<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
point we can now go to cut part and this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.529 
point we can now go to cut part and this
is<00:00:59.399> where<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.640> need<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> go<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> locate<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
is where we need to go and locate the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.009 
is where we need to go and locate the
file<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.829> looking<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.430> our<00:01:03.019> folder

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
alright we just drilled our six holes

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.179 
alright we just drilled our six holes
into<00:02:28.049> our<00:02:28.139> spoiler<00:02:28.409> board<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.859> our<00:02:28.950> quick

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
into our spoiler board for our quick

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.670 
into our spoiler board for our quick
Jake<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:30.209> these<00:02:30.389> holes<00:02:30.689> fit<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.109> dowels<00:02:31.349> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
Jake so these holes fit the dowels that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.399 
Jake so these holes fit the dowels that
come<00:02:31.829> with<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.480> start<00:02:33.480> by<00:02:33.599> placing<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.109> four

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
come with it start by placing the four
