00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
by a slightly bigger plot I'm guessing

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.449 
by a slightly bigger plot I'm guessing
it's<00:02:46.849> ten<00:02:47.090> inch<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:51.969> this<00:02:52.969> is<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> tough<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it's ten inch a this is a tough for the

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.589 
it's ten inch a this is a tough for the
the<00:02:55.459> steamer<00:02:56.620> add-on<00:02:57.879> so<00:02:58.879> for<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.420> could

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
the steamer add-on so for this you could

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.209 
the steamer add-on so for this you could
steam<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.200> buns<00:03:00.620> or<00:03:02.590> steamed<00:03:03.590> vegetables

really<00:03:04.730> quickly<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:44.419> then<00:03:44.569> finally<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:46.269> ten

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
really quickly and then finally the ten

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:57.189 
really quickly and then finally the ten
inch<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:55.479> don't<00:03:56.479> know<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:56.780> it's<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.989> bigger

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
layers inside the bottom one is a

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.700 
layers inside the bottom one is a
stainless<00:05:20.250> steel<00:05:20.430> protective<00:05:21.210> rubber<00:05:21.710> which

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
stainless steel protective rubber which

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.000 
stainless steel protective rubber which
is<00:05:23.190> good<00:05:23.670> for<00:05:24.000> distribution<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:25.440> aluminum

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
is good for distribution the aluminum

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.700 
is good for distribution the aluminum
core<00:05:26.310> make<00:05:26.910> sure<00:05:27.120> that<00:05:27.300> everything<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:28.080> heated

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
core make sure that everything is heated

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.860 
core make sure that everything is heated
evenly<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.880> then<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.150> stainless<00:05:30.390> steel

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.150 
evenly and then the stainless steel
inside<00:05:31.530> make<00:05:32.520> sure<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:33.000> everything<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:34.160> also

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
inside make sure that everything is also

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.310 
inside make sure that everything is also
I<00:05:35.520> guess<00:05:35.790> it's<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.540> another<00:05:36.780> protective

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
I guess it's like another protective

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.610 
I guess it's like another protective
layer<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.890> mean<00:05:38.730> that<00:05:38.880> makes<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.360> so<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:40.230> it

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
layer I mean that makes it so that it

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.260 
layer I mean that makes it so that it
doesn't<00:05:40.950> stick<00:05:41.040> as<00:05:41.310> much<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.090> cookware

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
doesn't stick as much to the cookware

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.760 
doesn't stick as much to the cookware
because<00:05:42.540> if<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:43.110> something<00:05:43.470> that's

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
because if you have something that's

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.860 
because if you have something that's
solid<00:05:43.920> stainless<00:05:44.400> steel<00:05:44.760> you'll<00:05:45.360> usually<00:05:45.570> get

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
solid stainless steel you'll usually get

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.900 
solid stainless steel you'll usually get
something<00:05:46.140> that<00:05:46.410> easily<00:05:46.740> sticks<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.700> pan

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
something that easily sticks to the pan

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.710 
something that easily sticks to the pan
and<00:05:48.390> it's<00:05:48.510> hard<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.750> get<00:05:48.930> off<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:49.470> that's<00:05:50.720> and

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
and it's hard to get off so that's and

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.310 
and it's hard to get off so that's and
it<00:05:51.840> also<00:05:51.990> has<00:05:52.260> a<00:05:52.290> really<00:05:52.680> good<00:05:52.980> i'm<00:05:54.320> handle

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
it also has a really good i'm handle

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.690 
it also has a really good i'm handle
that<00:05:56.190> has<00:05:56.340> two<00:05:56.610> bolts<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:57.620> so<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:59.460> doesn't

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
that has two bolts on it so it doesn't

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.480 
that has two bolts on it so it doesn't
snap<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.390> but<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.140> doesn't<00:06:01.650> stop<00:06:01.920> as<00:06:02.130> much<00:06:02.160> as
