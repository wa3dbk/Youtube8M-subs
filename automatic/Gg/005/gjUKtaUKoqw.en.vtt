00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of the oil-based lubricants do a good

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.889 
of the oil-based lubricants do a good
job<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.890> making<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.790> stuff<00:00:39.059> stick<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.719> your

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
job of making that stuff stick to your

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.040 
job of making that stuff stick to your
your<00:00:40.469> particular<00:00:40.890> firearm<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.840> why<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
your particular firearm so that's why I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.500 
your particular firearm so that's why I
started<00:00:43.590> using<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.309> century<00:00:45.000> solution

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
started using the century solution

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.340 
started using the century solution
smooth<00:00:45.870> coat<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> century<00:00:48.930> solution

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
smooth coat now the century solution

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.910 
smooth coat now the century solution
smooth<00:00:49.649> coat<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> dry<00:00:50.690> lubricant<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.260> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
smooth coat is a dry lubricant so it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
smooth coat is a dry lubricant so it's
basically<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:54.210> graphite<00:00:54.840> type<00:00:55.140> substance

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
basically like a graphite type substance

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
basically like a graphite type substance
that<00:00:56.449> puts<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.629> dry<00:00:58.320> shield<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> moving

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that puts a dry shield on the moving

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.510 
that puts a dry shield on the moving
parts<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.539> firearm<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.219> don't<00:01:02.399> get

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
parts of your firearm so you don't get

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
parts of your firearm so you don't get
any<00:01:02.579> friction<00:01:03.329> directly<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> metal<00:01:04.769> parts

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
any friction directly on the metal parts

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.600 
any friction directly on the metal parts

leak through and some of these chemicals

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959 
leak through and some of these chemicals
can<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.829> toxic<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> gives

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.620 
your washing machine so let's go ahead
and<00:02:12.130> get<00:02:12.190> started<00:02:12.490> on<00:02:12.790> another<00:02:13.090> application

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and get started on another application

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.610 
and get started on another application
of<00:02:13.930> using<00:02:14.350> us<00:02:14.500> now<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> typical

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
of using us now this is the typical

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
of using us now this is the typical
bottle<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.400> find<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
two-part me a point 5 ounce bottle here

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.410 
two-part me a point 5 ounce bottle here
but<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.010> little<00:02:24.580> bottle<00:02:24.850> will<00:02:24.970> last<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.390> very

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
but this little bottle will last a very

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690 
but this little bottle will last a very
very<00:02:26.230> long<00:02:26.470> time<00:02:26.530> because<00:02:27.250> you're<00:02:27.400> only<00:02:27.490> going

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to put a small application on what

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.490 
to put a small application on what
you're<00:02:30.040> gonna<00:02:30.130> use<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.959> first<00:02:32.170> thing<00:02:32.350> that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you have to do is shake this up very

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.330 
you have to do is shake this up very
well<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.300> also<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.320> want<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> make<00:02:35.800> as<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> side

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
well and also I want to make as a side

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220 
well and also I want to make as a side
note<00:02:36.370> too<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.569> also<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.900> bore

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
note too that this is also a bore

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.680 
note too that this is also a bore
treatment<00:02:38.770> as<00:02:38.920> well<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.300> can<00:02:40.570> actually

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
treatment as well so you can actually

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.860 
treatment as well so you can actually
put<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> small<00:02:41.470> amount<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.160> on<00:02:42.570> inside<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
put a small amount of this on inside the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.380 
put a small amount of this on inside the
barrel<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.500> your<00:02:44.530> gun<00:02:44.680> actually<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.850> this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
barrel of your gun actually and this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.680 
barrel of your gun actually and this
will<00:02:46.540> reduce<00:02:46.660> friction<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:48.010> claimed<00:02:48.310> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
will reduce friction and it's claimed to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.110 
will reduce friction and it's claimed to
increase<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> feet<00:02:50.410> per<00:02:50.560> second<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.130> accuracy

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
increase a feet per second and accuracy

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.670 
increase a feet per second and accuracy
and<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.330> weapons<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.080> haven't<00:02:53.350> tried<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and your weapons now I haven't tried it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.009 
and your weapons now I haven't tried it
for<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.130> but<00:02:54.459> all<00:02:55.030> accounts<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.750> it

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
for that but all accounts that it

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.810 
for that but all accounts that it
actually<00:02:56.709> does<00:02:56.890> do<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.489> does<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> very

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
actually does do that and does a very

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.229 
actually does do that and does a very
fine<00:02:58.420> job<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.780> doing<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.489> what<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.000> want<00:03:01.180> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
do is actually put on this applicator

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
tip here and this will dispense a very

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.020 
tip here and this will dispense a very
fine<00:03:06.400> amount<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:08.220> lubrication<00:03:09.220> onto<00:03:09.910> your

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
fine amount of the lubrication onto your

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.600 
fine amount of the lubrication onto your
weapon<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:11.010> basically<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.100> just<00:03:12.160> want<00:03:12.370> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
weapon and basically you just want to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.670 
weapon and basically you just want to
apply<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.209> any<00:03:13.600> surface<00:03:13.959> that's<00:03:14.350> going<00:03:14.590> to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
apply it to any surface that's going to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.090 
apply it to any surface that's going to
create<00:03:15.040> metal<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.180> metal<00:03:16.420> contact<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> it's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
create metal and metal contact and it's

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.600 
create metal and metal contact and it's
a<00:03:18.190> little<00:03:18.370> bit<00:03:18.610> easier<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.120> apply<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.049> on<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
a little bit easier to apply this on a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.380 
a little bit easier to apply this on a
blue<00:03:21.610> or<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:23.070> black<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.280> framed<00:03:24.549> pistol

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
because you can actually see it go on as

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.110 
because you can actually see it go on as
a<00:03:27.820> nice<00:03:28.060> nice<00:03:28.989> silver<00:03:29.739> coat<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:30.790> it

a nice nice silver coat and then it
takes<00:03:31.299> about<00:03:31.450> two<00:03:31.780> minutes<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.170> dry<00:03:32.530> takes<00:03:33.370> two

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
takes about two minutes to dry takes two

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.240 
takes about two minutes to dry takes two
hours<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.480> fully<00:03:34.780> cure<00:03:35.260> but<00:03:35.590> once<00:03:35.829> it's<00:03:36.040> fully

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
hours to fully cure but once it's fully

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.390 
hours to fully cure but once it's fully
cured<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.450> have<00:03:37.810> very<00:03:38.260> good<00:03:38.500> protection<00:03:38.709> here

and that's it now one thing that you
want<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.570> make<00:04:24.690> sure<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.080> your<00:04:25.440> gun<00:04:25.680> has

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
want to make sure is that your gun has

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.010 
want to make sure is that your gun has
been<00:04:26.100> thoroughly<00:04:26.490> cleaned<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.270> decreased

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
been thoroughly cleaned and decreased

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.480 
been thoroughly cleaned and decreased
before<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.650> do<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.790> any<00:04:30.240> grease<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.140> any

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
before you do that so any grease or any

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.680 
before you do that so any grease or any
anything<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.670> is<00:04:33.090> going<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.330> prevent

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
anything like that is going to prevent

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
anything like that is going to prevent
good<00:04:34.200> adherence<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:35.810> for<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.020> little<00:04:37.500> powder

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
good adherence to for this little powder

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.400 
good adherence to for this little powder
it<00:04:38.490> actually<00:04:38.970> goes<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.330> with<00:04:39.540> an<00:04:39.630> alcohol<00:04:40.110> base

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
it actually goes on with an alcohol base

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.920 
it actually goes on with an alcohol base
so<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:40.980> flammable<00:04:41.370> when<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.390> first<00:04:42.630> apply

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
so it is flammable when you first apply

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.230 
so it is flammable when you first apply
it<00:04:43.050> but<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.470> alcohol<00:04:43.890> evaporates<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.850> then

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
it but the alcohol evaporates and then

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.080 
it but the alcohol evaporates and then
you're<00:04:45.450> fine<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.740> after<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.430> do<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.640> and
