00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 since last year ago 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.800
 in our village a former grand ya 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.100
 two farms that are converted to 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.100
 organic 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.199
 the 311 or bio and something we change 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.000
 the techniques we change lille the way 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.460
 of libÃ© purpose how to exploit 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.270
 but the hardest thing to do is 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 change in his head 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.649
 we 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.469
 I started asking myself the question 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.250
 why not organic farming 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.440
 so 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.550
 speaking of neighborhood it was a big 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.750
 word organic farming 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 it scares a lot of people 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.360
 we do not know 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.040
 in sounds and china there are 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.480
 always with China we are asked 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 to work the natural elements 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 it is the elements that are not doing 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.460
 watch out for me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.760
 this terroir follows them 1 and climate with the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 temperature of contempt the adult who is going 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.530
 condition certain titles 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 verification of microbial cities that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 come behind we will measure after 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 on the harvest of this wheat that presents 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.340
 facts in terms of performance and in 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.510
 terms of quality of its cutlery 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.510
 of intercropping 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.510
 e 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.799
 if we can just stay on 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.569
 short circuits with for sale 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.980
 directly to the consumer without 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.790
 by intermediaries we are that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.790
 what he wanted 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.050
 I would not have more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.390
 work elsewhere I always said 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.959
 it may be peasant today I 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.959
 am a painter 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 and today I think I have 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.680
 to find my balance 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.950
 the way in the video I found my 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 balanced
