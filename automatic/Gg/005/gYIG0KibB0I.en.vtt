the bearing can sit you know right and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.030 
the bearing can sit you know right and
still<00:01:47.729> spin<00:01:47.970> freely<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.680> wash<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
still spin freely and then just wash on

altogether<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.970> course<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:55.229> simply<00:01:55.500> does

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
altogether and of course it simply does

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.569 
altogether and of course it simply does
as<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:58.399> intended

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
as as intended

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.929 
as as intended
it's<00:02:00.509> pretty<00:02:00.780> tight<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:02.430> take<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> pretty

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's pretty tight to take it pretty

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's pretty tight to take it pretty
close<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.420> doesn't<00:02:03.840> touch<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.520> hopefully

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
close but doesn't touch and hopefully

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.010 
close but doesn't touch and hopefully
their<00:02:05.729> belt<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.090> last<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.570> bit<00:02:06.600> longer<00:02:06.750> than

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
their belt will last a bit longer than

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.100 
their belt will last a bit longer than
the<00:02:07.229> last<00:02:07.350> guy<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> saw<00:02:08.099> who<00:02:09.000> seemed<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> last<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the last guy I saw who seemed to last I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.350 
the last guy I saw who seemed to last I
think<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.379> was<00:02:10.500> done<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.860> two<00:02:11.039> hours<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.819> carpet

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
think it was done in two hours on carpet

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.020 
think it was done in two hours on carpet
which<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
which is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.550 
which is
abysmal<00:02:15.390> yeah<00:02:16.390> otherwise<00:02:16.720> minds<00:02:17.260> are<00:02:17.410> pretty

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
abysmal yeah otherwise minds are pretty

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989

call<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.040> white<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.610> guess<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.270> force<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.170> each

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
call it white I guess so force to each

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
call it white I guess so force to each
corner<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:10.360> amazingly<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.320> best<00:03:12.070> thing

probably would ya Sakura recommend it
for<00:03:50.230> anyone<00:03:51.630> but<00:03:52.630> as<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.230> beginner<00:03:53.470> myself<00:03:54.070> I'm

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
for anyone but as a beginner myself I'm

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.340 
for anyone but as a beginner myself I'm
funny<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.790> little<00:03:55.000> bit<00:03:55.090> difficult<00:03:55.269> with<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
funny a little bit difficult with the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.960 
funny a little bit difficult with the
can<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.380> see<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.940> heavily<00:04:00.940> rear<00:04:01.180> biased<00:04:01.630> ratio<00:04:02.970> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
can I see a heavily rear biased ratio so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.670 
can I see a heavily rear biased ratio so
I'm<00:04:04.120> looking<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.540> fix<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:05.049> hopefully<00:04:05.530> to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
I'm looking to fix that hopefully to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.390 
I'm looking to fix that hopefully to
reaches<00:04:06.040> down<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.700> maybe<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.799> 60/40<00:04:08.799> split<00:04:08.829> I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
reaches down to maybe a 60/40 split I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.920 
reaches down to maybe a 60/40 split I
think<00:04:09.549> it's<00:04:09.670> about<00:04:09.760> 66<00:04:10.420> percent<00:04:10.480> RIA<00:04:11.940> 33<00:04:12.940> 34

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
think it's about 66 percent RIA 33 34

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.069 
think it's about 66 percent RIA 33 34
percent<00:04:14.260> from<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.239> maybe<00:04:16.239> round<00:04:16.479> yeah<00:04:16.870> might

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
percent from and maybe round yeah might

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.319 
percent from and maybe round yeah might
have<00:04:17.200> around<00:04:17.350> 58<00:04:17.890> percent<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:19.030> it's<00:04:19.209> a

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
have around 58 percent I think it's a

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.650 
have around 58 percent I think it's a
can't<00:04:19.630> see<00:04:19.870> ratio<00:04:20.260> about<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.530> 1.5<00:04:21.539> should<00:04:22.539> be

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
can't see ratio about a 1.5 should be

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.659 
can't see ratio about a 1.5 should be
been<00:04:22.840> firmly<00:04:23.110> back<00:04:23.349> in<00:04:23.500> designing<00:04:23.770> more<00:04:24.430> than

I<00:04:24.700> can<00:04:24.789> handle

I can handle

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.620 
I can handle

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
but I wouldn't turn I wouldn't say to

but I wouldn't turn I wouldn't say to
anyone<00:04:28.050> turn<00:04:28.290> away<00:04:28.470> from<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.890> kit<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.970> when

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
anyone turn away from this kit so when

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.940 
anyone turn away from this kit so when
you're<00:04:30.240> building<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:31.620> wait<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.860> little

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
you're building it just wait a little

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.510 
you're building it just wait a little
bit<00:04:32.160> longer<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:33.450> new<00:04:34.010> tox<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.190> come<00:04:35.340> out

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
bit longer for the new tox to come out

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
bit longer for the new tox to come out
and<00:04:36.080> then<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.320> change<00:04:38.070> up<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.660> two<00:04:39.870> and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
and then just change up the two and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.700 
and then just change up the two and
enjoy<00:04:42.890> alright<00:04:43.890> thanks<00:04:44.250> for<00:04:44.280> watching
