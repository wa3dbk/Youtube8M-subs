00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that that when you are breathing in you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.929 
that that when you are breathing in you
are<00:01:24.689> lifting<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.320> shoulders<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.729> this

is<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> common<00:01:27.810> stress<00:01:28.350> response<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.400> often

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
is a common stress response that's often

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
is a common stress response that's often
associated<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
associated with what we know is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.520 
associated with what we know is
paradoxical<00:01:32.759> breathing<00:01:33.299> which<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
paradoxical breathing which means that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.580 
paradoxical breathing which means that
we've<00:01:35.390> unlearned<00:01:36.390> how<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> breathe<00:01:37.290> correctly

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
we've unlearned how to breathe correctly

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.910 
we've unlearned how to breathe correctly
and<00:01:38.490> oftentimes<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.900> people<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.710> they

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and oftentimes what people do is they

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
and oftentimes what people do is they
use<00:01:40.950> their<00:01:41.490> secondary<00:01:42.060> breathing<00:01:42.630> muscles

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
use their secondary breathing muscles

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
use their secondary breathing muscles
which<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.979> traps<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.820> upper<00:01:45.180> chest

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
which are the traps that upper chest

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
which are the traps that upper chest
muscles<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> neck<00:01:46.530> muscles<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.189> why

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
muscles the neck muscles and that's why

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 
muscles the neck muscles and that's why
we<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.390> kinks<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> our<00:01:49.170> neck<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we get that the kinks in our neck and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
we get that the kinks in our neck and
then<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.159> next<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.299> everything<00:01:51.570> happens

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
then right next and everything happens

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
then right next and everything happens
because<00:01:52.350> we're<00:01:52.500> using<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> secondary

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because we're using the secondary

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.649 
because we're using the secondary
muscles<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:56.399> basically<00:01:56.579> breathe<00:01:57.240> instead

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
muscles to to basically breathe instead

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.560 
muscles to to basically breathe instead
of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> primary<00:01:58.500> muscle<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> which<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of the primary muscle and which is the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.679 
of the primary muscle and which is the

I'm being very dramatic but if you did
this<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.740> test<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.520> watched

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
this little test and you watched

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.270 
this little test and you watched
yourself<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.570> mirror<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.170> might<00:02:18.860> be

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
yourself in the mirror you might be

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340 
yourself in the mirror you might be
curious<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:20.420> do<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.900> as<00:02:21.110> well

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350

and<00:02:21.590> then<00:02:22.160> let's<00:02:22.790> look<00:02:23.000> at<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.330> normal

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
and then let's look at what normal

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.900 
and then let's look at what normal
breathing<00:02:24.170> deep<00:02:24.650> diaphragmatic<00:02:25.280> breathing

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
breathing deep diaphragmatic breathing

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.060 
breathing deep diaphragmatic breathing
should<00:02:26.360> look<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:26.630> okay<00:02:27.140> Ashley<00:02:27.590> if<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.980> were

inflating<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.980> balloon<00:02:43.010> out<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.650> it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
inflating a balloon out and that's it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.310

sounds pretty great so definitely some

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.670 
sounds pretty great so definitely some
motivation<00:04:02.900> there<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.170> learn<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.560> breathe

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
motivation there to learn to breathe

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.140 
motivation there to learn to breathe
correctly<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.430> get<00:04:04.640> all<00:04:04.760> those<00:04:04.850> health
