00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.500 

so<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:12.920> can<00:01:13.100> use<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.430> scoop<00:01:13.790> rescue<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.360> these

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
so you can use the scoop rescue in these

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.720 
so you can use the scoop rescue in these
conditions<00:01:14.780> as<00:01:15.170> well<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.160> this<00:01:16.280> case<00:01:16.520> is

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
conditions as well so in this case is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.180 
conditions as well so in this case is
janice's<00:01:17.270> left<00:01:18.050> shoulder<00:01:18.620> that's<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.830> bachelor

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
janice's left shoulder that's a bachelor

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.330 
janice's left shoulder that's a bachelor
I'm<00:01:19.910> getting<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> board<00:01:20.420> onto<00:01:20.630> its<00:01:20.930> site<00:01:21.340> she

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
I'm getting the board onto its site she

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.260 
I'm getting the board onto its site she
won<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.460> second<00:01:23.150> legs<00:01:23.390> enter<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.930> cockpit<00:01:25.270> so

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
won a second legs enter the cockpit so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.290 
won a second legs enter the cockpit so
that<00:01:26.450> worked<00:01:26.780> remarkably<00:01:27.620> well<00:01:28.130> why<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:28.970> say

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
that worked remarkably well why I say

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.510 
that worked remarkably well why I say

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.600 
managed to get quite a lot of rope off
just<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.090> his<00:02:20.329> knife<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.980> couldn't<00:02:22.310> free

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
just with his knife but we couldn't free

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.729 
just with his knife but we couldn't free
it<00:02:22.730> completely<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.599> at<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.870> moment<00:02:24.079> that<00:02:24.410> boat

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
it completely so at the moment that boat

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.190 
it completely so at the moment that boat
is<00:02:24.769> he's<00:02:25.670> waiting<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.180> low<00:02:26.510> water<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
is he's waiting for low water and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.690 
is he's waiting for low water and
hopefully<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.130> was<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.489> beached

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
hopefully it was going to be beached

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.089 
hopefully it was going to be beached
high<00:02:29.000> enough<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:30.140> Jack<00:02:30.769> would<00:02:30.950> come

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
high enough and then Jack would come

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.210 
high enough and then Jack would come
along<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.370> unwind<00:02:32.239> or<00:02:32.510> hacksaw<00:02:33.019> off<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.010> last

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
along and unwind or hacksaw off the last

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.550 
along and unwind or hacksaw off the last
bit<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.519> rope<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.269> was<00:02:35.450> wound<00:02:35.900> around<00:02:36.170> his

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
bit of rope that was wound around his

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.640 
bit of rope that was wound around his
prop<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.750> reward<00:02:39.079> for<00:02:39.170> doing<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.590> for

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
prop the reward for doing that for

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.160 
prop the reward for doing that for
Janice<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:40.220> big<00:02:40.670> bag<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.910> prawns<00:02:41.299> which<00:02:41.930> right
