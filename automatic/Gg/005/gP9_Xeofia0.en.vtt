hello today we are going to show you how

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.309 
hello today we are going to show you how
to<00:00:03.360> set<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.810> timing<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.620> Suzuki<00:00:05.040> LTC<00:00:06.000> 430<00:00:06.960> G

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
to set the timing on a Suzuki LTC 430 G

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.270 
to set the timing on a Suzuki LTC 430 G
434<00:00:08.250> 440<00:00:09.000> big<00:00:09.389> bowl<00:00:09.660> kit<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.040> same

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
434 440 big bowl kit it's the same

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.430 
434 440 big bowl kit it's the same
procedure<00:00:11.570> I'm<00:00:12.570> uploading<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.230> video

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
procedure I'm uploading that video

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.799 
procedure I'm uploading that video
because<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.190> took<00:00:14.340> me<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.580> while<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.570> first

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
because it took me a while the first

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.450 
because it took me a while the first
time<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.230> find<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> information<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
time to find the information on the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.179 
time to find the information on the
internet<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.150> I'll<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:19.170> show<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.710> guys<00:00:19.980> how

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
internet so I'll just show you guys how

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
internet so I'll just show you guys how
to<00:00:20.220> set<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> timing<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.900> left<00:00:22.109> side

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to set the timing on the left side

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.980 
to set the timing on the left side
you're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:23.699> open<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.390> cap<00:00:24.630> on

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you're going your open a little cap on

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.120 
you're going your open a little cap on
the<00:00:25.529> magnet<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:28.740> need<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the magnet right here and you need to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
the magnet right here and you need to
bring<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:30.980> until<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> kind<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
bring it until you see that it's kind of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
bring it until you see that it's kind of
like<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.350> says<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> t<00:00:38.129> NE<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.219> has<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> line<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
like it says a t NE has a has a line so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
like it says a t NE has a has a line so
this<00:00:42.570> line<00:00:42.980> needs<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.160> line<00:00:44.780> with<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.530> knob

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
this line needs to line with this knob

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.049 
this line needs to line with this knob
right<00:00:47.399> here

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
right here

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.959 
right here
so<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.289> needs<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.829> perfect<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so this needs to be perfect now the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.150 
so this needs to be perfect now the
first<00:00:51.449> step<00:00:52.640> then<00:00:53.640> without<00:00:54.440> moving<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
first step then without moving the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.709 
first step then without moving the
piston<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:59.340> go<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.949> side

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
piston at all you go to the right side

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.429 
piston at all you go to the right side
and<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> exhaust<00:01:04.619> cam<00:01:06.049> right<00:01:07.049> here

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and now on the exhaust cam right here

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.149 
and now on the exhaust cam right here
this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> exhaust<00:01:08.310> cam<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.710> numbers

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this is the exhaust cam you have numbers

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.609 
this is the exhaust cam you have numbers
one<00:01:11.750> right<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> three

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
one right here one two and three

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
one right here one two and three
okay<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> bring<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.630> until<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.020> be

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
okay you need to bring one until to be

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 
okay you need to bring one until to be
parallel<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.790> top<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> cylinder

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
parallel with the top of the cylinder

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.700 
parallel with the top of the cylinder
head<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> two<00:01:22.590> facing<00:01:23.520> straight<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.710> then

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
head and two facing straight up and then

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.929 
head and two facing straight up and then
from<00:01:25.979> -<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> full<00:01:28.979> spin<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.610> here

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
from - this is the full spin right here

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
from - this is the full spin right here
and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.650> need<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> count<00:01:32.220> 15

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then from there you need to count 15

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
and then from there you need to count 15
