00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.550 

and<00:01:48.610> what<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.970> does

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.230 

as<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.310> coached<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.790> bees<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> sugar

as it coached the bees with the sugar

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.480 
as it coached the bees with the sugar
and<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> stimulates<00:01:58.710> their<00:01:58.979> grooming<00:02:00.080> and

it coached the bottom of the mites feet

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.340 
it coached the bottom of the mites feet
so<00:02:05.880> he<00:02:06.060> doesn't<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.170> don't

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so he doesn't get there so they don't

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.160 
so he doesn't get there so they don't
get<00:02:07.530> good<00:02:07.560> purchase<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.750> happens

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
get good purchase and then what happens

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.190 
get good purchase and then what happens
is<00:02:11.150> when<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> bees<00:02:12.510> groom<00:02:12.930> themselves<00:02:15.200> they

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
is when the bees groom themselves they

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.130 
is when the bees groom themselves they
knock<00:02:16.440> device<00:02:16.890> down<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> mites<00:02:18.870> get

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
knock device down and then the mites get

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
knock device down and then the mites get
