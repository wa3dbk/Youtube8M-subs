00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
so we can keep that going well I guess

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.760 
so we can keep that going well I guess

number two yeah bro Petroleum them boat
to<00:03:27.560> oh<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.430> actually<00:03:28.580> they<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.209> be<00:03:29.420> three

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
to oh and actually they have to be three

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.590 
to oh and actually they have to be three
because<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.130> real<00:03:31.340> boat<00:03:31.700> petroleum<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.450> right

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
because the real boat petroleum is right

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.040 
because the real boat petroleum is right
down<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.020> street<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:34.180> that'd<00:03:35.180> be<00:03:35.450> double<00:03:35.870> one

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
down the street and that'd be double one

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.920 
down the street and that'd be double one
and<00:03:36.410> number<00:03:36.560> two<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:37.430> way<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.300> this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
and number two is on my way out so this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.620 
and number two is on my way out so this
would<00:03:39.200> have<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.680> number<00:03:39.980> three<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.480> then

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
would have to be number three and then

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.460 
would have to be number three and then
we<00:03:41.750> have<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.080> plastics<00:03:42.770> transfer<00:03:43.400> company

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
we have the plastics transfer company

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.729 
we have the plastics transfer company
now<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.830> we<00:03:46.280> have<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.820> line<00:03:47.720> coming<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.410> back

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
now and we have the line coming on back

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.410 
now and we have the line coming on back
into<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:50.480> yard<00:03:51.550> this<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.760> kind<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.090> where<00:03:53.270> we

into the yard this is kind of where we

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.260 
into the yard this is kind of where we
were<00:03:53.660> before

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
were before

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.979

more<00:04:05.450> than<00:04:05.690> we<00:04:05.840> probably<00:04:06.110> will<00:04:06.590> ever<00:04:06.860> use<00:04:06.980> but

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
more than we probably will ever use but

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.590 
more than we probably will ever use but
anyway<00:04:08.350> we<00:04:09.350> do<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.910> large<00:04:10.910> quantity<00:04:11.330> of

anyway we do have a large quantity of
motor<00:04:11.900> power<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.860> due<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.130> area<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.610> where

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
to a box factory Louisiana Delta took it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.470 
to a box factory Louisiana Delta took it
over<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:34.070> Box<00:04:34.310> factory<00:04:34.820> closed<00:04:35.150> back<00:04:35.450> a

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
over and the Box factory closed back a

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.560 
over and the Box factory closed back a
few<00:04:35.780> years<00:04:35.840> ago<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.710> basically<00:04:37.570> there's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
few years ago and basically there's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.680 
few years ago and basically there's
pretty<00:04:39.410> much<00:04:39.470> been<00:04:39.920> it's<00:04:40.460> abandoned<00:04:41.150> now<00:04:41.300> but

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
pretty much been it's abandoned now but

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.220 
pretty much been it's abandoned now but
not<00:04:41.870> officially<00:04:42.500> because<00:04:43.930> there<00:04:44.930> has<00:04:45.200> been

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
not officially because there has been

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.130 
not officially because there has been
some<00:04:45.800> talk<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.100> putting<00:04:46.940> another<00:04:47.330> industry<00:04:47.960> in

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
some talk of putting another industry in

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
some talk of putting another industry in
there<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:50.270> anyway<00:04:50.570> that's<00:04:51.350> where<00:04:51.680> we<00:04:51.860> are

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.540 

progress<00:04:55.160> keeps<00:04:55.520> going<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:59.180> we'll<00:04:59.930> get<00:05:00.140> it

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
progress keeps going and we'll get it

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.950 
progress keeps going and we'll get it
see<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:01.610> we<00:05:01.700> can<00:05:01.850> get<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.000> train<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.510> run<00:05:02.660> here<00:05:02.930> in

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
see if we can get a train to run here in

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.890 
see if we can get a train to run here in
a<00:05:03.050> second<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.670> pick<00:05:04.880> someone<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.240> dozen<00:05:05.750> or

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
a second so you pick someone a dozen or

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:54.170 
a second so you pick someone a dozen or
so<00:05:05.930> okay

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:22.059 

it<00:05:55.180> could<00:05:55.480> be<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:56.380> old<00:05:56.639> dirty<00:05:57.639> track<00:05:58.030> syndrome

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.270 

so<00:06:23.069> in<00:06:23.400> this<00:06:23.550> part<00:06:23.849> of<00:06:23.909> the<00:06:23.999> world<00:06:25.039> if<00:06:26.039> you're

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
so in this part of the world if you're

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.360 
so in this part of the world if you're
going<00:06:26.610> to<00:06:26.849> have<00:06:27.210> an<00:06:27.360> industry<00:06:27.930> you<00:06:28.310> have<00:06:29.310> a

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
going to have an industry you have a

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.679 
going to have an industry you have a
sugar<00:06:29.699> client<00:06:30.270> plant

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:30.689 
sugar client plant
