00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
we looked at in an earlier video you've

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.380 
we looked at in an earlier video you've
still<00:00:30.259> got<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.679> g-force<00:00:31.519> tuning<00:00:31.909> system<00:00:32.210> so

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
still got the g-force tuning system so

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.810 
still got the g-force tuning system so
this<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.750> upgraded<00:00:33.550> chronicle<00:00:34.550> tuning

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
this is the upgraded chronicle tuning

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.099 
this is the upgraded chronicle tuning
system<00:00:35.149> that's<00:00:35.300> featured<00:00:35.600> on<00:00:35.690> everything

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
system that's featured on everything

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.040 
system that's featured on everything
from<00:00:36.230> 2014<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.160> before<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.690> kind<00:00:38.899> of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
from 2014 and before this is kind of

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.860 
from 2014 and before this is kind of
basically<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.710> much<00:00:40.489> much<00:00:41.059> more<00:00:41.480> improved

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
basically a much much more improved

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.900 
basically a much much more improved
system<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:43.039> much<00:00:43.219> quicker<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:43.699> more

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
system so it's much quicker it's more

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.930 
system so it's much quicker it's more
intelligent<00:00:44.449> it's<00:00:45.410> much<00:00:45.769> easier<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.309> use<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
intelligent it's much easier to use and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.970 
intelligent it's much easier to use and
and<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:47.719> just<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.199> lot<00:00:48.320> quicker<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.679> fact<00:00:48.890> you

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and it's just a lot quicker in fact you

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.290 
and it's just a lot quicker in fact you
only<00:00:49.039> really<00:00:49.370> only<00:00:49.609> have<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.850> strum<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.149> once

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
only really only have to strum it once

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.849 
only really only have to strum it once
and<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:50.539> kind<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:51.320> does<00:00:51.620> what<00:00:51.800> it

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
and it kind of it just does what it

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.860 
and it kind of it just does what it
needs<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.160> do<00:00:52.280> you've<00:00:52.879> also<00:00:53.059> got<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.480> kind<00:00:53.750> of

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
needs to do you've also got the kind of

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.599 
needs to do you've also got the kind of

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.469 
the sort of sanded and kind of buffed
fretboard<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.030> kind<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.299> new

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
fretboard so it's a kind of new

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.609 
fretboard so it's a kind of new
technique<00:01:56.869> they're<00:01:57.020> doing<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.439> fret

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
technique they're doing on the fret

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.889 
technique they're doing on the fret
board<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.759> pole<00:01:59.000> dots<00:01:59.299> as<00:01:59.509> well<00:01:59.659> so

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
board and the pole dots as well so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.359 
board and the pole dots as well so
you've<00:02:00.020> got<00:02:00.109> some<00:02:00.289> nice<00:02:00.409> cosmetic<00:02:00.979> changes

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
you've got some nice cosmetic changes

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.130 
you've got some nice cosmetic changes
and<00:02:01.549> some<00:02:02.149> really<00:02:02.450> practical<00:02:02.630> playing

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and some really practical playing

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.889 
and some really practical playing
changes<00:02:03.619> as<00:02:03.740> well<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.000> slim<00:02:05.240> taper<00:02:05.539> neck

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
changes as well with the slim taper neck

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.859 
changes as well with the slim taper neck
it<00:02:06.350> still<00:02:06.649> feels<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.340> classic<00:02:07.640> 60s<00:02:08.300> SG

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
it still feels like that classic 60s SG

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.080 
it still feels like that classic 60s SG
as<00:02:08.990> well<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.950> still<00:02:10.190> get<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.460> same<00:02:10.700> feel

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
as well so you still get the same feel

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.030 
as well so you still get the same feel
that<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.450> always<00:02:11.750> did<00:02:12.019> so<00:02:12.530> why<00:02:12.650> don't<00:02:12.769> we<00:02:12.800> plug

and obviously as I said from the added
mass<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> rosewood<00:02:36.260> board<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.370> can

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
mass on the rosewood board and you can

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.830 
mass on the rosewood board and you can

between<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.140> nice<00:02:39.319> bait<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.010> know<00:02:40.129> a<00:02:40.160> lot<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
between a nice bait you know a lot of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920 
between a nice bait you know a lot of
bass<00:02:40.550> coming<00:02:40.819> through<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.209> I've<00:02:41.420> seen<00:02:41.569> like<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
bass coming through but I've seen like a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.900 
bass coming through but I've seen like a
lot<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.230> treble<00:02:42.920> coming<00:02:43.160> from<00:02:43.310> those<00:02:43.489> pickups

lot of treble coming from those pickups

00:02:43.910 --> 00:03:11.990 
lot of treble coming from those pickups
