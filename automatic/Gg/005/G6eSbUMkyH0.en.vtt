great it's box stock so far except for
the<00:01:24.299> pipe<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:29.390> no<00:01:30.390> no<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> guess<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.740> 50<00:01:32.159> miles

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369

the pipe and no no I guess what 50 miles
on<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:35.460> runs<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:37.009> think

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

I've<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> about<00:01:39.030> 35<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.700> down

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I've had it up to about 35 and back down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.249 
I've had it up to about 35 and back down
