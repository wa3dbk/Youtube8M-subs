as<00:00:29.220> shown<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:30.119> let's<00:00:30.720> design<00:00:30.990> jelling<00:00:31.320> calls

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
as shown here let's design jelling calls

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.799 
as shown here let's design jelling calls
for<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.910> sources<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.719> on

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
for two water sources but if you're on

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.850 
for two water sources but if you're on
scam<00:00:34.020> block<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
scam block that's not really going to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
scam block that's not really going to
work<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.820> i've<00:00:36.059> modified<00:00:36.329> slightly<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
work so i've modified slightly so that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 
work so i've modified slightly so that
you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> use<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.770> source<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.879> water<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you can use one source of water as you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.350 
you can use one source of water as you
see<00:00:39.870> above<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.820> you've<00:00:41.969> seen<00:00:42.180> the

I've used stone bricks here purely for
aesthetic<00:00:59.340> purposes<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.080> layers

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
aesthetic purposes the first two layers

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
aesthetic purposes the first two layers
are<00:01:10.409> quite<00:01:10.560> simple<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.070> seen<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.700> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
are quite simple as seen here I just

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
are quite simple as seen here I just
build<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> outer<00:01:13.170> shell<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
build them up as the outer shell of the

cobblestone generator the inside as seen

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
cobblestone generator the inside as seen
here<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.580> hold<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> lava<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.930> again<00:01:19.229> it's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
here will hold the lava so again it's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
here will hold the lava so again it's
incredibly<00:01:20.009> important<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.670> use

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
incredibly important that you do not use

cobblestone generator although really
this<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.910> pretty<00:01:41.150> basic<00:01:41.330> form<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:42.020> does

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
this is a pretty basic form it does

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.990 
this is a pretty basic form it does
require<00:01:42.590> two<00:01:42.950> water<00:01:43.160> sources<00:01:43.400> for<00:01:43.700> those<00:01:43.880> of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
water so we're going to do is we're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.040 
water so we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.400> modify<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.510> uses<00:01:50.660> only

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
going to modify it so that it uses only

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:07.330 
going to modify it so that it uses only
one<00:01:51.440> source<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.460> water

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.200 

so<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.490> go<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.910> even<00:02:08.940> working

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
so there you go not even working

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.300 
so there you go not even working
cobblestone<00:02:09.780> generator<00:02:09.980> it'll<00:02:10.980> produce

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
cobblestone generator it'll produce

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
cobblestone generator it'll produce
infinite<00:02:11.640> called<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> stone<00:02:12.300> using<00:02:12.570> only<00:02:12.840> one

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
infinite called the stone using only one

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890 
infinite called the stone using only one
source<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.680> lava<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.340> source<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.700> water<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.780> me

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
source of lava one source of water so me

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420 
source of lava one source of water so me
next<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> take<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> look<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> basic

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
next time I take a look from the basic

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.080 
next time I take a look from the basic
of<00:02:17.610> vanilla<00:02:18.120> crops<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.440> Minecraft<00:02:20.100> thanks

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
of vanilla crops in Minecraft thanks

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.240
