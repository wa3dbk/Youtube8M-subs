what we call epa and DHA the epa oils

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
what we call epa and DHA the epa oils
are<00:01:02.850> great<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.300> inflammation<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.589> DHA<00:01:05.189> good

are great for inflammation the DHA good
for<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> brain<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.810> benefits<00:01:07.260> are

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
for the brain and the benefits are

doesn't<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:11.880> EPA<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.840> DHA<00:01:12.869> we

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
doesn't have that much EPA or DHA we

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
doesn't have that much EPA or DHA we
thought<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.310> thought<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:15.030> why

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
thought it was thought that that's why

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
thought it was thought that that's why
the<00:01:15.420> krill<00:01:15.780> work<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> better<00:01:16.560> source<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the krill work it was a better source of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.969 
the krill work it was a better source of
the<00:01:17.220> EPA<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.909> DHA<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.200> takes<00:01:19.830> about

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the EPA in DHA well it's not takes about

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.050 
the EPA in DHA well it's not takes about
30<00:01:20.580> soft<00:01:21.060> gels<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.229> krill<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.610> what

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
30 soft gels of the krill to get what

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
30 soft gels of the krill to get what
you<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:24.960> 2,000<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> 2,500

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you need which is about 2,000 to 2,500

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
you need which is about 2,000 to 2,500
milligrams<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> EPA<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> DHA<00:01:28.080> combined

to<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> benefits<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.150> need<00:01:30.329> 30<00:01:30.990> pills

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to get the benefits so you need 30 pills

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
to get the benefits so you need 30 pills
of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> krill<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:32.970> get

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
of the krill to get what you would get

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.719 
of the krill to get what you would get
in<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> couple<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.630> capsules<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> fish<00:01:34.590> oil

in a couple of capsules of the fish oil

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
in a couple of capsules of the fish oil
really<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:36.060> cost-effective<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really not cost-effective to do that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
really not cost-effective to do that
the<00:01:38.100> studies<00:01:38.579> show<00:01:38.610> though<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> krill

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the studies show though that the krill

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
the studies show though that the krill
has<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> different<00:01:40.500> target<00:01:41.070> organ<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> that

has a different target organ and that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.580 
has a different target organ and that
seems<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
seems to be and I don't think this is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
seems to be and I don't think this is
the<00:01:43.710> limit<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> krill<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.240> seems<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> be

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the limit of krill but this seems to be

the limit of krill but this seems to be

that the the krill benefits our joints

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.170 
that the the krill benefits our joints
and<00:01:48.869> heals<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> repairs<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.640> cartilage<00:01:51.090> of
