or a bad one

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.400 
or a bad one
the<00:00:07.710> answer<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:09.420> depends<00:00:09.959> on<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the answer is that it depends on the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.249 
the answer is that it depends on the

in<00:01:40.280> fact<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:41.479> way<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.750> increase<00:01:42.140> the

in fact one way to increase the
conductivity<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:43.280> water<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.330> add<00:01:44.510> a

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
conductivity of water is to add a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
teaspoon of salt as we will see now

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.210 
teaspoon of salt as we will see now
let's<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.300> add<00:01:50.570> some<00:01:51.020> salt<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:51.920> tap

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
let's now add some salt to this tap

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's now add some salt to this tap
water<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.850> check<00:01:53.690> its<00:01:53.930> resistance

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.130 

okay<00:02:01.280> let's<00:02:01.520> check<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.940> resistance<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
okay let's check the resistance of this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
okay let's check the resistance of this
top<00:02:03.530> water<00:02:03.800> with<00:02:04.310> salt

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.210 

it<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.360> about<00:02:12.520> some<00:02:13.520> twenty<00:02:14.000> kilo<00:02:14.270> ohms

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
it is about some twenty kilo ohms

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.160 
it is about some twenty kilo ohms
remember<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.430> normal<00:02:17.150> tap<00:02:17.330> water<00:02:17.360> without

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
remember that normal tap water without

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.730 
remember that normal tap water without
the<00:02:18.470> salt<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.790> resistance<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.569> about<00:02:21.050> 200

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
the salt the resistance was about 200

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.650 
the salt the resistance was about 200
kilos<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:23.600> water<00:02:24.170> with<00:02:24.470> salt<00:02:24.680> has<00:02:25.490> ten<00:02:26.330> times

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
kilos this water with salt has ten times

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.949 
kilos this water with salt has ten times
less<00:02:27.080> resistance<00:02:28.180> than<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> other<00:02:29.630> water

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
less resistance than the other water

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.500 
less resistance than the other water
this<00:02:30.800> means<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.520> water<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.910> much<00:02:32.300> more

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
this means that this water is much more

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.040 
this means that this water is much more
conductive

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.160 

now<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.370> these<00:02:41.580> aluminum<00:02:42.210> sheet<00:02:42.450> terminals

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
now in these aluminum sheet terminals

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.160 
now in these aluminum sheet terminals
I'm<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.100> about<00:02:44.730> thirty<00:02:45.420> bolts<00:02:45.960> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I'm going to put about thirty bolts and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:03:07.930 
I'm going to put about thirty bolts and
let's<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.710> what<00:02:46.950> happens

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660 

since<00:03:08.630> our<00:03:08.900> water<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.530> more<00:03:09.800> conductive<00:03:10.400> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
since our water is more conductive it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.470 
since our water is more conductive it
permits<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.390> flow<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.630> electricity<00:03:13.270> if<00:03:14.270> we

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
permits the flow of electricity if we

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.260 
permits the flow of electricity if we
measure<00:03:14.750> with<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.680> voltmeter<00:03:16.040> we<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.910> see<00:03:17.120> that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
measure with a voltmeter we can see that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.670 
measure with a voltmeter we can see that
we<00:03:17.360> have<00:03:17.570> about<00:03:17.810> seven<00:03:18.800> volts<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:20.330> water

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
we have about seven volts in the water

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.170 
we have about seven volts in the water
the<00:03:21.680> voltage<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> function<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the voltage is a function of the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.950 
the voltage is a function of the
distance<00:03:23.560> less<00:03:24.560> distance<00:03:25.510> gives<00:03:26.510> less

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
distance less distance gives less
