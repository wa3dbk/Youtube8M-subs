are infused with natural gharana so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.090 
are infused with natural gharana so
looking<00:00:41.430> onto<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> instant<00:00:42.329> heating<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.780> cups

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
looking onto the instant heating up cups

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.410 
looking onto the instant heating up cups
basically<00:00:44.100> they've<00:00:44.340> sent<00:00:44.579> me<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.090> we

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
does say it's fused with natural gharana

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
does say it's fused with natural gharana
and<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.620> does<00:00:49.800> heat<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> three<00:00:51.360> minutes

they have also sent me the cafe latte
version<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.050> basically<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:55.649> kind

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
version which is basically the same kind

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.610 
version which is basically the same kind
of<00:00:56.100> principle<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.210> heat<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.539> up

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
of principle and to heat these up

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
of principle and to heat these up
basically<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.129> open<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> bottom<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> can

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
basically you open the bottom of the can

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
basically you open the bottom of the can
like<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> standard<00:01:01.109> 10<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.160> carefully

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
like a standard 10 and then carefully

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
like a standard 10 and then carefully
take<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> metal<00:01:03.809> part<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.739> bottom<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
take off the metal part of the bottom of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
take off the metal part of the bottom of
the<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.479> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the can and then you will have this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.649 
the can and then you will have this
plastic<00:01:07.470> container<00:01:07.860> encasing<00:01:08.790> water<00:01:09.030> which

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
plastic container encasing water which

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.149 
plastic container encasing water which
you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> press<00:01:10.229> firmly<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you have to press firmly and it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
you have to press firmly and it
basically<00:01:11.340> breaks<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> water<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
basically breaks the water into the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
basically breaks the water into the
calcium<00:01:13.439> oxide<00:01:13.799> particles<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.939> heat

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
calcium oxide particles which then heat

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
calcium oxide particles which then heat
up<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.840> after<00:01:16.650> approximately<00:01:17.220> three

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
up the can after approximately three

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
up the can after approximately three
minutes<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.119> does<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.869> very

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
minutes this can does actually get very

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
minutes this can does actually get very
very<00:01:19.259> hot<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> give<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
very hot then you just want to give it a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
very hot then you just want to give it a
nice<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.090> shake<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.650> open

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
nice little shake and then you can open

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.850 
nice little shake and then you can open
the<00:01:23.790> hot<00:01:24.030> chocolate<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.990> cafe<00:01:25.259> latte<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the hot chocolate or the cafe latte and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
the hot chocolate or the cafe latte and
start<00:01:26.430> drinking<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.170> quite
