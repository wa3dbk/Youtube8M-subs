00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.939
 to make me miami farmer hello 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 welcome to the farm welcome to call 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.920
 tv today i present you a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 superb male is reinforced badged razr to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.899
 inside which we are going 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.940
 find a heavy mouse at the bumps the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.860
 latest model that crowns the entire 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 range so the very very high end of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
 razer mouse that offers 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.410
 rather tempting characteristics 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 I'm not sure at all that you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 enjoy this bundle of this puzzle 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.030
 of this packaging forgiveness in the trade 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 namely this briefcase for the simple 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 and good reason we had too 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 in the bundle 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.539
 a small metal usb key of the most 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.329
 beautiful effect jay razer obviously two 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 zigues is not at all certain so in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 any case in the mouse bundle 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 you will have I have a little bit cheated a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 cable since it's a mouse whose 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.939
 cable is detachable since it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 works both wirelessly and with 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.170
 son we have cons of connectors 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.560
 forgiveness usb mini usb gold plated a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 battery 2500 milliamp hours I 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.939
 jumps away at the pedestal base that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.729
 proceeds from gold contactors for the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.400
 reload the pairing button on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.119
 the back we will find the mini 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.369
 usb if you want to play his son 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 a small rubber part for the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.840
 stability on the desk then at 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.850
 mouse level I'm going out the spell 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320
 the removable parts and as you the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.100
 note there are two missing for the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.050
 simple and good reason 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.440
 tea 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.600
 that I have forgiveness already placed on the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.130
 mouse then at the level of the look 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 there is nothing to say the mouse is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.900
 rather nice little criticism to 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.030
 to do against the little criticism to make 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.910
 for the subject matter namely a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 granular plastic matt not the most beautiful 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380
 Indeed not necessarily very rewarding their 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.140
 of soft touch on the competition this 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.960
 being the finish is good very good 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.020
 no criticism at this level the look 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.770
 I tell you I find it quite 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.170
 succeeded then on the back part 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.270
 that of coke a little bit detached that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 wears the head of the three snakes the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.990
 pardon snake with three heads decidedly 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.800
 this part is removable 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.050
 we have and it allows to access the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.140
 hatch for the battery and this part 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.490
 is at the bottom of rise surprises in time and 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.800
 that I 'm recovering that right here 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.810
 be their bronze and long 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.140
 be she is short with a whole 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.180
 possibility between the two a beam 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.740
 central on which you will find 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.430
 a number of graduation that 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.250
 will be illuminated the dpi buttons or 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 in profile which will be re stated here a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.239
 anyway we are on the same 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.510
 system on the center 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.310
 the 2 clicks the wheel as suspended 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.100
 between the two creeks and the one effect 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.590
 really successful aesthetics on the 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.390
 sides a perfect symmetry so that's 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.810
 there that I cheated a little bit to know 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.100
 that I already put a removable part 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.970
 the enal removable parts are maintained 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.890
 by three magnetic pins and it holds 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.810
 very very well so the shortest of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.530
 the smallest parts in his call to 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.600
 a non-slip rubber pad with 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.520
 pimples so a priori a good catch 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 in hand of buttons on your side one 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.470
 find exactly the same thing 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.940
 so for the camera I'm going to change the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.940
 removable parts 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.950
 I will not make you the calculation of the number of 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.850
 opportunities brought by the four 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.650
 removable parts 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.920
 but so we can have a pretty mouse 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.740
 massive or a rather compact mouse 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.870
 under the buttons on the side a little 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.660
 30 translucent band that will illuminate 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.180
 normally in glass if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.099
 below we will find so the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.489
 skates removable parts skates 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:20.160
 of the central body with the two pico's 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.900
 reloading the sensor that make up 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.690
 actually two sensors an optics 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 a laser with two lock buttons 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.700
 whose utility escapes me for the moment 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.040
 on the back a small washer but 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.940
 of metallica him anyway sorry who 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.710
 will allow according to screwing of 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.250
 raise or lower the part 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.990
 back on the front we will find 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.080
 two small lighthouses a small lighthouses 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.060
 1.7 mesh fashionable and we did 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.610
 about the turning point forgiveness I forgot 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.160
 the mini usb located under the wheel very 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.910
 far from wired so this 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.820
 So you feel the sensor is a 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.770
 is an egg 1800 dpi forgiveness we have 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.270
 11 programmable buttons so supported 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.550
 by a pilot 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.140
 razer I have no indication contract 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.850
 the onboard memory chip 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.190
 what I do know is that the 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.060
 swell or pink dresses and sold 149 euros 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.729
 it's expensive 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.229
 however, it still proposes 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.740
 features characteristics 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.880
 rather tempting to see if a game all 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.010
 it can serve 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.039
 so I'll go on my plug 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.720
 machine and I'm going to perform a test 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.320
 playing battlefield 3 I think very 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.000
 good to you right now that 's saying 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.450
 more laure oboro what it takes 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.530
 go play year very soon on 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.570
 cowcotland.com and I invite you if 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.940
 Aliyev to come read the written test well 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.940
 obviously in our company goodbye
