does we just focus on our game we need
we<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.399> play<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:47.670> game

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
we know that if we play our game

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.330 
we know that if we play our game
properly<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.200> need<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> focus<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.980> you

properly we don't need to focus on you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.660 
properly we don't need to focus on you
know<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> stuff<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.340> honestly<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
know that kind of stuff so honestly I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
know that kind of stuff so honestly I
I'm<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.510> happy<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.289> performance<00:00:55.829> because

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I'm not happy of our performance because

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
I'm not happy of our performance because
we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> play<00:00:56.520> ten<00:00:56.670> times<00:00:56.820> better<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we can play ten times better I think we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.479 
we can play ten times better I think we
just<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:58.980> played<00:00:59.160> worse<00:00:59.340> than

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just want because they played worse than

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.860 
just want because they played worse than
us<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.239> played<00:01:00.390> extremely<00:01:00.690> good

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
us not because we played extremely good

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
us not because we played extremely good
so<00:01:01.590> nothing<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> talk<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> about<00:01:03.480> us

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so nothing to talk to it about us

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
so nothing to talk to it about us
absolutely<00:01:04.350> nothing<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.979> 14<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> week<00:01:05.880> we

league standings are they are right now

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
league standings are they are right now
and<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:15.720> something's<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> didn't<00:01:16.439> expect

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and maybe something's you didn't expect

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.429 
and maybe something's you didn't expect
and<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.009> things<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.640> correct

well<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.590> I'll<00:01:19.890> turn<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.220> medium

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
well I think I'll turn it on medium

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.530 
well I think I'll turn it on medium
makings<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> strongest

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
makings are right now the strongest

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230 
makings are right now the strongest
because<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> rained<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> most<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
because it rained the most i think the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.230 
because it rained the most i think the
teams<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.659> supposed<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:26.610> 40<00:01:27.030> top

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
teams that are supposed to be top 40 top

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
teams that are supposed to be top 40 top
five<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> league<00:01:28.610> right<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.710> don't

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
five even in the league right now don't

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
five even in the league right now don't
play<00:01:31.890> good<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.869> opinion

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
play good at all is that in my opinion

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.980 
play good at all is that in my opinion
is<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> truth<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.299> long<00:01:36.450> run<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.869> will

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is the truth so in the long run we will

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690
