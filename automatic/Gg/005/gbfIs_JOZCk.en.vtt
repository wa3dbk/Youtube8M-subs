00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.930
 the Soviet Union collapsed over 20 years 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.990
 backwards 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.390
 changed all people politics appeared 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.430
 imported cars and imported clothing 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.529
 Also, the changes affected the Russian 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.629
 cinema in particular animations 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.269
 earlier Soviet cartoons were taught 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.550
 good conscience and the best quality person 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:43.080
 what we see on the screens today is not 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.080
 almost no criticism 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.260
 we decided to conduct a comparative analysis 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.010
 two 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 first cars in 1992 2 with 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.140
 with the same name of 2009 you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.650
 compare two films we want to understand how 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.629
 has changed 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.629
 cinema over the past 20 years 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.540
 can cartoon have one storyline 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.700
 Pavel and at the same time radically different 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.830
 from each other these differences in our opinion 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.890
 is just a reflection of the spirit of the times 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 and the mores of society 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 The first difference concerns age 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.630
 audience 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.800
 which author addresses the cartoon if in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.690
 one case does not cause anyone 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.610
 doubts that a cartoon for children 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.850
 then the modern cartoon makes about 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.050
 even experts think of it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.369
 after analyzing the cartoon you can do 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.290
 the conclusion is that with all his 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.130
 attractiveness modern cartoon 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.110
 Masha and the Bear 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.119
 addressed to adults and above all 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.190
 parental audience difficulty 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.840
 highlighting the age of the general audience 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.170
 trends in modern cartoons 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.610
 that is, age boundaries are blurred 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.020
 the second difference is due to clarity 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 viewed topics 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.399
 the former cartoon was a film adaptation 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.680
 well-known Russian folk tale 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.530
 you must pay tribute to the author 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.600
 to the team 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.610
 creators very carefully and accurately 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.070
 reacted to the literary material 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.479
 that is, in the first case, this is a cartoon about 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.690
 girl who is careless 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.820
 got them client Medvedev but thanks 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.459
 such traits as diligence and 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.400
 patience diligence and resourcefully able 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.050
 escape the modern cartoon from 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.780
 Russian folk tales left only 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 name hero free interpretation base 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.500
 Literary material can be noted 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.260
 as one of the additional trends 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 modern animation in this way 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.310
 modern cartoon theme highlight 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.110
 not so easy most 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 viewers perceive it as a cartoon 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 o fun witty restless 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.890
 girls and patiently bears however it 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 first external sense with more 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.970
 scrutiny of these meanings 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.580
 you can find much more for example 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.410
 For a psychologist teacher itâ€™s obvious that this 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.269
 cartoon about a hyperactive girl and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.130
 how parents should behave with 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.810
 such children 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.580
 Word as the difference can be noted 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.430
 ambiguity and layering 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.989
 the subject of modern cartoons 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.790
 if the old cartoon masha home 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.860
 the heroine will then behave like 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.980
 positive hero ie work 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.200
 try to tolerate respect 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.269
 in the new cartoon mash despite being 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.250
 that she is the main character and speaking generally 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.049
 childish language good active 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.900
 shows negative patterns 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.140
 behavior capricious perechat steals 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.239
 harm is fighting and so is another trend 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.470
 modern cartoon in the role of the main 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.019
 hero can speak 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.819
 negative character or if the hero 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.830
 formally remains positive 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.860
 then he shows a negative style 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.120
 behaviors that is, we observe 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.730
 the discrepancy between social role and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
 hero behavior 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.450
 analysis of the ideological base shows 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.220
 that to replace the spirit of collectivism and 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.060
 altruism came fetishism and 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.060
 consumer psychology 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.389
 we decided to hold a small 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.430
 sociological experiment and 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.139
 ask around the people of our city about 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.139
 what films do they show their children 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.670
 what kind of cartoons do you give to watch 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.310
 children modern or Soviet because 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.840
 that there the graphics will start because 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.260
 that the plot is enough to understand 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.060
 and understandable language 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.859
 Do I like a child in the winter? 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.710
 these cartoons on your child and court 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.870
 on a little yet not removed 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.050
 seniors have not yet met modern 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.750
 foreign film is much kinder 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:39.150
 power amplifier for children 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.460
 I give all the Soviet modern and for 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.330
 abroad, or that is, whether a child is 6 years old she 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.550
 principle, those three years with 4 she herself 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.530
 selects at all but very fond of mixing 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.130
 here it is us god dependent in this 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.960
 cartoons something is under what well 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.620
 as in advertising, the membrane is very 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.820
 like well wait just now before him 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.990
 reached 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.510
 in a hurry they do not accept such 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.640
 including mache and bear body and type like these 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.460
 boys will affect your child if 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.500
 have any consequences all baby 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.280
 started acting like masha after 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.280
 view 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.370
 In summary, we note that 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.830
 we managed to highlight the following 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.200
 distinctive features of modern 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.660
 children's animation film 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.370
 blurring the age frame liberty 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.200
 interpretations of the original literary 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.950
 of the material 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.050
 ambiguity and layering 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.440
 subject mismatch behavior styles 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.940
 the protagonist of his social role 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.670
 the prevalence of fetishism and consumerism 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.470
 ideologies and now look at any 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.900
 average primary class 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.770
 schools that we will see blurriness 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.620
 age framework 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.960
 before the children behave very infantile 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.730
 rather than age adult thematic 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.500
 fuzziness and liberty of literary 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.240
 interpretations can be traced complex and 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.270
 confusing motivation for action 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.250
 modern children and only consumer 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.240
 psychology and behavioral inconsistencies 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.430
 modern children 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.010
 the role of the student does not require comments 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.290
 all because the cartoon is powerful 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.200
 visual metaphor that governs 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.730
 behavior regardless of our consciousness 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.920
 besides the big screen possesses 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.830
 sanctioning functions ie 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.810
 permission for what is shown there however 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.590
 what is shown creatively witty 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.029
 bright fun is not a children's fairy tale 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.979
 Our creative team believes that 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.779
 domestic animation is in 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.819
 For some reason we believe that to solve 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.159
 this problem needs intervention 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.629
 authorities at the highest angle at 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.089
 President at the state level 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.800
 Duma and at the level of the Federation Council we 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.419
 We hope that they will be able to develop 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.180
 specific development program 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.069
 domestic animation 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.139
 still want to add what should 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.599
 should be allocated a large amount of money 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.370
 shoot kind and intelligent 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.370
 movies cartoons
