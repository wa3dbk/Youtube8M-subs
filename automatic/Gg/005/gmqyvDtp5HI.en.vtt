00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.110 
on board and the best way to defeat them
is<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> take<00:02:26.780> out<00:02:26.930> your<00:02:27.020> smoke<00:02:27.320> bombs<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
is to take out your smoke bombs and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.970 
is to take out your smoke bombs and
incapacitate<00:02:29.120> seven<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.600> them<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.740> way<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
incapacitate seven of them that way you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.240 
incapacitate seven of them that way you
can<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:32.140> kill<00:02:33.140> seven<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.890> them<00:02:34.040> back-to-back

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
can just kill seven of them back-to-back

00:02:34.250 --> 00:03:37.320 
can just kill seven of them back-to-back
without<00:02:35.150> let<00:02:35.330> me<00:02:35.420> try<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.570> kill<00:02:35.810> you

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.790 

so<00:03:38.330> now<00:03:38.540> all<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.930> have<00:03:38.960> to<00:03:39.110> do<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.470> take<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
so now all you have to do is take the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.520 
so now all you have to do is take the
wheel<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.280> then<00:03:41.180> fire<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.720> heavy<00:03:42.020> shot<00:03:42.290> right

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
wheel and then fire a heavy shot right

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.020 
wheel and then fire a heavy shot right
into<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.830> ship<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:45.400> now<00:03:46.400> you'll<00:03:46.580> be<00:03:46.670> able<00:03:46.850> to

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
into the ship and now you'll be able to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.460 
into the ship and now you'll be able to
board<00:03:47.240> it<00:03:47.420> without<00:03:47.660> having<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.110> kill<00:03:48.260> any

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
board it without having to kill any

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.080 
board it without having to kill any
animals<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:52.130> this<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.490> good<00:03:52.670> because<00:03:52.700> you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
animals and this is good because you

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.970 
animals and this is good because you
saved<00:03:53.390> yourself<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.870> lot<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.050> headache<00:03:54.440> trying

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
saved yourself a lot of headache trying

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.250 
saved yourself a lot of headache trying
to<00:03:55.070> defeat<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.400> ship<00:03:55.700> that's<00:03:56.030> probably<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.750> lot

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
to defeat a ship that's probably a lot

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.120 
to defeat a ship that's probably a lot
more<00:03:57.290> upgraded<00:03:57.830> than<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.780> now<00:04:00.770> all<00:04:01.010> you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
more upgraded than you and now all you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.280 
more upgraded than you and now all you
have<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.490> is<00:04:01.790> destroy<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.300> power<00:04:02.510> reserves

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
see on 268 metal you don't get that

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
keep on your wheel because what will end

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.850 
keep on your wheel because what will end
up<00:04:23.210> happening<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.080> these<00:04:24.260> other<00:04:24.530> ships

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
of it so now all you have to do is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.070 
of it so now all you have to do is
that's<00:04:37.820> paddle<00:04:38.210> back<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.510> windmill<00:04:38.900> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's paddle back to the windmill and
