00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.109
 Welcome to the Bastion of Twilight here at the third boss 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.470
 Rather graduates leave 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.829
 in principle, we have a beginning 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:13.689
 Fire and each other as a mob that we have to think at the same time what 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.519
 means here are two dancers before clearly compared to the Boßdorf before 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.130
 Basically it's about checking the mobs down to 25 percent and that 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:27.329
 pretty much at the same time so rather easy 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.049
 In the end, a bit easier Tauber to the side Dacia is still a trifle 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.860
 The lay has the possibility to the Mobs Ball way just below 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.969
 so fold 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.840
 3d this for example and the remaining area on the other 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.340
 Impatient Steinauer 4 has 30 percent among his other and then comes the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.170
 Ball way 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.770
 leave the Low German 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.270
 now better to the capabilities of fire mobility just the 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.790
 Nakedness of all 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.250
 in it a shield is on itself dealing damage and a fort is acting straight 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 has caused extreme damage 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.210
 then damage must be done as soon as the shield is off you can 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.830
 Interrupt ability 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.760
 there should not necessarily be more than 6 to 8-success Hofstetten if he otherwise 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.790
 Fire damage alone strengthens around 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.700
 for the further he entered 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170
 and heron balls to the front that means just thinking of the group 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 He always jumps here again to lay on players 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.930
 leaves a fire-jumper between them 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.720
 this will be very important for the price afterwards 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 because the morning times 8 an ice landscape on Ulmerin players the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.650
 Well, 80 times it causes damage that means they should if possible 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350
 to be interrupted 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 furthermore, this looks like this 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.490
 as projectiles fly through the world 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.619
 I had just met this synonymous and I have a while recording while 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230
 so drenched to stop 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.020
 There must now be fire so that it settles 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.150
 and give it away 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.039
 You just have to go in for that 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.780
 m and Menzel do not 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.409
 just now he must have acted as a murder concatenation as well as complexities 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.360
 Nils also causes extreme damage to the object and all now 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.509
 Player in the room in an ice block transforms the still of water 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.379
 soaked be affected 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.110
 that is why he is immediately slim in something gets 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.650
 Also, the two mops do not have new abilities in the first phase 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.709
 as I said down to 25% 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.180
 this point is reached now now the next two appear now 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.520
 we have a wind and a 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.390
 He has humor 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.050
 to fight for the same rules apply with 25 percent 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.209
 however, because of a bit of other abilities, I'll have my back 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.850
 would storm and we could have a gravitational field 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.089
 in the top left of the picture 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.130
 these protect you against bosses' abilities 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.590
 Of course we all have the hurricanes of course that leaves you in a certain way 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.520
 hover 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.410
 and protect you from the earthquake and exactly what we have just seen 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 this would cause extreme damage and that's why you should look 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.430
 that at least sees the wind 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.869
 the BAV Timmer has on you 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.979
 the other brands will do it later 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.439
 at lightning thunderstorm 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.219
 You can stop this by using the Gravity Spohn 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.859
 he quarrels 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.859
 for by this grounding he suffers no lightning States 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.459
 In principle there is nothing more to say about having this special skills 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.249
 We have also the ability to hoard away from the places Morten 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.019
 and cap shoots these may need to be interrupted but not 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.039
 absolutely 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.989
 and the erp market is still doing that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.569
 how lived on the Midis and on the catches that is why 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.069
 then you have to watch out because you dodge 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.509
 Erdmann also makes a sign 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.359
 that will cause them more damage, but this will be quite normal 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.939
 Militia folded away that would not have to pay attention in principle 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.649
 the most important is that 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.649
 these plans Barth is always on you 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.419
 Now we have reached the final phase where all four are 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.439
 MMORPGs meet and stay in a big future 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.449
 now it's basically about it 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.290
 only the last way to knock that is a pure Emrich phase there it goes 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.609
 just to negotiate Maxi PS cure everything high 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.419
 which probably only gets damage what I do much 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.499
 now since out relatively if in the first two phases 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:21.739
 has worked 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.030
 If all 25% of the pug will be cohesive to some extent 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.560
 value 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.789
 and anything that exceeds this value is also in the wrong way 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.930
 asserted by this 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.889
 so let endboss quasi laid out here in front that means all the less accurate here 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.889
 This difficult headquarters is working in the final phase 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:42.870
 now, in principle, only dicks would have to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.629
 dodge cool you fly through the area 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.270
 it will afterwards be a charitable Scooby on pick one pulls in the air 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.379
 and unfortunately nothing was wrong because that is also extremely high Rhine 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.890
 native of all things and such 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.699
 a little bit more 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.590
 continue on like this one recently on the floor the already professor athlete 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.960
 as a reason sees the wave was present 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.420
 only that this size will be if the post a sign that means farmer custody 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.520
 to grab 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.590
 Of course, it is also through these chains is constantly quoted Deeken world 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.249
 each fly extremely damage 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.690
 that means distributing as much as possible 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.240
 maximum damage came for Speed ​​sat down to look the same 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.589
 and for Fox the festival hall 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.919
 In principle, there is not more to say that there were more abilities 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.849
 Rural is only a companion 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.389
 and I wish you much fun playing and killing the Council of the 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:34.599
 Assistant princes
