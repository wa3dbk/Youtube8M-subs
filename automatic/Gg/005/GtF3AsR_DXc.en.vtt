everyone<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.770> supposedly<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:21.199> monthly

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
everyone there is supposedly a monthly

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.099 
everyone there is supposedly a monthly
deal<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:23.010> there<00:00:23.400> were<00:00:23.550> tags<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.359> I'm

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
deal as well there were tags but I'm

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
deal as well there were tags but I'm
guessing<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> Muncie<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.609> printing

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
guessing that the Muncie is not printing

so<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> weekly<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.150> printed<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
so with the weekly that is printed it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.250 
so with the weekly that is printed it
would<00:00:30.689> make<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.199> 99<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> culture<00:00:33.750> L<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
would make it to 99 but the culture L is
