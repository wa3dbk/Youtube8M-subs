00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
rotate but you got to pick it up that's

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.459 
rotate but you got to pick it up that's
just<00:00:48.070> going<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.280> make<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:49.840> higher<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
just going to make it go higher in the

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.770

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
air and sleep at the same time I'm going

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.169 
air and sleep at the same time I'm going
to<00:00:52.870> catch<00:00:53.019> it<00:00:53.079> with<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.379> back<00:00:53.590> foot<00:00:53.769> bring<00:00:54.179> it

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
to catch it with the back foot bring it

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.450 
to catch it with the back foot bring it
down<00:00:55.679> obviously<00:00:56.679> your<00:00:56.829> first<00:00:57.039> kick<00:00:57.250> flips

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.729 
down obviously your first kick flips
aren't<00:00:57.640> going<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> be<00:00:57.910> as<00:00:57.940> clean<00:00:58.300> as<00:00:58.739> you

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
aren't going to be as clean as you

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.950 
aren't going to be as clean as you
normally<00:00:59.980> would<00:01:00.250> think<00:01:00.550> but<00:01:01.030> practice<00:01:01.929> makes

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
normally would think but practice makes

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.020

example as you can see my kickflip like
awkward<00:01:14.860> not<00:01:15.490> down<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:17.380> no<00:01:17.590> different

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
awkward not down and it's no different

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560
