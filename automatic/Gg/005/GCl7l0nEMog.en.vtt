josh<00:00:16.500> Clark<00:00:18.500> have<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.800> ever<00:00:20.430> thought<00:00:21.150> that

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
josh Clark have you ever thought that

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
josh Clark have you ever thought that
the<00:00:22.380> atmosphere<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.519> weightless<00:00:24.359> because

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the atmosphere was weightless because

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.240 
the atmosphere was weightless because
it's<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.350> light<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.800> air

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it's as light as air

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's as light as air

researchers<00:01:13.220> calculations<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.369> correct<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
researchers calculations are correct is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.249 
researchers calculations are correct is
about<00:01:15.750> 5<00:01:16.380> point<00:01:16.799> 6<00:01:17.220> times<00:01:18.000> 10<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.570> 18th

about 5 point 6 times 10 to the 18th

power or five thousand six hundred
trillion<00:01:23.100> tons<00:01:24.200> that's<00:01:25.200> how<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
trillion tons that's how much the

trillion tons that's how much the
atmosphere<00:01:25.890> weighs<00:01:28.939> right<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
atmosphere weighs right about now you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
atmosphere weighs right about now you
may<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.259> wondering<00:01:31.920> why<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
may be wondering why all of this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.780 
may be wondering why all of this
atmospheric<00:01:33.900> pressure<00:01:34.229> doesn't<00:01:35.159> crush<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
atmospheric pressure doesn't crush you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.219 
atmospheric pressure doesn't crush you
into<00:01:36.000> nothingness<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.280> standing<00:01:38.579> there

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
into nothingness just for standing there

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.090 
into nothingness just for standing there
the<00:01:40.229> answer<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.600> atmosphere

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
the answer is because the atmosphere

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
the answer is because the atmosphere
pushes<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.340> only<00:01:44.640> downward<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.869> all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pushes not only downward but in all

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.690 
pushes not only downward but in all
directions<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.640> including<00:01:48.110> upward

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
directions around you including upward

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
directions around you including upward
that<00:01:50.700> helps<00:01:51.299> dissipate<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that helps dissipate a lot of the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.130 
that helps dissipate a lot of the
pressure<00:01:53.299> plus<00:01:54.299> there's<00:01:54.780> another<00:01:55.140> factor

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.370 

see<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.470> have<00:01:59.710> gas<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.520> air<00:02:01.300> inside<00:02:02.170> your

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
see you have gas and air inside your

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.860 
see you have gas and air inside your
body<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.100> as<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.060> atmospheric<00:02:04.840> pressure

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
body and as the atmospheric pressure

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.920 
body and as the atmospheric pressure
outside<00:02:05.530> your<00:02:06.010> body<00:02:06.190> pushes<00:02:06.760> inward<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
outside your body pushes inward the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.109 
outside your body pushes inward the
atmospheric<00:02:08.680> pressure<00:02:08.740> inside<00:02:09.670> your<00:02:09.729> body

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
atmospheric pressure inside your body

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.080 
atmospheric pressure inside your body
pushes<00:02:10.630> out<00:02:11.850> they<00:02:12.850> equalize<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.760> keep

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
pushes out they equalize and you keep

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.380 
pushes out they equalize and you keep
from<00:02:16.330> being<00:02:16.570> crushed<00:02:16.930> as<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.610> result<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:22.210> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
from being crushed as a result so the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.260 
from being crushed as a result so the
next<00:02:22.600> time<00:02:22.870> somebody<00:02:23.260> says<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.130> hey<00:02:24.700> did

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
next time somebody says to you hey did

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.820 
next time somebody says to you hey did
you<00:02:25.420> know<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.570> atmosphere<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.290> weightless

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
you know that atmosphere is weightless

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.520 
you know that atmosphere is weightless
you<00:02:27.040> set<00:02:27.580> him<00:02:27.700> straight<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.480> tell<00:02:29.080> him<00:02:29.200> Josh

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
you set him straight and tell him Josh

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.840 
you set him straight and tell him Josh
sent<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.100> thank<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.360> joining<00:02:31.630> me
