00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.970 
seconds and when the counter hits nine
or<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.769> it'll<00:03:47.769> go<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.340> next<00:03:48.549> step<00:03:50.579> and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
or so it'll go on to the next step and

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.949 
or so it'll go on to the next step and
it'll<00:03:53.980> look<00:03:54.100> like<00:03:54.280> it's<00:03:54.780> jailbreaking<00:03:55.780> but

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
it'll look like it's jailbreaking but

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.960 
it'll look like it's jailbreaking but
it'll<00:03:56.260> stop<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> process<00:03:56.950> part<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:57.519> through

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.289 

and<00:04:01.260> when<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.350> says<00:04:02.500> waiting<00:04:02.709> for<00:04:03.040> reboot<00:04:03.299> you
