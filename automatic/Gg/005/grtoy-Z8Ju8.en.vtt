basically a hunting scenario very small
circle<00:04:35.990> right<00:04:36.139> here<00:04:37.030> that's<00:04:38.030> your<00:04:38.300> 10x<00:04:40.210> then

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
circle right here that's your 10x then

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.969 
circle right here that's your 10x then
you<00:04:41.300> have<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.570> next<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.669> ten<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:45.500> then

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
you have the next one is a ten and then

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.850 
you have the next one is a ten and then
there's<00:04:46.280> another<00:04:46.400> one<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:48.110> would<00:04:48.260> be<00:04:48.289> say
