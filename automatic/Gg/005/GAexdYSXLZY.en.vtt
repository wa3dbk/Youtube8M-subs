00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.680
Ever wondered if it's possible to build Iron man's armor?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.440
Ahhh, Iron man's armor, a suit with technology so advanced that it is impossible

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.170
to recreate in real life...right?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.480
Well not exactly, since there are several exoskeletons that allow their users to make

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.720
amazing things,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.260
For Example HAL-5 exoskeleton improves the user's strength and resistance and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.649
it is designed to protect rescuers that are working in dangerous zones.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.539
Or the exoskeleton "ReWalk" which allows people to walk again.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.049
But...the exoskeleton that has the biggest resemblance to Iron man's suit is the TALOS military exoskeleton

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.489
which will allow a soldier to bear super human strength, get updated combat info

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.959
info through its visor Heads Up Display, and will also bring protection from a wide range of projectiles through

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.170
a special liquid that becomes solid upon impact by a bullet.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.670
And surely you are saying "But Iron man doesnÂ´t just walk, run and receives fire...

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.320
He also flies! These exoskeletons can't fly!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.190
That's right, these exoskeletons do not fly but for that you could use

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.470
Yves Rossy suit, he developed a jet pack shaped like a wing with multiple engines

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.570
similar to those used in aircrafts worldwide. This jet pack allows him to fly long distances,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.390
for example Yves Rossy tried to cross from Morocco to Spain in his suit...

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030
and he missed...just by 5 km.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.910
So, if you combine a military exoskeleton with this jet pack shaped like a wing

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.100
you could be Iron man? and fight against aliens and robots?

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.960
Well about that, TALOS exoskeleton is still in development, mainly because it's batteries

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.560
are really heavy, and they lose charge very quickly. And the Yves Rossy suit, only works

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.610
when the flight begins from a certain altitude. In other words, he needs to get on a plane or a helicopter,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.450
and then jump to start it's flight.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.350
So, if you wanted to be Iron man nowadays, you would have to jump from a plane

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.580
to start flying, and carry a lot of batteries to fight.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.280
However, Iron man, solves this battery problem with a miniature nuclear reactor

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
that allows him to provide almost infinite energy to his suit.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.069
Unfortunately nowadays all nuclear reactors are huge and they obviously

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.829
do not provide infinite energy

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.280
Well...in regard to this topic, a good candidate for providing energy to Iron Man's armor

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.249
is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion happens when you take Hidrogen atoms called

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:35.249
Deuterium and Tritium and you expose them to pressures and temperatures as high as the ones

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.379
found in our Sun. This makes these hydrogen atoms to fuse together, resulting in Helium

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.049
and an immense quantity of energy

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.659
However, it is worth pointing out that nuclear fusion,  is not the same as nuclear fission, which is

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.650
the nuclear power used nowadays by almost every nuclear reactor in the world. So in nuclear fusion

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.420
you merge together Hydrogen atoms, and you get Helium and energy

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.760
While on nuclear fission you separate atoms from heavy elements like Uranium or Plutonium,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.939
which are divided in the nuclear reactors to provide energy.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.999
So, nuclear fusion can provide us with a lot of energy environmentally safe

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.469
and by "a lot" I mean that 6 liters from water could provide the same energy

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.510
than a ton of coal. So...enough energy to power our Iron man suit.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.769

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.749
Bad news is that for developing a nuclear fusion reactor you need a lot

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:30.169
of money, so much money that the cost of constructing the first

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.889
fusion reactor is being paid by several countries...and there's also another small detail,

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.489
the reactor is the size of a building.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.400
In other words, the technology for powering the Iron Man's suit does exist,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.359
but currently it is still being developed. So let's check back in 20 years, shall we?

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.260
But well...so far we have a military exoskeleton in development which could be the armor

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.769
, a jet pack that can fly long distances, and a nuclear reactor that can

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.959
provide the necessary power, but it needs to be developed and be miniaturized in an almost magic way. And we are

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.930
still missing JARVIS, the Artificial Intelligence that helps Iron Man.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.510
Well...there is a project that aims to develop the First Intelligent Operating System or FIOS,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.820
and they actually named it "Jarvis". This FIOS, is a personalized operating system

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.200
equipped with artificial intelligence, and it will take into account your habits,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.570
and behaviors, and it will adapt to your life style

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.760
, and it can even develop a personality

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.170
And one of the main characteristics of this real life JARVIS, is that you will be able to interact with "it"

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.340
in a natural way using your voice and body language

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.850
So when you will be able to buy it and add it to you Iron mans suit?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.670
Well, there are bad news in that regard, because the company that is developing it

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.480
hasn't published any updates  of its FIOS since 2014

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.010
So for now we will have to settle with our current personal assistants

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.540
like, Siri, Google Now, or Cortana.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.190
Or if you want to you can buy the home automation products that are available

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.570
online. These are devices that allow you to turn on the lights, play music

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.200
, buy things online, open and close doors remotely using your Smartphone

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.700
or computer. So maybe it won't be called JARVIS, but research is being made

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.570
in that regard.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.280
And even if right now it looks like Iron man is a crazy and impossible idea, remember that

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.970
the phone that you're holding right now in your hand or in your pocket, started as that,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.070
a crazy and impossible idea But with enough research, that idea became the device

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.090
that you're holding right now, and it allows you to do things that were unimaginable a few years back.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.970
Like keeping thousands of songs in your hand, talking to almost anyone in the world,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.900
and above all, get connected to an invisible worldwide web, in which the information

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.090
and knowledge are transferred almost instantaneously. And...if we can make that,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.950
it is very likely that we're going to be able to build an Iron man suit.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.950
So, do you know any other technology that would help to build a real life Iron man?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:18.120
