00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.320
 Yes it's a left batter, right? 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.190
 It's Yamada, so it's on the 5th, so next time it's gotta be damn it's a soul or something 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.560
 Plan 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.560
 If you don't try to put out today, you still want to throw at least 7 times, I guess 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.470
 It is- 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.280

 a 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.470
 Matsuzono I'm getting a little better, so if you do the current situation, the batting line will be connected 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.780
 I think but 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.270
 It is the side 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:01.610
