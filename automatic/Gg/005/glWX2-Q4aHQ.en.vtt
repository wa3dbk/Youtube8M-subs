I<00:00:52.560> know<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.870> aerodynamics<00:00:55.280> now

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I know of to do that is aerodynamics now

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
I know of to do that is aerodynamics now
by<00:00:56.460> considering<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.330> aerodynamic<00:00:57.480> truck

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

by considering a more aerodynamic truck
such<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> kenworth<00:00:59.370> t600<00:01:00.240> you<00:01:00.720> can

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
such as this kenworth t600 you can

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
expect the fuel economy between six and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.590 
expect the fuel economy between six and
seven<00:01:04.049> miles<00:01:04.409> per<00:01:04.710> gallon<00:01:05.120> now<00:01:06.120> you're<00:01:06.300> saying

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
seven miles per gallon now you're saying

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
seven miles per gallon now you're saying
to<00:01:06.660> yourself<00:01:06.780> why<00:01:07.470> would<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> switch

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
