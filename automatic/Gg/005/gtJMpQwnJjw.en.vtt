00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
criminals are going to have to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.550 
criminals are going to have to
effectively<00:02:13.050> get<00:02:13.230> into

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
effectively get into

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
effectively get into
sleek<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.920> bank<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.599> story<00:02:16.050> mode

maybe<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.280> might<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.489> two<00:02:17.940> ways<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.930> them

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
maybe there might be two ways for them

to<00:02:19.110> effectively<00:02:19.770> get<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.980> maybe<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.400> go

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
to effectively get in maybe they can go

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.350 
to effectively get in maybe they can go
stealth<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.090> guns<00:02:21.930> blazing<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.150> all

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
stealth or guns blazing now this is all

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630 
stealth or guns blazing now this is all
speculation<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.290> there<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> cops<00:02:26.370> and

in my opinion and just a lot of cool

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.750 
in my opinion and just a lot of cool
things<00:03:28.230> they<00:03:28.590> could<00:03:28.829> do<00:03:28.980> maybe<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.430> little

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
things they could do maybe like a little

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.490 
things they could do maybe like a little
hacking<00:03:30.000> minigame<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.350> could

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
implement similar to I guess watch dogs

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.150 
implement similar to I guess watch dogs
um<00:03:34.819> maybe<00:03:35.819> red<00:03:36.239> lasers<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:37.170> terms<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.920> like

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
um maybe red lasers in terms of like

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.599 
um maybe red lasers in terms of like
trip<00:03:38.760> wires<00:03:39.000> things<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.380> stuff<00:03:40.739> would<00:03:41.489> be

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
trip wires things of that stuff would be

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.330 
trip wires things of that stuff would be
very<00:03:41.910> very<00:03:42.269> cool<00:03:42.540> each<00:03:42.810> different<00:03:43.470> hi<00:03:44.010> Seth

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
maybe one bank has a vulnerability on

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.660 
maybe one bank has a vulnerability on
the<00:03:58.170> side<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.709> voltage<00:03:59.190> stuff<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.639> that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
the side of the voltage stuff like that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.819 
the side of the voltage stuff like that
would<00:04:00.239> be<00:04:00.389> very<00:04:00.630> very<00:04:00.810> cool<00:04:01.170> especially<00:04:01.500> if

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
would be very very cool especially if

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.069 
would be very very cool especially if
they<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.069> incorporate<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.790> effectively<00:04:03.420> with

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
they can incorporate it effectively with

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.629 
they can incorporate it effectively with
cops<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.650> crooks<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.160> guys<00:04:05.430> have<00:04:05.609> been

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
for a while so I think I pretty much

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.150 
for a while so I think I pretty much
laid<00:04:11.280> out<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.670> huge<00:04:12.239> grand<00:04:12.660> plan<00:04:13.019> for<00:04:13.650> rocks<00:04:13.950> are

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
laid out a huge grand plan for rocks are

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.490 
laid out a huge grand plan for rocks are
if<00:04:14.370> they<00:04:14.609> want<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.000> use<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.450> by<00:04:15.989> all<00:04:16.260> means

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
if they want to use this by all means

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.520 
if they want to use this by all means
take<00:04:17.340> whatever<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.209> said<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.810> make<00:04:19.380> it

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
cops and crooks I always think of a game

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430 
cops and crooks I always think of a game
by<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.610> name<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.820> APB<00:04:33.360> not<00:04:33.990> sure<00:04:34.170> if<00:04:34.260> any<00:04:34.380> of

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
by the name of APB not sure if any of

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.020 
by the name of APB not sure if any of
you<00:04:34.530> guys<00:04:34.620> are<00:04:34.800> plated<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:35.520> basically<00:04:35.910> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
you guys are plated but it's basically a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.880 
you guys are plated but it's basically a
cops<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.750> crooks<00:04:36.930> but<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:37.620> what<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
cops and crooks but that's what the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.860 
cops and crooks but that's what the
whole<00:04:38.100> game<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.700> about<00:04:38.850> basically<00:04:39.330> there's<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
whole game is about basically there's a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870 
whole game is about basically there's a
cop's<00:04:40.260> faction<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:40.980> there's<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.550> crooks

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
cop's faction and there's a crooks

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.780 
cop's faction and there's a crooks
faction<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.570> can't<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.500> both<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.580> had<00:04:44.670> to

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
faction and you can't be both you had to

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.360 
faction and you can't be both you had to
pick<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:46.160> basically<00:04:47.160> if<00:04:47.220> you're<00:04:47.340> a

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
pick one so basically if you're a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.740 
pick one so basically if you're a
criminal<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.880> do<00:04:47.970> criminal<00:04:48.420> things<00:04:48.600> if

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
criminal you do criminal things if

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.590 
criminal you do criminal things if
you're<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> cop<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.470> cop<00:04:49.770> things<00:04:50.070> and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
you're a cop you do cop things and

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.910 
you're a cop you do cop things and
basically<00:04:51.600> cops<00:04:51.960> are<00:04:52.140> rewarded<00:04:52.620> when<00:04:52.740> they're

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
basically cops are rewarded when they're

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.620 
basically cops are rewarded when they're
do<00:04:53.100> good<00:04:53.340> things<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.760> criminals<00:04:54.240> are

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
do good things and criminals are

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.050 
do good things and criminals are

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
rewarded when they do criminal things

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.810 
rewarded when they do criminal things
and<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:58.140> don't<00:04:58.740> know<00:04:58.800> maybe<00:04:59.040> cops<00:04:59.430> could<00:04:59.670> do

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
and I don't know maybe cops could do

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.870 
and I don't know maybe cops could do
like<00:05:00.030> Oh<00:05:00.270> recover<00:05:01.260> stolen<00:05:01.620> vehicles<00:05:02.340> arrest

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
something things of that nature or maybe

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.590 
something things of that nature or maybe
like<00:05:09.600> arrest<00:05:09.960> people<00:05:10.290> that<00:05:10.440> have<00:05:10.890> bounties

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
and then of course the crooks could just
