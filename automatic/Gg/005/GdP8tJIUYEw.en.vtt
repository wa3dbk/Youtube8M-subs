00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 what question do i get most often asked by max which is better steelseries siberia v2 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.379
 or razer kraken pro I hear this question so often that I decided to do it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.949
 A comparative review of these two headphones and put an end to this forever 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 question and so we have a battle of gaming headsets steelseries siberia v2 against 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.400
 Fraser kraken pro let's start with the design of the mustache and take and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 a huge number of colors while kraken has only 2 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 from another country, the headband I like more from kraken these others 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 Steelseries doesn’t look as cool as the classic kraken sky 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.350
 the construction problem is that kraken has huge bowls and you look like them 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.590
 Cheburashka but steelseries in this regard is very 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.539
 Looks cool Yes you can say that this is a computer headphone and to whom what 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.329
 the thing is how it all looks on you but people crowd in these headphones and they have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.899
 there are either adapters for mobile devices and either special versions of these 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.600
 headphones for them so anyway 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 This item is important and therefore design is won by Cyberia. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.610
 10 Next convenience item How long can you sit in these headphones? 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.770
 I planted them for 2-3 hours and my ears start to hurt. Even the paint on the navi logos 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.360
 faded and in krakenov I can sit for more than three hours without sad 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 consequences for your ears even if you consider that kraken is the hardest 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.479
 Equal for my head it is more convenient for kraken but I repeat only for my head, however 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.150
 less so far the score is equal to 1 one important item sound control 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.020
 here, of course, without a struggle, Beria is conquered, because Kraken has no 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.100
 volume control and microphone mute button while Cyberia has 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.180
 at home kissing smoke however, the kraken does not give up and immediately compares the score because 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.380
 that unlike c measure and they can be connected to the phone and used as 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.220
 headset microphone will work when you call 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.150
 and to work with a computer there is an adapter if you want 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.319
 connect the target to beria smartphone and use it as a headset 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.599
 then you will need to buy a special adapter 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.340
 however, it is not known how it will work but of course steelseries has 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
 special versions of these headphones for mobile devices but work not only 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.440
 with devices from apple the next moment of noise cancellation is here 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.879
 so kraken pulls ahead of their noise reduction is much better than that 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.069
 Siberia and much more real much so the score is two three now let's talk 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.579
 about durability how long do these headphones serve 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.049
 I can’t tell you this 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.579
 This or that headset constantly complains that either the Kraken or Saiberia breaks 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.700
 then your ear does not work then you have a microphone understood from the wire interrupted 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.060
 here is my cyberia and already more than a year and no complaints anything at all everything 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.810
 excellent here kraken my friend they only half a year because such 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.540
 the colors did not appear immediately and so that you think of a single complaint everything is fine 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.690
 everything is fine just need to use normally the only thing that over time 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.069
 earpieces are deformed ear cushions and they are not so tight to the ears this 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.430
 It concerns both kakken and so, but there's nothing to be done about it this time and 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.790
 you can't argue well and finally let's talk about 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.620
 the sound is the first thing to evaluate the gaming sound if you like meat bass players and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.690
 shots and explosions then your version of kracken if you don't want to hear a lot of bass 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.549
 and you want to hear something besides this, your choice is a saiberia just do not think 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.230
 that in krakenov except bass there is nothing everything is perfectly audible just here is very 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.049
 powerful bass for me personally as a bass fan 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.549
 I like the sound in their kraken because it seems to me juicier but in gather it by 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.720
 my realistic in the game positioning these headphones to each other 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.370
 do not concede, so decide for yourself Kraken bass is a stick about two 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.380
 ends on the one hand it's cool on the other sometimes its too much it and 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.820
 when listening to music plays its role in some genres it is appropriate for 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.400
 Others are better to take here, too, to your taste so you could 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.580
 notice the bill as was 23 and so it was all 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.360
 what if in the first two points it was possible to objectively evaluate the pros and cons 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 then in the last two it all depends on individual preferences 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.819
 Actually, even in this account a lot of my subjective opinion is therefore this 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.870
 the account can be considered also very symbolic however I hope that this 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.880
 The video will help you understand the key features of these two headsets and 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.419
 decide well, but that's all with you was his online photo store and my name is
