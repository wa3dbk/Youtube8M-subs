00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 We 're here at the giroud booth that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.450
 is a French company responsible for 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.140
 this camera that is also called gionotti 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.680
 which is a very small portable camera 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 capable of capturing 360-degree images 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 so she has three lenses works with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.439
 three lenses that capture the image are they 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.219
 capture images simultaneously on 360 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.739
 degrees 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 this image is mounted here in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.230
 then you can transfer the image from the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 your computer for iphone or ipad 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 as it is compatible with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.469
 only apple software because of the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 she be portable 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.550
 we can see some accessories her 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 can be easily adjusted for example 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.469
 the helmet of a cyclist or even in the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 handlebars on a bicycle so that the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.390
 motion capture is fine 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 and the background there on TV 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 confers the final result of the images 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.450
 captured with this camera is like none 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 nor read would be able to reproduce 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.610
 images in 360-degree format 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 the company itself provides a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.680
 player for this purpose 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.770
 so you can access both the images 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.229
 web is you share your images 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.840
 on the site and access to people on the player or 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.690
 through the application for me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.120
 esso on the case for iphone and ipad 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.130
 and on the ipad we still have a 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.240
 differential here you can use 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.850
 the gyro of the device to follow the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.710
 camera movement then ends 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 creating a final result well 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.720
 differentiated very nice 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.670
