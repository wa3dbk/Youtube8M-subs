I believe personally that radishes

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.880 
I believe personally that radishes
coconuts<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.270> fruits<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.380> vegetables<00:04:58.830> that

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
have a white internal core help to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.190 
have a white internal core help to
whiten<00:05:02.160> your<00:05:02.250> eyes<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.910> keep<00:05:03.600> those<00:05:03.810> healthy

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
that are white colored make up

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.310 
that are white colored make up
components<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:15.210> your<00:05:15.300> body<00:05:15.540> of<00:05:15.660> your<00:05:15.870> teeth<00:05:16.080> of
