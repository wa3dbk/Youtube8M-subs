00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello we are here with another video of 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.200
 biology this time with the cells 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.829
 prokaryotes of more specifically with 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.660
 its structure then we start saying 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.170
 that you own cells are cells 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.509
 small ones of the moneros and not 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.750
 they have a defined core because they lack 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.680
 of a nuclear envelope and its DNA 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.040
 circular 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.320
 and do not perform mitosis and have a 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.920
 ribosomes small that for example the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.920
 bacterial cells 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.180
 they are much smaller than the cells 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.650
 eukaryotes that is already one more step of the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 evolution its function that of the ribosomes 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.190
 is the synthesis of proteins from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.570
 an air in the messenger 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 DNA is a molecule gray circular gray 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.600
 located in the nucleus 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.130
 and they have a cell wall and they usually 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.420
 be surrounded also by a capacity 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:13.320
 has multiple microscopic flagella 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 that propel it through the medium 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.720
 It also has some months or more that 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.690
 they are small membrane reflections 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.480
 and also their respiratory enzymes are 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.390
 they find in the plasma membrane and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.820
 photosynthetic prokaryotes the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 enzymes that produce the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.250
 photosynthesis also have to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.430
 locate in the plasma membrane 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.440
 because this type of cells are not very 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.720
 excited for what they do not present 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.010
 so many organelles where you store everything 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.010
 as in eukaryotic cells 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.009
 lacks cytoskeleton and many 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.009
 organelles that will then appear 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.380
 and that's it 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.569
 They are quite simple but good from the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.979
 beginning of life than in other videos 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.979
 we will continue with the eukaryotic cells 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.120
 goodbye
