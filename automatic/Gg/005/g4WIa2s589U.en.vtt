00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of training might want to see both sides

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.200 
of training might want to see both sides
of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> picture<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:32.700> Greg<00:00:33.000> Reis

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
recently put out a book on the topic of
using<00:00:37.260> Bulgarian<00:00:37.920> training<00:00:38.309> for

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
using Bulgarian training for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
powerlifting and other type sports while

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
powerlifting and other type sports while
didn't<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> Lyle<00:00:41.460> attacked<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.059> he

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
didn't like it Lyle attacked it he

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.580 
didn't like it Lyle attacked it he
raised<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> bunch<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> points<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> Greg

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
raised a bunch of points and Greg

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.340 
raised a bunch of points and Greg
created<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.219> counter<00:00:44.550> argument<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
created a good counter argument and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.479 
created a good counter argument and
essentially<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.739> boils<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
essentially what this boils down to is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
essentially what this boils down to is
understanding<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:49.079> everyone

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
understanding that what everyone

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
understanding that what everyone
understands<00:00:50.219> who<00:00:50.309> uses<00:00:50.520> Bulgarian<00:00:51.149> light<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
understands who uses Bulgarian light is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
understands who uses Bulgarian light is
that<00:00:51.690> yes<00:00:51.930> true<00:00:52.710> Bulgarian<00:00:53.280> training<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that yes true Bulgarian training as it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
that yes true Bulgarian training as it
was<00:00:54.180> done<00:00:54.449> by<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> Bulgarians<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.100> only

it's been shown to be effective it works

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's been shown to be effective it works
but<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> thing<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.950> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but the thing is is that it has to be

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
but the thing is is that it has to be
custom<00:01:32.520> tailored<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> needs<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.200> the

should probably check out both articles
and<00:02:20.290> see<00:02:21.190> both<00:02:21.370> sides<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> argument

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and see both sides of the argument

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.360 
and see both sides of the argument
