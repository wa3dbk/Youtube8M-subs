00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.430 

my<00:03:27.040> survival<00:03:27.700> reactions<00:03:28.270> kick<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.110> have

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
my survival reactions kick in and I have

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.120 
my survival reactions kick in and I have
a<00:03:29.470> death<00:03:29.770> grip<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.250> bars<00:03:30.460> but<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:32.070> try<00:03:33.070> and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
a death grip on the bars but I try and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.330 
a death grip on the bars but I try and
loosen<00:03:33.370> them<00:03:33.670> up

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.130 

that's<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> one<00:03:37.330> thing<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.629> don't<00:03:37.840> want<00:03:37.959> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
that's the one thing you don't want to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.170 
that's the one thing you don't want to
do<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.160> tighter<00:03:39.459> grip<00:03:39.670> on<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.970> bars

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
do is have a tighter grip on the bars

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.949 
do is have a tighter grip on the bars

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
because it's not going to let the front

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.920 
because it's not going to let the front
wheel<00:03:44.140> go<00:03:44.410> where<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.739> wants<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.930> those
