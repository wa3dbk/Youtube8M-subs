 start engine start 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.879
 if within three seconds the motor is not 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.280
 start make 3 4 minute pause 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.949
 to restore battery power and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.810
 cooling power booster elements 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.879
 after the engine started 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.019
 switch must be in position 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.459
 turned off
