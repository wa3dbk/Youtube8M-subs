instead<00:03:16.510> we're<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.930> kind<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.349> looking<00:03:18.250> at

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
there half the time and I understand

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.009 
there half the time and I understand
that<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:27.250> might<00:03:27.640> be<00:03:27.819> easier<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.150> CGI<00:03:28.599> creature

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
that it might be easier to CGI creature

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.589 
that it might be easier to CGI creature
in<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.560> make<00:03:29.859> shoots<00:03:30.280> go<00:03:30.549> longer<00:03:31.090> by<00:03:31.269> using

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
in and make shoots go longer by using

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.869 
in and make shoots go longer by using
practical<00:03:32.109> effects<00:03:32.530> for<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.859> wolf<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.670> the

giant praying mantis and all that and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.640 
giant praying mantis and all that and
I'm<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.400> saying<00:03:36.579> CGI<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.329> bad<00:03:37.510> thing<00:03:37.750> using

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650

a<00:04:43.659> lot<00:04:43.780> better<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:45.430> might<00:04:45.580> have<00:04:45.669> been<00:04:45.760> more

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
kids that didn't because kids these days

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.580 
kids that didn't because kids these days
might<00:05:12.940> still<00:05:13.240> reduce<00:05:13.570> bumps

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
might still reduce bumps

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.530 
might still reduce bumps
but<00:05:15.130> it's<00:05:15.280> certainly<00:05:15.580> not<00:05:15.670> as<00:05:15.880> popular<00:05:16.300> as<00:05:16.420> it

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
but it's certainly not as popular as it

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.140 
but it's certainly not as popular as it
was<00:05:16.630> back<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.110> 90s<00:05:17.820> so<00:05:18.820> they<00:05:19.000> need<00:05:19.120> to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
was back in the 90s so they need to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.290 
was back in the 90s so they need to
market<00:05:19.540> this<00:05:19.630> movie<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:20.050> both<00:05:20.230> audiences<00:05:20.500> and

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
market this movie to both audiences and

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.670 
market this movie to both audiences and
I<00:05:22.300> hope<00:05:22.480> that<00:05:22.660> they<00:05:22.810> know<00:05:22.960> that<00:05:23.170> when<00:05:23.590> the

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
I hope that they know that when the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.190 
I hope that they know that when the
second<00:05:23.980> trailer<00:05:24.310> comes<00:05:24.520> out<00:05:24.700> around<00:05:25.240> probably

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
second trailer comes out around probably

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.160 
second trailer comes out around probably
September<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:28.120> anyway<00:05:28.480> is<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:29.050> I'm

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
September but anyway is this that I'm

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.210 
September but anyway is this that I'm
still<00:05:29.410> holding<00:05:29.680> out<00:05:29.740> hope<00:05:29.860> that<00:05:29.920> it's<00:05:30.130> going

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
still holding out hope that it's going

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.180 
still holding out hope that it's going
to<00:05:30.280> be<00:05:30.400> good<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:30.880> right<00:05:31.180> now<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.690> am<00:05:32.190> my

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
to be good but right now I am my

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.180 
to be good but right now I am my
expectations<00:05:33.850> are<00:05:33.970> very<00:05:34.090> low<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:35.830> does<00:05:36.040> not

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
expectations are very low it does not

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.750 
expectations are very low it does not
look<00:05:36.340> as<00:05:36.490> good<00:05:36.610> as<00:05:36.730> I<00:05:36.790> thought<00:05:38.550> but<00:05:39.550> I<00:05:39.580> guess

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
look as good as I thought but I guess

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.810 
look as good as I thought but I guess
we'll<00:05:39.940> find<00:05:39.970> out<00:05:40.300> what<00:05:40.480> happens
