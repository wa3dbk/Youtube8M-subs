00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.890
 frank by android max.de with one 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.129
 Comparison between the two 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.460
 we have available htc models 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:24.380
 on the one hand, the old htc one on the right 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.779
 m7 from 2013 and on the left side the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.199
 htc is doing just that from 2014 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.410
 was presented 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.660
 we come only once on basic 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 specifications so the old htc one 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.399
 has a qualcomm snapdragon 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 600 processor with 1 7 ghz quad-core the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.949
 new htc one has one 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.010
 snapdragon 800 1 3 gigahertz of course 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.449
 Also quad core there is already neat 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.879
 and behind it I say so here is 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.949
 significantly more power in it 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.010
 in everyday life you have to say though 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.899
 both devices are running smoothly 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.220
 So there's not that way right now 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.550
 the big differences 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.340
 Both devices have two gigabyte ram the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.050
 old htc when has 32 gb internal 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 memory the new has only in 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.820
 quotation marks 16 gigabytes internal 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.550
 memory can also be via micro 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.850
 sd cards are being expanded in contrast 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.900
 to the old model so that's the first 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 the basic data so 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.360
 battery capacity the old device has 2300 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.630
 milli-hour has the new device 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 2600 milliamp hours and of course 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.080
 the one of the most important special 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.740
 Of course, that too is specification 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 display 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.560
 you see her right at the old htc when 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.830
 a 4.7 inch super lcd 3 display that is 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.220
 practically an ips display when new is 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.140
 it is also a slcd 3 but with 5 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.190
 inch as I said both in full hd 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.720
 resolution 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 even if the new device, the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.650
 pixel density is a bit lower 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.030
 you can here with both devices 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.590
 No pixels at all explain both 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.080
 are just hot so there is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.820
 absolutely nothing to complain about 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.010
 both devices have one 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.750
 excellent display with too much 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.399
 good 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.080
 lateral view we can 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.010
 once again show a bit of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 above and below so there can be too 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.430
 this year sitting neighbor the subway beautiful 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.100
 read along your emails 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.230
 so these are the basic ones 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 technical specification come to 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 processing the old htc one has here 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.830
 this sound speaker is available 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.690
 about an aluminum housing that is 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.670
 but here in part so 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.060
 glued together with parts of plastic 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.200
 looks very very valuable and very pretty 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.050
 but that's not a classic 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.250
 june was the construction like that 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.739
 new htc at m8 thus owns here is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.110
 really, almost everything has one 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.840
 Metal banner or change if you like that 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.130
 wants and that is also the variant 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.640
 gunmetal, that's the way it is 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.410
 over such a brushed aluminum on 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.890
 The back side looks really good 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.650
 out 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.360
 both devices look really good 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.340
 you also say and feel 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.680
 Fantastic on in the hand so so 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.790
 one has to say haptic are both 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.450
 equipment very very good 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.250
 However, the new HTC makes a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.100
 a bit bigger that means you can 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.830
 significantly less points on the display 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.260
 reach with one finger than when 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.390
 old device since you could almost if you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.370
 big men's hand almost has that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.290
 tapping entire display 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.480
 I think we all got in the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.730
 at the last past twelve months 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780
 The new standard gets used to the 5 inch 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.420
 the upper class are 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.690
 that means you sometimes have to go to the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.910
 Sour apple bite and sometimes bite 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.680
 operating a smartphone with two fingers 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.230
 Let's get to the camera for a short time 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.130
 old had htc train has a 4 megapixel 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.709
 4 megapixel ultra pixel camera with one 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.200
 optical image stabilizer the new htc 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.329
 one also has an ultra pixel 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.400
 Camera also with 4 megapixels 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.200
 but still a second camera 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.050
 especially for the measurement of 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.730
 3d depth information is in charge 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.850
 This can be a lot more interesting 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.799
 Software effects make an example 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.270
 also different in retrospect 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.790
 focus areas in the image or 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.750
 with only certain levels in the picture with 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.880
 provided with effects 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.240
 here is with yul led in there too 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.860
 new device the one year 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.570
 more balanced warm cold picture at 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.050
 generate poor lighting conditions 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.570
 Both devices can work well in the dark 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.700
 good pictures make the ultra pixel 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.550
 camera is characterized by the fact that 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.740
 Above all, she holds good loleit pictures 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.020
 makes front camera are at both 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.490
 devices that are relatively wide-angle I 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.050
 that means you can really good 11 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.800
 is also with larger groups of people 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.090
 for example, school classes or 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.680
 Academy Award participant and the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.650
 ultras the nonsense the front camera in 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.380
 new htc has even 5 megapixel the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.450
 resolution in the old I know now too 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.400
 do not get out of your head but after that 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.260
 are so essentially the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.940
 main differences software runs 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.830
 on both now also on 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.000
 the old android 442, however, still 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.669
 with the sense version 5.5 here the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.060
 points the sense version 6 in the new htc 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.470
 has a few new features 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.950
 Overall, a bit more 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.690
 minimalist and reduced but 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.520
 are mostly yes so changes in detail 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.919
 I want to say oh so important 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.650
 Change, of course, in comparison to 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.750
 from old to new is that old one 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.820
 get over capacitive buttons down here 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.850
 Here is the home button is the one 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.729
 Back button and the new the new device 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.229
 actually about yes after a google 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.330
 You can tell by default 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.099
 Software keys has the space here 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.660
 below that was actually necessary too 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.830
 because there's a lot of technology behind it 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.900
 and so are in the big and 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.539
 all the differences between the two 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.740
 equipment and I believe this up here 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:11.180
 I have not shown that yet 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400
 now a little plastic in the new 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.650
 device in the old device was that too 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.979
 But plastic is a bit different 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.380
 here in the old htc when was the 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.280
 Headphone jack in the top of the new device 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.310
 below and 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.860
 yes, that's actually the new one 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.510
 htc one definitely an exciting one 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.389
 I'm really looking forward to the test 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.850
 the old device is still on 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.500
 that is, if you are the old one 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.450
 You could also be happy 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.340
 and of course that, too 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.230
 consider new ones 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.150
 I hope you have a little bit 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.210
 maybe even helped in the 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.160
 purchase decision if you have the video 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.620
 informative interesting or I like it 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.669
 please just licon and subscribe 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.570
 see us in the next video I am 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.570
 frank from android next
