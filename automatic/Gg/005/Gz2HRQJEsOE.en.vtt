called the oz cocktail or the hipbone

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.269 
called the oz cocktail or the hipbone
one<00:00:04.200> side<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.589> pelvis<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.100> that's

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
one side of the pelvis and that's

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.860 
one side of the pelvis and that's
actually<00:00:05.460> made<00:00:05.819> up<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.120> freehold<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:10.370> ilium

actually made up in the freehold I ilium
ischium<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:15.320> as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.560> add<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
ischium and as you add to that the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:39.700 
ischium and as you add to that the
sacrum<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> Cox

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.590 

portales<00:00:40.710> means<00:00:40.920> basis<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.150> it's<00:00:42.330> a<00:00:42.420> big

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
portales means basis see like it's a big

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.979 
portales means basis see like it's a big
face<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.330> have<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> us

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
face and then you have the to us

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.160 
face and then you have the to us
cocktail<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> taken<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> convicts

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
cocktail it is taken to the convicts

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
cocktail it is taken to the convicts
what<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> does<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.860> attaches<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.550> lower

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
what that does is it attaches the lower

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
what that does is it attaches the lower
limb<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> actual<00:00:51.900> cell<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.980> that's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
limb to the actual cell and then that's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
limb to the actual cell and then that's
going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> transmit<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> way<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.720> body<00:00:58.110> into

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
going to transmit the way our body into

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.759 
going to transmit the way our body into
the<00:00:58.620> lower<00:00:58.860> middle<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.410> there's

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
the lower middle and then also there's

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.200 
the lower middle and then also there's
some<00:01:01.890> organs<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.400> pelvis<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.089> are

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
some organs of the pelvis that are

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
some organs of the pelvis that are
supported<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:08.399> now<00:01:08.550> talk<00:01:08.820> about<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> Ilia

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
supported by so now talk about the Ilia

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.170 
supported by so now talk about the Ilia
not<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.649> stop<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.190> here<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> large

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
not going to stop are here it's a large

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.859 
not going to stop are here it's a large
glaring<00:01:15.780> bone<00:01:16.700> at<00:01:17.700> crest<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> free<00:01:18.720> hand

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
glaring bone at crest like a free hand

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
glaring bone at crest like a free hand
on<00:01:19.050> your<00:01:19.170> hips<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> people<00:01:19.890> say<00:01:20.039> even<00:01:20.729> though

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
on your hips that people say even though

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.389 
on your hips that people say even though
you<00:01:20.910> hip<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.660> really<00:01:21.899> down<00:01:22.050> here<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.100> right

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
you hip is really down here but right

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:36.420 
you hip is really down here but right
there<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.210> ask

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.090 

so<00:01:37.430> part<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.479> ilium<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.170> articulates<00:01:39.619> with

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
so part of the ilium it articulates with

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340 
so part of the ilium it articulates with
the<00:01:40.460> sacrum<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.210> going<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.539> be<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.840> articular

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the sacrum is going to be this articular

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.200 
the sacrum is going to be this articular
surfaces<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:44.750> be<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:45.049> here<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
surfaces to be right here so the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.240 
surfaces to be right here so the
articular<00:01:50.210> surface<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.560> counter<00:01:52.070> that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
articular surface of it is counter that

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.029 
articular surface of it is counter that
L<00:01:52.460> shape<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.319> this<00:01:57.560> surface

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
L shape and then you have this surface

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:09.600 
L shape and then you have this surface
where<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.310> gluteal<00:01:58.850> muscles<00:01:59.240> attached<00:01:59.569> I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.339 

said<00:02:10.610> there's<00:02:10.880> four<00:02:11.269> different<00:02:11.299> spines<00:02:11.989> for

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
said there's four different spines for

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.729 
said there's four different spines for
the<00:02:12.440> ilium<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:14.200> basically<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.440> two<00:02:15.590> on

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the ilium and basically you have two on

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.390 
the ilium and basically you have two on
the<00:02:15.860> front<00:02:16.010> two<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.769> you<00:02:18.769> have<00:02:18.920> an

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the front two in the back you have an

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.030 
the front two in the back you have an
interior<00:02:20.030> superior<00:02:20.750> iliac<00:02:21.230> spine<00:02:21.290> which<00:02:21.890> is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
interior superior iliac spine which is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.770 
interior superior iliac spine which is
the<00:02:22.130> ASIS<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:28.030> then<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.269> an<00:02:29.390> interview

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the ASIS and then you have an interview

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.830 
the ASIS and then you have an interview
one<00:02:30.079> so<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.739> tie<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.400> guess<00:02:31.670> they<00:02:32.540> have<00:02:32.720> a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
one so it's a tie I guess they have a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.020 
one so it's a tie I guess they have a
sis<00:02:33.260> from<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:33.950> eight<00:02:34.130> highness<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.760> that's

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
sis from the eight highness so that's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.300 
sis from the eight highness so that's
gonna<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:38.959> here<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.799> other<00:02:39.950> ones<00:02:40.160> down<00:02:40.340> below

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
gonna be here the other ones down below

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.379 
gonna be here the other ones down below
and<00:02:43.310> then<00:02:43.549> those<00:02:43.730> are<00:02:43.850> going<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> be<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.150> lot<00:02:44.359> of

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
and then those are going to be a lot of

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.470 
and then those are going to be a lot of
attachments<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:45.109> muscles<00:02:45.470> over<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:49.100> then

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
attachments for muscles over and then

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.449 
attachments for muscles over and then
your<00:02:50.480> side<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.590> can<00:02:51.620> imagine<00:02:51.950> what<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.370> can

and you can have the greater sciatic

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:37.680 
and you can have the greater sciatic
notch<00:03:15.160> here

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:04:17.699

patient is going to be the ASIS and the
PSIs

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.130 

so<00:04:33.270> then<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.630> brings<00:04:33.660> us<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:35.480> issue<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.990> most

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
so then that brings us to issue the most

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.570 
so then that brings us to issue the most
prominent<00:04:40.470> part<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.890> issues<00:04:41.220> going<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.490> be

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
prominent part of issues going to be

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.130 
prominent part of issues going to be
racial<00:04:41.910> tuberosity<00:04:42.510> that's<00:04:42.690> basically<00:04:43.020> the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
racial tuberosity that's basically the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.360 
racial tuberosity that's basically the
bones<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.560> your<00:04:43.710> studio<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.160> going<00:04:47.310> to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
bones of your studio and it's going to

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.040 
bones of your studio and it's going to
be<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.610> posterior<00:04:48.060> inferior<00:04:48.330> part<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
be the posterior inferior part of the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.180 
be the posterior inferior part of the
pelvis<00:04:50.720> all<00:04:51.720> three<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.350> bones<00:04:52.560> meet<00:04:52.920> in

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
pelvis all three of the bones meet in

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.490 
pelvis all three of the bones meet in
the<00:04:53.490> acetabular<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.730> see<00:04:56.940> right<00:04:56.970> here

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
the acetabular you can see right here

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.230 
the acetabular you can see right here
but<00:04:58.500> they<00:04:58.620> all<00:04:58.800> meet<00:04:59.070> here<00:04:59.700> is<00:04:59.820> going<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.030> be<00:05:00.180> an

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
but they all meet here is going to be an

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:11.600 
but they all meet here is going to be an
addition<00:05:00.720> here<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:11.100> then<00:05:11.250> you're<00:05:11.460> going<00:05:11.550> to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
addition here and then you're going to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.530 
addition here and then you're going to
have<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:14.010> additional<00:05:14.430> spine<00:05:14.970> right<00:05:15.210> here<00:05:15.450> it

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
have this additional spine right here it

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.750 
have this additional spine right here it
advised<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.410> pelvis<00:05:16.860> between<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> greater

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
advised the pelvis between the greater

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.940 
advised the pelvis between the greater
sciatic<00:05:18.000> notch<00:05:18.420> on<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.660> left<00:05:18.870> side<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:22.710> then

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
sciatic notch on the left side and then

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.310 
sciatic notch on the left side and then
the<00:05:23.010> greater<00:05:23.670> sciatic<00:05:23.910> notch<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.660> part<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.170> the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
the greater sciatic notch is part of the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620 
the greater sciatic notch is part of the
initiative<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.980> mean<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> helium<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:26.970> then<00:05:27.510> the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
initiative I mean a helium and then the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.530 
initiative I mean a helium and then the
lesser<00:05:28.020> is<00:05:28.080> part<00:05:28.410> of<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.620> visionary<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:32.640> then

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
lesser is part of the visionary and then

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.420 
lesser is part of the visionary and then
this<00:05:34.380> is<00:05:34.560> one<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.860> landmark<00:05:35.280> and

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
this is one of the landmark and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.760 
this is one of the landmark and
innovations<00:05:36.240> ovation<00:05:36.990> philosophy<00:05:37.620> that's

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
innovations ovation philosophy that's

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.980 
innovations ovation philosophy that's
going<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.040> get<00:05:38.220> orange<00:05:38.790> in<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.030> lot

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.450 

so<00:05:46.530> then<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:46.890> leaves<00:05:47.070> us<00:05:47.250> with<00:05:47.430> the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
so then that leaves us with the

00:05:47.460 --> 00:06:04.970 
so then that leaves us with the
beautiful<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:02.840> it's<00:06:03.840> fused<00:06:04.290> with<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.530> ilium

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
beautiful and it's fused with the ilium

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.950 
beautiful and it's fused with the ilium
in<00:06:05.100> initiative<00:06:05.640> and<00:06:05.940> then<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:06.570> pubic<00:06:06.930> bone

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
in initiative and then the pubic bone

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.870 
in initiative and then the pubic bone
actually<00:06:07.350> the<00:06:07.650> two<00:06:07.830> pubic<00:06:08.190> bones<00:06:08.400> articulate

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
actually the two pubic bones articulate

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.820 
actually the two pubic bones articulate
with<00:06:09.150> each<00:06:09.360> other<00:06:09.600> and<00:06:10.080> they<00:06:10.530> have<00:06:10.800> a

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
with each other and they have a

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.400 
with each other and they have a
particular<00:06:11.340> disc<00:06:11.610> right<00:06:11.850> in<00:06:12.000> here<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:13.110> that's

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
particular disc right in here and that's

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.310 
particular disc right in here and that's
the<00:06:13.620> pubic<00:06:13.950> symphysis<00:06:17.810> so<00:06:18.810> that's<00:06:19.050> going<00:06:19.260> to

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
the pubic symphysis so that's going to

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.990 
the pubic symphysis so that's going to
be<00:06:19.440> one<00:06:19.590> of<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.800> landmarks<00:06:20.130> needed<00:06:20.640> up<00:06:20.760> here

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
be one of the landmarks needed up here

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.760 
be one of the landmarks needed up here
is<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.330> two<00:06:21.510> sentences<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:27.510> then<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.740> other

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
is the two sentences and then the other

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.400 
is the two sentences and then the other
thing<00:06:29.040> is<00:06:29.250> we<00:06:29.910> have<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.060> operator<00:06:30.780> frame<00:06:31.170> and

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
thing is we have this operator frame and

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.000 
thing is we have this operator frame and
that's<00:06:31.590> open<00:06:32.160> your<00:06:32.310> ears<00:06:32.610> right<00:06:33.410> that<00:06:34.410> there's

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
that's open your ears right that there's

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.750 
that's open your ears right that there's
a<00:06:35.070> membrane<00:06:35.550> that<00:06:35.580> covers<00:06:36.000> that<00:06:37.580> right<00:06:38.580> in

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
a membrane that covers that right in

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.860 
a membrane that covers that right in
right<00:06:38.910> there<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.300> then<00:06:39.450> there's<00:06:39.660> going<00:06:39.780> to<00:06:39.840> be

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
right there and then there's going to be

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.470 
right there and then there's going to be
muscles<00:06:40.260> that<00:06:40.350> come<00:06:40.560> on<00:06:40.680> either<00:06:40.830> side<00:06:41.160> of<00:06:41.190> it

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
muscles that come on either side of it

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:49.960 
muscles that come on either side of it
I've<00:06:42.480> got<00:06:42.780> operator<00:06:43.320> internist<00:06:43.800> an<00:06:43.920> operator

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.000 

okay<00:06:50.970> so<00:06:51.030> then<00:06:51.330> obviously<00:06:51.570> we<00:06:51.900> know<00:06:52.590> that<00:06:52.830> the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
okay so then obviously we know that the

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.250 
okay so then obviously we know that the
pelvis<00:06:53.550> are<00:06:54.000> different<00:06:54.600> between<00:06:54.660> males<00:06:55.080> and

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
pelvis are different between males and

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.160 
pelvis are different between males and
females<00:06:55.350> on<00:06:56.310> Cena's<00:06:56.880> female<00:06:57.360> Phelps<00:06:57.690> designed
