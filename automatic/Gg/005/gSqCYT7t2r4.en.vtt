00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
there I read him perfectly but he gets

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.240 
there I read him perfectly but he gets
to<00:03:11.030> overthrow<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.810> right<00:03:11.989> side<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.100> he

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
to overthrow to the right side so he

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
to overthrow to the right side so he
goes<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.910> fourth<00:03:14.239> down<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:14.720> he<00:03:14.989> gets

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
goes for it on fourth down and he gets

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.229 
goes for it on fourth down and he gets
it<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:15.709> his<00:03:15.920> first<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.550> only<00:03:16.670> try<00:03:17.030> then

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
it so that's his first and only try then

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.750 
it so that's his first and only try then
he<00:03:17.330> hits<00:03:17.480> me<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.810> ghost<00:03:18.019> route<00:03:18.610> scores<00:03:19.610> his

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
he hits me with a ghost route scores his

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.660 
he hits me with a ghost route scores his
first<00:03:19.940> touchdown<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:22.069> still<00:03:22.280> second

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
first touchdown so it's still second

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.670 
first touchdown so it's still second
