them will be in the game and there's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
them will be in the game and there's
some<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.289> cool<00:00:31.560> stuff<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
some really really cool stuff you do a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
some really really cool stuff you do a
bit<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.640> let's<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.660> also<00:00:33.989> this

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
bit so let's get right into it also this

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
bit so let's get right into it also this
is<00:00:34.230> PC<00:00:34.559> gameplay<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.070> best<00:00:35.309> buy<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.579> every

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
is PC gameplay it's best buy that every

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.830 
is PC gameplay it's best buy that every
time<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.239> basically<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.719> it's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
time but it's basically because it's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.650 
time but it's basically because it's
already<00:00:36.989> MPC<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.399> figure<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.940> way<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> can

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
already MPC and I figure that way I can

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
already MPC and I figure that way I can
you<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.960> show<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.410> rather<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.649> just

somewhat late game for you know soon as
you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:54.870> airport<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
because it can be mined with an iron

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
because it can be mined with an iron
pickaxe<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> OBS<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.739> never<00:00:58.890> and

pickaxe and up OBS he goes for never and
basically<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.149> around<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.800 
built into it or PM ps3 of course but
basically<00:01:11.490> once<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> nether<00:01:12.630> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
basically once you're in the nether you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
basically once you're in the nether you
can<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.700> just<00:01:14.700> find<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> then

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
can then just find these things and then

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
can then just find these things and then
you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.170> mine<00:01:16.350> them<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> once<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> mind

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you can mine them and once if you mind

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
you can mine them and once if you mind
them<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.479> cooler<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:18.990> never<00:01:19.140> course

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
them you get a cooler will never course

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.230 
them you get a cooler will never course
it<00:01:19.470> looks<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.430> also<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.909> tiny

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it looks like this and you also get tiny

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
it looks like this and you also get tiny

actually a really good thing to mind

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually a really good thing to mind
because<00:01:30.350> they<00:01:31.350> were<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.619> XP<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> they're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
because they were right XP and they're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
because they were right XP and they're
the<00:01:32.400> easiest<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.299> find<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.780> opinion

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the easiest all to find in my opinion

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
the easiest all to find in my opinion
because<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> fact<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> nether

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because of the fact that in the nether

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
because of the fact that in the nether
you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> blocks<00:01:36.900> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you can just see all the blocks it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
you can just see all the blocks it's
kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> find<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> massive<00:01:38.400> cave

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
kind of like if you find a massive cave

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
kind of like if you find a massive cave
you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.030> lots<00:01:39.150> pours<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.079> never<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can see lots pours the never the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
you can see lots pours the never the
entire<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.250> essentially<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> massive

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
entire thing is essentially a massive

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
entire thing is essentially a massive
cave<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.680> never

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
cave so you see a lot of the never

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
cave so you see a lot of the never
quartz<00:01:44.189> round<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.000> basically<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
quartz round so basically you can get a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
quartz round so basically you can get a
lot<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.229> stuff<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.740> win<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.100> easy

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
lot this stuff you can win or is easy

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.830 
lot this stuff you can win or is easy
and<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.540> big

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and it's a pretty good way to get big

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
and it's a pretty good way to get big
you<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> XP<00:01:50.610> per<00:01:50.759> block

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you don't get a lot of XP per block

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.270 
you don't get a lot of XP per block
ballina<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.840> adds<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> amount<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
ballina it adds up because the amount of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.649 
ballina it adds up because the amount of
medical<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> patch<00:01:54.360> there

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
medical so you see there's a patch there

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
medical so you see there's a patch there
there's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> patch<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.649> there's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> patch

can do with it so first of all you can
just<00:02:14.860> craft<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.760> into<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.630> nether<00:02:16.959> blocks

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
just craft it into the nether blocks

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.440 
just craft it into the nether blocks
which<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:17.770> down<00:02:18.099> here<00:02:18.340> they<00:02:18.880> look<00:02:19.030> really

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
which are down here they look really

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
which are down here they look really
really<00:02:19.900> similar<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.349> look<00:02:20.620> fine<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.130> you

can't really tell them apart besides the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.920 
can't really tell them apart besides the
sly<00:02:23.950> different<00:02:24.670> textural<00:02:25.000> book<00:02:25.209> mine<00:02:25.420> yeah

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
sly different textural book mine yeah

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.240 
sly different textural book mine yeah
you<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.230> make<00:02:26.319> them<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.530> flocks<00:02:26.739> flying<00:02:27.010> by

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
you can make them in flocks flying by

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.479 
you can make them in flocks flying by
just<00:02:27.459> complaining<00:02:27.940> bore<00:02:28.269> into<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:28.750> which

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
just complaining bore into one which

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.199 
just complaining bore into one which
obvious<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.580> kind<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.819> like<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.060> never

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
obvious it's kind of like the never

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.479 
obvious it's kind of like the never
bricks<00:02:31.420> instead<00:02:31.780> bricks<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.220> once<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.340> have

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
bricks instead bricks and once you have

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.460 
bricks instead bricks and once you have
another<00:02:33.730> block<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.180> court<00:02:34.720> then<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.349> do

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
another block of court then you can do

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.710 
another block of court then you can do
some<00:02:35.680> pretty<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.610> know<00:02:36.790> cool<00:02:37.239> looking<00:02:37.510> things

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
some pretty I know cool looking things

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.930 
some pretty I know cool looking things
my<00:02:37.870> opinion<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:39.069> also<00:02:39.370> there's<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> little

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
my opinion and also there's a little

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.070 
my opinion and also there's a little
daylight<00:02:40.180> sensor<00:02:40.480> here<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:40.989> gonna

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
daylight sensor here so I'm just gonna

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.960 
daylight sensor here so I'm just gonna
mind<00:02:41.440> my<00:02:41.470> way<00:02:41.650> through<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.700> yeah<00:02:42.790> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
mind my way through this but yeah this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.240 
mind my way through this but yeah this
is<00:02:43.150> never<00:02:43.420> quartz<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.350> it's<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.769> really

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
is never quartz right here it's a really

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.750 
is never quartz right here it's a really
really<00:02:45.850> nice<00:02:46.269> looking<00:02:46.750> block<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.760> really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
really nice looking block I really

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.920 
really nice looking block I really
really<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.150> look<00:02:49.330> fit<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> stuff<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
really like look fit the stuff on the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.380 
really like look fit the stuff on the
floor<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.230> stuff<00:02:50.590> by<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.739> way<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:52.030> iron

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
floor is stuff by the way it's like iron

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.150 
floor is stuff by the way it's like iron
but<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.080> little<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.680> cleaner<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.100> it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
but it's a little bit cleaner and it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.770 
but it's a little bit cleaner and it
looks<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.580> good<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.390> my<00:02:55.569> bank

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
looks really good like this my bank

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.330 
looks really good like this my bank
account<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.319> meijer<00:02:56.470> survival<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.130> world

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
account in meijer survival it's my world

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.559 
account in meijer survival it's my world
it<00:02:57.730> would<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.910> been<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.060> know<00:02:58.330> really

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
it would have been you know really

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.750 
it would have been you know really
exciting<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.950> looks<00:03:00.430> really

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
exciting I think and it looks really

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.890 
exciting I think and it looks really
really<00:03:00.970> good<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:01.569> one<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.840> more

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
really good and it's one of the more

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.170 
really good and it's one of the more
exciting<00:03:02.440> additions<00:03:02.799> but<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.340> won<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.000> cool

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
exciting additions but I won the cool

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.550 
exciting additions but I won the cool
things<00:03:04.390> as<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:04.930> turn<00:03:05.049> into<00:03:05.260> pillars

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
things as you can then turn into pillars

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.080 
things as you can then turn into pillars
which<00:03:05.739> look<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.549> make<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.000> know

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
which look like this and make you know

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.240 
which look like this and make you know
some<00:03:07.299> cool<00:03:07.450> Creek<00:03:07.810> looking<00:03:08.140> buildings<00:03:08.500> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
some cool Creek looking buildings and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.890 
some cool Creek looking buildings and
I'll<00:03:09.370> top<00:03:09.549> that<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.730> can<00:03:09.970> make<00:03:10.120> stairs<00:03:10.480> outfit

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
I'll top that you can make stairs outfit

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.780 
I'll top that you can make stairs outfit
you<00:03:11.049> comic<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.530> I'm<00:03:11.799> block<00:03:12.010> stairs<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.610> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
you comic I I'm block stairs so you can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.270 
you comic I I'm block stairs so you can
make<00:03:12.910> white<00:03:13.450> stairs<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.019> are<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.410> clean<00:03:14.709> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
make white stairs that are so clean so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.860 
make white stairs that are so clean so
smooth<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.790> think<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.180> are<00:03:16.239> just<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> best

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
smooth I think these are just the best

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.020 
smooth I think these are just the best
looking<00:03:17.590> blocks<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.549> game<00:03:18.790> perhaps

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
looking blocks in the game perhaps

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.199 
looking blocks in the game perhaps
besides<00:03:19.630> maybe<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.859> know<00:03:20.950> maybe<00:03:21.160> emerald<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
besides maybe you know maybe emerald and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.259 
besides maybe you know maybe emerald and
that's<00:03:22.630> all<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.959> can<00:03:23.019> really<00:03:23.140> say<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:23.650> yes<00:03:23.829> so

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
that's all I can really say but yes so

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.610 
that's all I can really say but yes so
we<00:03:25.269> have<00:03:25.390> both<00:03:25.540> emerald<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.380> coming

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
we have both emerald and this coming

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.590 
we have both emerald and this coming
which<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:26.950> exciting<00:03:27.190> talent<00:03:27.579> 14<00:03:27.880> yes<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.540> you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
which is exciting talent 14 yes so you

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.449 
which is exciting talent 14 yes so you
can<00:03:28.780> also<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.109> can<00:03:29.230> do<00:03:29.319> extra<00:03:29.950> things<00:03:29.980> but<00:03:30.430> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can also you can do extra things but it

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.650 
can also you can do extra things but it
doesn't<00:03:30.730> end<00:03:30.850> there<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.209> not<00:03:31.329> just<00:03:31.510> lame

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
doesn't end there it's not just lame

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.539 
doesn't end there it's not just lame
thing<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.470> two<00:03:32.620> things<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:32.920> might<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.340> coming

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
thing so two things that might be coming

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.400 
thing so two things that might be coming
it's<00:03:33.819> obviously<00:03:34.120> not<00:03:34.209> 100%<00:03:34.900> confirm<00:03:35.200> because

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
it's obviously not 100% confirm because

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.870 
it's obviously not 100% confirm because
there's<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.739> lot<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:35.980> Resident<00:03:36.430> changes<00:03:36.730> that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
there's a lot of Resident changes that

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.490 
there's a lot of Resident changes that
need<00:03:37.000> for<00:03:37.180> both<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.390> these<00:03:37.480> as<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.350> can

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
need for both of these as you can

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.140 
need for both of these as you can
actually<00:03:38.560> use<00:03:38.829> in<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.100> crafting<00:03:39.489> recipes<00:03:39.850> one

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
actually use in to crafting recipes one

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.970 
actually use in to crafting recipes one
to<00:03:40.359> make<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.810> little<00:03:41.139> thing<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.410> comparator

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
to make this little thing a comparator

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.069 
to make this little thing a comparator
and<00:03:42.130> one<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.850> make<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.000> daylight<00:03:43.359> sensor<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
and one to make a daylight sensor so the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.720 
and one to make a daylight sensor so the
daylight<00:03:44.350> sensor<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.069> lot<00:03:45.340> easier<00:03:45.370> to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
daylight sensor is a lot easier to

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.800 
daylight sensor is a lot easier to
explain<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.180> I'll<00:03:46.299> explain<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.630> first

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
explain so I'll explain it first

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.410 
explain so I'll explain it first
basically<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.040> senses<00:03:48.489> daylight<00:03:48.819> if<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.180> has

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
basically it senses daylight if it has

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.629 
basically it senses daylight if it has
daily<00:03:49.630> above<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.079> if<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.739> blocked<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.370> that

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
daily above it if I blocked it like that

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.490 
daily above it if I blocked it like that
for<00:03:51.700> instance<00:03:52.030> then<00:03:52.840> actually<00:03:53.170> wouldn't<00:03:53.380> be

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
for instance then actually wouldn't be

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.979 
for instance then actually wouldn't be
able<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.769> sense<00:03:53.950> daylight<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.549> um<00:03:54.840> I'll<00:03:55.840> show

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
able to sense daylight but um I'll show

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.539 
able to sense daylight but um I'll show
you<00:03:56.079> right<00:03:56.170> now<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.410> does<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.709> at<00:03:56.829> nighttime<00:03:57.190> it

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
you right now it does so at nighttime it

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.099 
you right now it does so at nighttime it
doesn't<00:03:58.000> send<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.180> redstone<00:03:58.420> signal<00:03:58.690> for<00:03:58.989> all

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
doesn't send a redstone signal for all

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.530 
doesn't send a redstone signal for all
of<00:03:59.230> its<00:03:59.410> outputs<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.430> when<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.790> daytime<00:04:01.299> it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
of its outputs and when it is daytime it

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.569 
of its outputs and when it is daytime it
does<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:02.380> pretty<00:04:02.590> much<00:04:02.709> just<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:03.040> way<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> lock

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
does it's pretty much just a way to lock

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.220 
does it's pretty much just a way to lock
your<00:04:03.790> doors<00:04:04.030> at<00:04:04.180> night<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.079> can

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
your doors at night like so like I can

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.390 
your doors at night like so like I can
actually<00:04:05.260> get<00:04:05.590> four<00:04:05.769> hooks<00:04:05.950> it's<00:04:06.160> nighttime

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
actually get four hooks it's nighttime

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400 
actually get four hooks it's nighttime
they're<00:04:06.670> built<00:04:06.850> today<00:04:07.030> but<00:04:07.900> if<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.019> turn<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.350> to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
they're built today but if I turn it to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.900 
they're built today but if I turn it to

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
is what the koala does you add three

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.849 
is what the koala does you add three
thousands<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.450> time<00:04:13.690> i<00:04:13.930> guess<00:04:14.440> i<00:04:14.560> need<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.739> add

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
thousands the time i guess i need to add

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.759 
thousands the time i guess i need to add
more<00:04:15.010> than<00:04:15.130> 3000<00:04:15.639> ad<00:04:16.389> let's<00:04:17.139> say<00:04:17.320> seven

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
more than 3000 ad let's say seven

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.180 
more than 3000 ad let's say seven
thousand<00:04:18.930> she<00:04:19.930> had<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.169> time<00:04:20.380> now<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
thousand she had a time now and as you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.460 
thousand she had a time now and as you
can<00:04:21.340> see<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:22.300> now<00:04:22.599> outputs<00:04:23.020> redstone<00:04:23.440> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
can see it's a now outputs redstone and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.690 
can see it's a now outputs redstone and
the<00:04:23.680> door<00:04:23.830> open<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:24.370> its<00:04:24.490> base

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
the door open so its base

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700 
the door open so its base

redstone power gets implemented in which

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.140 
redstone power gets implemented in which
I'll<00:04:38.290> explain<00:04:38.410> here<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.820> restaurant

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
I'll explain here so the restaurant

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.180 
I'll explain here so the restaurant

in<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.760> update<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.390> could<00:04:43.630> be<00:04:43.780> again<00:04:44.200> this<00:04:44.470> is

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
in this update it could be again this is

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.920 
in this update it could be again this is
a<00:04:44.680> complete<00:04:45.160> guess<00:04:45.400> no<00:04:46.180> real<00:04:46.360> back<00:04:46.570> pine<00:04:46.780> this

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
a complete guess no real back pine this

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.690 
a complete guess no real back pine this
one<00:04:47.140> but<00:04:47.410> basically<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:48.430> redstone

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
one but basically the redstone

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.030 
one but basically the redstone
comparator<00:04:48.760> could<00:04:49.480> be<00:04:49.660> coming<00:04:50.020> because<00:04:50.230> i

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
comparator could be coming because i

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.190 
comparator could be coming because i
mean<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.670> might<00:04:51.880> not<00:04:52.030> be<00:04:52.090> coming<00:04:52.330> because<00:04:52.930> it

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
mean it might not be coming because it

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.420 
mean it might not be coming because it
needs<00:04:53.380> redstone<00:04:53.800> levels<00:04:54.070> become<00:04:54.190> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
resident update which has a whole bunch

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
of update stuff coming of it so if we

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.010 
of update stuff coming of it so if we
get<00:04:57.760> this<00:04:58.270> then<00:04:58.570> we're<00:04:58.690> going<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:58.990> a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
get this then we're going to have a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.830 
get this then we're going to have a
really<00:04:59.620> really<00:04:59.830> cool<00:04:59.950> exciting<00:05:00.340> time<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
really really cool exciting time so the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.270 
really really cool exciting time so the
redstone<00:05:02.170> comparator<00:05:02.290> what<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.830> does<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.220> it

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
redstone comparator what it does is it

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.940 
redstone comparator what it does is it
compares<00:05:03.790> two<00:05:04.060> signals<00:05:04.510> because<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.800> in

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
compares two signals because in the in

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.590 
compares two signals because in the in
the<00:05:05.980> update<00:05:06.340> where<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.640> came<00:05:06.760> in<00:05:06.970> basically

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the update where it came in basically

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.910 
the update where it came in basically
redstone<00:05:08.050> strength<00:05:08.290> can<00:05:08.440> be<00:05:08.470> at<00:05:08.620> multiple

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
redstone strength can be at multiple

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.740 
redstone strength can be at multiple

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
signals it can be anywhere from a string

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.420 
signals it can be anywhere from a string
of<00:05:10.870> strength<00:05:11.110> 12<00:05:11.530> signature<00:05:11.830> in<00:05:11.920> 15<00:05:12.280> because

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
of strength 12 signature in 15 because

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.400 
of strength 12 signature in 15 because
it<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:12.820> slows<00:05:13.270> down<00:05:13.480> as<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.780> goes<00:05:13.900> along<00:05:14.050> and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
it it slows down as it goes along and

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.480 
it it slows down as it goes along and
then<00:05:14.530> has<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.710> be<00:05:14.800> repeated<00:05:15.040> but<00:05:15.340> basically

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
then has to be repeated but basically

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.700 
then has to be repeated but basically
compares<00:05:15.850> two<00:05:16.060> signals<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.690> if<00:05:17.080> it's<00:05:17.230> got<00:05:17.620> the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
compares two signals and if it's got the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680 
compares two signals and if it's got the
red<00:05:17.830> light<00:05:18.010> on<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.460> will<00:05:18.580> compare<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.150> think<00:05:19.510> and

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
red light on it will compare I think and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.150 
red light on it will compare I think and
then<00:05:19.840> if<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.080> got<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.230> red<00:05:20.380> light<00:05:20.530> off<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.890> will

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
then if it's got a red light off it will

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.730 
then if it's got a red light off it will
you<00:05:21.550> know<00:05:21.670> I<00:05:22.090> also<00:05:22.960> track<00:05:23.290> one<00:05:23.500> from<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.710> other

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
you know I also track one from the other

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.680 
you know I also track one from the other
and<00:05:24.010> do<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.580> thing<00:05:24.790> it's<00:05:25.390> basically

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
and do that to the thing it's basically

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.850 
and do that to the thing it's basically
a<00:05:25.780> way<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.020> make<00:05:26.290> some<00:05:26.530> really<00:05:26.680> cool

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.640 
a way to make some really cool
contraptions<00:05:27.610> so<00:05:27.850> for<00:05:28.030> instance<00:05:28.200> if<00:05:29.200> one<00:05:29.530> of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
contraptions so for instance if one of

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.950 
contraptions so for instance if one of
these<00:05:29.830> is<00:05:30.250> like<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.300> can<00:05:31.420> make<00:05:31.720> it<00:05:31.840> so

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
these is like it you can make it so

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.590 
these is like it you can make it so
compares<00:05:32.380> they<00:05:32.710> like<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.220> whatever<00:05:33.610> liz<00:05:33.910> has<00:05:34.540> a

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
compares they like to whatever liz has a

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.050 
compares they like to whatever liz has a
few<00:05:34.870> cool<00:05:35.080> applications<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.490> needs<00:05:36.820> the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
few cool applications but it needs the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.640 
few cool applications but it needs the
redstone<00:05:37.390> update<00:05:37.480> so<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:37.900> really<00:05:38.350> don't<00:05:38.530> think

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
