part 2 on creating my galaxy effect
using<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.609> particle<00:00:18.000> system<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.220> let's<00:00:20.220> just

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
using the particle system and let's just

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
using the particle system and let's just
show<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.699> another<00:00:21.029> preview<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.720> real

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.730 
apologize halo size is the size of the
original<00:01:07.979> particle<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.080> prefer<00:01:10.080> mine<00:01:10.470> be

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
original particle I prefer mine be

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.740 
original particle I prefer mine be
really<00:01:11.520> small<00:01:13.580> like<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> hardness<00:01:16.890> high<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
really small like the hardness high and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.190 
really small like the hardness high and
the<00:01:18.750> ad<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.759> harden<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.270> kind

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
side to side um over here we have rings

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.560 
side to side um over here we have rings
lions<00:01:33.750> stars<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.740> seed<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.369> know<00:01:36.030> everything

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
lions stars and seed I know everything

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
lions stars and seed I know everything
except<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.290> seed<00:01:39.079> rings<00:01:40.079> lines<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.189> stars

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
except for seed rings lines and stars

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.660 
except for seed rings lines and stars
are<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> render<00:01:43.170> each<00:01:43.560> particle<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
are for when you render each particle is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
are for when you render each particle is
going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.079> many<00:01:46.229> rings

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
going to have that like that many rings

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.370 
going to have that like that many rings
in<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> main<00:01:47.310> lines<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> ma<00:01:48.030> stars<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
in it that main lines and ma stars so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
in it that main lines and ma stars so
over<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.369> select<00:01:50.490> which<00:01:50.820> ones<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
over here you can select which ones you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
over here you can select which ones you
want<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.600> prefer<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.770> only<00:01:52.920> render<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> lines

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
want I prefer to only render the lines

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.440 
want I prefer to only render the lines
and<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.439> very<00:01:56.159> few

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and to have very few

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.350 
and to have very few
like<00:01:58.450> six<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.250> if<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.460> increase<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> couple<00:02:01.240> of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
like six so if we increase a couple of

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.950 
like six so if we increase a couple of
frames<00:02:01.660> here<00:02:02.940> we've<00:02:03.940> been<00:02:04.150> do<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.960> see

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
frames here we've been do this and see

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.990 
frames here we've been do this and see
you<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.200> these<00:02:08.350> little<00:02:08.440> stars<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.790> stuff

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
you have these little stars and stuff

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400 
you have these little stars and stuff
let's<00:02:10.240> advance<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.630> couple<00:02:10.869> frames<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.260> get

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
let's advance a couple frames so we get

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.620 
let's advance a couple frames so we get
a<00:02:11.440> better<00:02:11.560> view

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.940 

sure<00:02:19.260> let's<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.250 

I<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.670> see<00:02:22.790> these<00:02:22.940> will<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.690> look<00:02:23.810> kind<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
I could see these will it look kind of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.740 
I could see these will it look kind of
like<00:02:24.319> little<00:02:24.610> stores<00:02:25.610> they're<00:02:26.420> actually<00:02:26.720> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
like little stores they're actually not

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.619 
like little stores they're actually not
there<00:02:27.349> bunch<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.980> lines<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.420> effect

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
there bunch of lines that's the effect

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.059 
there bunch of lines that's the effect
that<00:02:29.750> i<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.080> best<00:02:30.230> though<00:02:30.440> every<00:02:30.800> particle

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
that i like best though every particle

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.869 
that i like best though every particle
looks<00:02:31.400> pretty<00:02:31.700> much<00:02:31.849> separate<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:34.700> can

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
looks pretty much separate you can

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.180 
looks pretty much separate you can
render<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> stars<00:02:35.629> and<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.019> rings<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.890> then

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
render the stars and the rings and then

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.860 
render the stars and the rings and then
you<00:02:37.760> go<00:02:37.910> up<00:02:38.030> here<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.269> render<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:40.720> bit<00:02:41.720> more

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you go up here and render a bit more

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.400 
you go up here and render a bit more
blurry<00:02:42.170> has<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> lot<00:02:43.400> more<00:02:43.550> effects<00:02:43.849> in<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:47.410> as

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
blurry has a lot more effects in it as

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.009 
blurry has a lot more effects in it as
you<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.709> see<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.280> can<00:02:50.180> zoom<00:02:50.720> in<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.440> bit

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
you can see I can zoom in for you a bit

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.470 
you can see I can zoom in for you a bit
this<00:02:54.019> one<00:02:54.519> it's<00:02:55.519> more<00:02:55.760> blurred<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.299> don't

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
this one it's more blurred you don't

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.210 
this one it's more blurred you don't
have<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.630> more<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.019> like<00:02:57.349> a<00:02:57.380> solid<00:02:57.950> line

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
have a more of a like a solid line

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.770 
have a more of a like a solid line
effects<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:58.880> some<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.330> lines<00:02:59.540> right

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
effects you see some of the lines right

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.440 
effects you see some of the lines right
there<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.099> how<00:03:01.220> much<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.000> solid

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
there you know how much of a solid

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.559 
there you know how much of a solid
effect<00:03:03.370> close<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
effect close that so I just going to

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.449 
effect close that so I just going to
take<00:03:05.900> my<00:03:05.959> rings<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.769> star<00:03:07.640> away<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:10.040> over

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
take my rings and star away now over

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.190 
take my rings and star away now over
here<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.090> halo<00:03:11.299> color<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.870> line<00:03:12.049> in

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
here we have the halo color the line in

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.050 
here we have the halo color the line in
the<00:03:12.290> ring<00:03:12.440> color<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:13.190> need<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.430> worry<00:03:13.549> about

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
the ring color don't need to worry about

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.680 
the ring color don't need to worry about
ring<00:03:14.510> because<00:03:15.010> I'll<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.250> rings<00:03:16.459> select<00:03:16.790> so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
ring because I'll have rings select so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.589 
ring because I'll have rings select so
let's<00:03:18.260> start<00:03:18.709> with<00:03:18.799> our<00:03:18.890> halo<00:03:19.360> let's<00:03:20.360> make<00:03:20.569> it

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
let's start with our halo let's make it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.610 
let's start with our halo let's make it
a<00:03:20.720> dark<00:03:20.959> red<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.489> render<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.610> frame<00:03:22.849> to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
a dark red and render the frame to

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.979 
a dark red and render the frame to
exactly<00:03:24.620> explain<00:03:24.920> what<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.220> halo<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.840> let<00:03:26.840> me

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
exactly explain what the halo is let me

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.720 
exactly explain what the halo is let me
zoom<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.829> kind<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.510> glow<00:03:30.730> or

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
zoom in it's kind of like the glow or

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
zoom in it's kind of like the glow or
the<00:03:32.090> original<00:03:32.299> particle<00:03:32.989> which<00:03:33.109> is<00:03:33.290> kind<00:03:33.500> of

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
the original particle which is kind of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.240 
the original particle which is kind of
surrounding<00:03:34.130> everything

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.750 

now<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:38.270> we<00:03:38.570> go<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.680> line<00:03:39.920> here<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.610> can

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
now if we go to the line here we can

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.310 
now if we go to the line here we can
definitely<00:03:41.300> show<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.510> example<00:03:41.960> if<00:03:42.020> we<00:03:42.110> make

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
definitely show the example if we make

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.970 
definitely show the example if we make
this<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.790> blue<00:03:44.260> render<00:03:45.580> turn<00:03:46.580> frame<00:03:49.720> now

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
this on the blue render turn frame now

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.890 
this on the blue render turn frame now
not<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> stick<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.390> see<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> difference

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
not a stick you can see the difference

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.560 
not a stick you can see the difference
between<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.230> lines<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.190> halo

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
between the lines in that and the halo

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.270 
between the lines in that and the halo
so<00:03:56.570> if<00:03:56.630> we<00:03:56.750> go<00:03:56.959> out<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.560> we<00:03:57.680> increase

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
so if we go out of that and we increase

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.980 
so if we go out of that and we increase
the<00:03:58.310> halo<00:03:58.850> sighs<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> bit<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> make<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.870> little

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
the halo sighs a bit to make it a little

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.910 
the halo sighs a bit to make it a little
more<00:04:00.110> easy<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.620> see<00:04:01.330> rear-ended<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.450> frame

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
more easy to see rear-ended that frame

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.140 
more easy to see rear-ended that frame
now<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:03.980> can<00:04:04.190> get<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.340> little<00:04:04.640> bit<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.820> a<00:04:04.940> better

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
now you can get a little bit of a better

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.650 
now you can get a little bit of a better
example<00:04:06.790> I'll<00:04:07.790> show<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> looks<00:04:08.390> like<00:04:08.540> with

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
example I'll show you it looks like with

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.940 
example I'll show you it looks like with
a<00:04:08.690> very<00:04:09.500> high<00:04:10.480> halo<00:04:11.480> size<00:04:14.500> now<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.709> gives<00:04:15.800> you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
a very high halo size now that gives you

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.409 
a very high halo size now that gives you
a<00:04:16.010> good<00:04:16.130> example<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.640> halos<00:04:16.940> more<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
a good example the halos more like the

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.330 
a good example the halos more like the
original<00:04:17.540> particle<00:04:18.140> with<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.290> glow<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.859> then

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
original particle with the glow and then

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.949 
original particle with the glow and then
the<00:04:19.459> lines<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:19.970> see<00:04:20.269> sticking<00:04:20.570> out<00:04:20.810> of

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
the lines you can see sticking out of

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.870 
the lines you can see sticking out of
every<00:04:21.230> single<00:04:21.560> particle<00:04:21.980> like<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.730> has

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
every single particle like that one has

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.510 
every single particle like that one has
a<00:04:22.940> couple<00:04:23.210> lines<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.660> through<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.520> you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
a couple lines going through it and you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.220 
a couple lines going through it and you
know<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.640> actually<00:04:26.000> pretty<00:04:26.360> much<00:04:26.450> randomizes

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
know it actually pretty much randomizes

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.770 
know it actually pretty much randomizes
through<00:04:27.380> each<00:04:27.500> particle<00:04:28.330> randomly<00:04:29.330> generated

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
through each particle randomly generated

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.510 
through each particle randomly generated
you<00:04:29.870> can't<00:04:30.110> find<00:04:30.380> any<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:31.100> look<00:04:31.220> pretty

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
you can't find any to that look pretty

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.540 
you can't find any to that look pretty
much<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.700> same<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:33.230> get<00:04:33.290> out<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.440> that

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.409 

hold<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.730> second<00:04:38.240> not<00:04:39.080> refreshing<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:41.270> it

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
hold on a second not refreshing if it

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.850 
hold on a second not refreshing if it
stopped<00:04:41.720> responding<00:04:42.140> that's<00:04:42.530> pretty<00:04:42.710> much

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
stopped responding that's pretty much

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.659 
stopped responding that's pretty much
all<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.070> have<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.490> know<00:04:45.010> blender<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:46.250> closed

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
all you have to know blender just closed

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.770 
all you have to know blender just closed
on<00:04:46.940> me<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:49.300> must've<00:04:50.300> somehow

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
on me so I must've somehow

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.340 
on me so I must've somehow
double-clicked<00:04:51.770> apparently<00:04:52.370> um<00:04:53.229> that's<00:04:54.229> all

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
double-clicked apparently um that's all

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.659
