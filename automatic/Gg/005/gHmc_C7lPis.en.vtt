Chris's<00:01:06.490> point<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.720> make<00:01:07.899> matters<00:01:08.080> worse<00:01:08.530> he's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
Chris's point to make matters worse he's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.410 
Chris's point to make matters worse he's
also<00:01:09.070> made<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.399> version<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.940> jingle<00:01:10.180> bells

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420

also made a version of jingle bells
that's<00:01:10.869> pretty<00:01:11.170> awful<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.619> its<00:01:11.770> own<00:01:11.950> let<00:01:12.550> alone

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
that's pretty awful on its own let alone

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.820 
that's pretty awful on its own let alone
when<00:01:13.180> played<00:01:13.450> with<00:01:13.660> in<00:01:13.780> nine<00:01:14.020> different<00:01:14.290> media

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830

when played with in nine different media
plays<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:20.200> didn't<00:01:20.380> really<00:01:20.560> sound<00:01:20.770> very<00:01:21.070> good

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
plays just didn't really sound very good

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.820 
plays just didn't really sound very good
very<00:01:21.610> chaotic<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.420> think<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.259> best<00:01:23.500> thing<00:01:23.619> is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
very chaotic I think the best thing is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.139 
very chaotic I think the best thing is
for<00:01:23.860> all<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.130> these<00:01:24.369> players<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.880> play<00:01:25.030> in

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
for all of these players to play in

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.840 
for all of these players to play in
harmony<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:26.500> made<00:01:26.830> four<00:01:27.160> different<00:01:27.520> videos

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
harmony so I made four different videos

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.550 
harmony so I made four different videos
about<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.300> true<00:01:28.540> meaning<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.900> Christmas<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
about the true meaning of Christmas and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.360 
about the true meaning of Christmas and
here<00:01:30.340> they<00:01:30.460> are<00:01:30.490> played<00:01:31.240> together
