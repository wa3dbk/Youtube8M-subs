00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 the medical diplomacy of Cuba 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.210
 I entered the times without frontiers that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.150
 tomorrow, the sociologist Julius 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 fante silva she for more than 30 years 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.970
 Cuban medicine studies this issue 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.189
 Cuban doctors to the then around the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 world is not a very large number 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.330
 doctors is very interesting. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.869
 this story because when the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 revolution is half of the doctors in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 cuba half escaped to miami as it remained 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.890
 with only three thousand doctors and only had 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 14 university professors from 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
 threat of medicine end up in medicine 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 but the very large investment was 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 which will lead to the fact that he was a doctor 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 this system of medicine change make a 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.980
 community medicine in the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 large number of doctors are to live 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.410
 within communities and make a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 preventive medicine and gave some cuba 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.750
 today have comparable health 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.000
 even better than the United States 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.470
 in the country of europe with my country of the world 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 which has the highest number of per- 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.680
 capita is 12 7% one thing 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.650
 extraordinary three times a year 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.250
 that the states themselves and with 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 doctors for decades has been 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 send medical teams to countries 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.630
 to countries where there are disasters 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.520
 is a program that is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 considered by the World Health 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.619
 health as a model for the rest of the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.380
 world to são joão gonçalves would like 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.750
 the Cuban model 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.390
 was noted by other countries 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 in which the doctor lives within the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.450
 community where the doctor is 24 hours 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 to the patients in that place 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.520
 where I live is very interesting the system 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.750
 and now Brazilians will live with 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.659
 these doctors 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.509
 so what she says is that in many 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.640
 countries such as venezuela in bolivia 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.079
 where there are a large number of 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.670
 of human physicians 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.490
 there was enormous resistance from 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.369
 associations of local doctors as is 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.549
 happening in Brazil because because there are 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.250
 resistance to changing the model is a 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.890
 different model is a much more 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 much more communitarian, then there is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.540
 enormous resistance of the doctors were 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.299
 formed within another model is 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 this innovation is a revolution in 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.170
 medicine 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 so she explains why there are so many 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 more resistance than many countries like 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.650
 venezuela is night in south africa 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.109
 the middle banks ended up getting very 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 and the people who are served 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.450
 with them, millions of 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.670
 people in the world have benefited 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.650
 600 thousand cases of blindness even caused 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.540
 due to vitamin deficiency were 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.569
 treated and cured by Cuban doctors 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.160
 in Africa is something that people 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.940
 have to take off the hat 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.920
 human medicine is an example for a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.799
 good and just remembering that without timely ae 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.010
 frontiers with our point Jorge goes 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.540
 air tomorrow at 11 midnight and not 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.540
 lose in Brazil
