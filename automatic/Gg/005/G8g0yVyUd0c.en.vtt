sword and it makes this like sideways
wave<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.889> gravity<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.510> that's<00:04:13.199> pretty<00:04:13.440> fucking

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
wave of gravity so that's pretty fucking

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.830 
wave of gravity so that's pretty fucking
cool<00:04:13.769> his<00:04:14.310> ability<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:14.940> limited<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.569> just

he said gravity sword he said gravis or

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.470 
he said gravity sword he said gravis or
does<00:04:28.410> his<00:04:28.740> sword<00:04:29.100> actually<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.270> devil

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the ability he's just using a sword with

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.710 
the ability he's just using a sword with
his<00:04:36.990> ability<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.560> create<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.550> motion<00:04:39.540> and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
his ability to create that motion and

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.830 
his ability to create that motion and
that<00:04:40.080> force<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.830> push<00:04:41.400> shit<00:04:42.120> back<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.660> stuff

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
that force and push shit back and stuff

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.140 
that force and push shit back and stuff
like<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.020> right<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.830> could<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.370> he<00:04:45.030> has

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.910 
like that right but it could be he has
the<00:04:45.300> ability<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.810> he's<00:04:46.410> just<00:04:46.650> using<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
the ability and he's just using the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.260 
the ability and he's just using the
sword<00:04:47.100> he<00:04:47.220> called<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.520> gravity<00:04:47.880> sword<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.180> know

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
sword he called a gravity sword you know

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.850 
sword he called a gravity sword you know
whatever<00:04:48.600> that's<00:04:48.960> what<00:04:49.110> I'm<00:04:49.200> leaning<00:04:49.500> towards

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
whatever that's what I'm leaning towards

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.790 
whatever that's what I'm leaning towards
I'm<00:04:50.130> leaning<00:04:50.580> towards<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:52.140> he<00:04:52.680> has

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
I'm leaning towards that I think he has

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.350 
I'm leaning towards that I think he has
a<00:04:52.830> devil<00:04:53.160> fruit<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.580> he<00:04:53.670> was<00:04:53.820> using<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.120> sword

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
a devil fruit and he was using a sword

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.180 
a devil fruit and he was using a sword
along<00:04:55.050> with<00:04:55.260> his<00:04:55.350> devil<00:04:55.620> fruit<00:04:55.650> sort<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.100> like

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
along with his devil fruit sort of like

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.340 
along with his devil fruit sort of like
Walter<00:04:56.580> fogger<00:04:57.000> law<00:04:57.180> uses<00:04:57.570> his<00:04:57.690> sword<00:04:57.990> along

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
Walter fogger law uses his sword along

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.230 
Walter fogger law uses his sword along
with<00:04:58.380> his<00:04:58.710> devil<00:04:59.070> fruit<00:04:59.100> his<00:04:59.400> sword<00:04:59.700> does<00:05:00.000> not

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
with his devil fruit his sword does not

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.510 
with his devil fruit his sword does not
have<00:05:00.480> his<00:05:00.660> devil<00:05:00.990> fruit<00:05:01.020> he<00:05:01.350> can't<00:05:01.620> just<00:05:02.340> you

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
have his devil fruit he can't just you

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.710 
have his devil fruit he can't just you
know<00:05:02.610> spice<00:05:02.970> things<00:05:03.210> up<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.480> stuff<00:05:03.510> like<00:05:03.660> that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
know spice things up and stuff like that

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570 
know spice things up and stuff like that
he<00:05:03.870> could<00:05:03.990> do<00:05:04.080> other<00:05:04.260> shit<00:05:04.410> but<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.310> sword

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
he could do other shit but the sword

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.690 
he could do other shit but the sword
allows<00:05:05.970> him<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.660> be<00:05:07.590> sort<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:07.920> precise<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.580> do

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
allows him to be sort of precise and do

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.270 
allows him to be sort of precise and do
a<00:05:08.730> specific<00:05:09.240> thing<00:05:09.540> along<00:05:10.140> with<00:05:10.470> his<00:05:10.920> devil

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
a specific thing along with his devil

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.400 
a specific thing along with his devil
fruit<00:05:11.310> abilities<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.210> think<00:05:12.360> fujitora<00:05:13.140> is

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
fruit abilities so I think fujitora is

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.000 
fruit abilities so I think fujitora is
more<00:05:13.710> like<00:05:13.980> law<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:15.180> don't<00:05:15.690> think<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.710> sword

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
more like law I don't think the sword

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.890 
more like law I don't think the sword
actually<00:05:17.460> has<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.880> ability<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.390> lot<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.810> people

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
actually has the ability a lot of people

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.210 
actually has the ability a lot of people
have<00:05:19.140> been<00:05:19.170> saying<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.710> or<00:05:19.890> actually<00:05:20.130> has

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
have been saying this or actually has

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
have been saying this or actually has
the<00:05:20.250> ability<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.790> mean<00:05:21.060> he<00:05:21.210> yelled<00:05:21.420> gravity

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
the ability but I mean he yelled gravity

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.080 
the ability but I mean he yelled gravity
sword<00:05:22.320> so<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.710> guess<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.400> guess<00:05:23.700> it's<00:05:23.880> possible

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
sword so I guess I guess it's possible

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.630 
sword so I guess I guess it's possible
for<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.900> sword<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.590> actually<00:05:25.950> be<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.400> thing

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
for the sword to actually be the thing

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.909 
for the sword to actually be the thing
with<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.150> devil<00:05:27.630> furred<00:05:27.960> ability<00:05:28.620> which

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
with the devil furred ability which

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.630 
with the devil furred ability which
would<00:05:29.730> be<00:05:29.880> really<00:05:30.030> weird<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:31.040> sort<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.250> break

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
would be really weird and sort of break

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.940 
would be really weird and sort of break
down<00:05:32.880> what<00:05:33.240> we<00:05:33.450> thought<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.470> really<00:05:34.919> I

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
down what we thought and I really I

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.510 
down what we thought and I really I
wouldn't<00:05:35.760> like<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.740> because<00:05:37.740> there's<00:05:38.400> no

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
wouldn't like that because there's no

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.950 
wouldn't like that because there's no
consciousness<00:05:39.000> how<00:05:39.390> does<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.660> ability

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
consciousness how does the ability

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.720 
consciousness how does the ability
