00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.860
 we are inspired by the universes 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.360
 traditional does not make sense always 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.980
 It has been very exciting to take our 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.380
 game but we did in his life can 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.640
 be for example many furniture and the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.990
 truth is that we carry letters 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.550
 collectibles and the part of the 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 logical evolution of the brand in all 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 our card players 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 classics 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.790
 your issues and questions that with the fact 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
 that both we and they are like 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 panel we were very visited with the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.270
 possibility of doing something together of that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.270
 ground then the base if a decision 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 easy 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.219
 and they represent a totally 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.469
 different 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.909
 there are hundreds more used to a 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.909
 product that is long the game 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.530
 is a product of a certain time by 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.909
 go through that store etc. instead 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.590
 happy point after houses 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.810
 professionals the dynamics totally 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.729
 different things much more let's say 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.070
 chaotic many animals and the kids 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.630
 to exchange cards in the cole van 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.799
 to do games go do for days 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 both physically and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.579
 the interesting thing is that all the magic and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.680
 all the mystique of the universe 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.119
 the usual kids we start 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.510
 producing therefore to continue in front of 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.980
 letters we also like 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.400
 sectors is here to dispense the 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.400
 incorporated 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.590
 we have transported 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.780
 at the same time one thing that is 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.280
 completely new is the mixture of a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.660
 totally physical game with a game 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.940
 totally virtual because for example 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.120
 be Aragon and you have the illusion that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.960
 it had happened so you can put it up that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.960
 we have with all platforms 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.000
 s &amp; p and we also have to transform them into 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.680
 two ways and two you can have in 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.300
 direct where that combat has increased 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.260
 between those two letters that is what I change 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.360
 happening 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 we think that in summary is a game that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.470
 It has many slopes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.379
 and at the same time through all 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.430
 look at our above all that it is a game 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.650
 slightly younger slightly more 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.650
 open let's say the games 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.870
 magic problems on the other hand I feel 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 that in that tactical depth that over 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.760
 three types in that sense since we have 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.060
 mechanisms of the mechanisms of 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.040
 evolution of the change mechanisms of 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.040
 one creature for another because we are 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:01.329
 which is also not aware of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.680
 eliminate from memory what was designating 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.840
 memorizing anything because directly 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.879
 all the information is visually in 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.540
 the board has been fulfilled in what 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.760
 state is the game 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.780
 we think that in that sense possibly 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.690
 this can make people who have not 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.490
 ever played 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.530
 solvable because it seemed diversity 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.750
 the trees may be raised 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.769
 only of cards with a curve of 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.769
 light entrance 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.920
 when I'm thinking that in the end every 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.740
 and pending currency features that 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.000
 do you have 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.190
 think that we have more 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.600
 installed 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.600
 and it is to that base 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.880
 that will be our main let's say the 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:54.230
 community players from there the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.230
 people that are going to be any of the 600 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.370
 think what has happened here and now I am 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.889
 designing 13 not designed we make the king 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.389
 it's 45 years that sense we consider ourselves 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.370
 heirs but it is also we consider 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.680
 enhancers of everything that already existed 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.849
 before that it seemed our songs 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.530
 We have obviously looked at everything 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.160
 exist and we have tried to take it to 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.720
 next level 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.599
 in that sense I hope that lately 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.130
 this this person with glasses see 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.110
 clearly there are improvements innovations 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.590
 that make this something better than 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.590
 the futures 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.180
 Yes always 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.340
 these days we're going to see that 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.080
 constitutionally we previously 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.060
 We are known for supporting all 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.180
 community initiatives 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.310
 you should be present before others 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.320
 powerful throws a tremendous fact 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.070
 by sonny by panini think that we 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.200
 every time we have done something 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.729
 of construction colomos 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.050
 we have been a triple say 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.939
 we hope to be exactly the same 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.919
 if you are obviously going to give 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:09.169
 all the necessary support either everything 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.059
 less either booster expansion part 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.059
 packs in usual farm
