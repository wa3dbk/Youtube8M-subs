thermoforming<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.580> TST<00:00:21.180> allows<00:00:21.900> us<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> make<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
thermoforming or TST allows us to make a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.019 
thermoforming or TST allows us to make a
stand<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.800> paddleboard<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.550> lighter<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
stand up paddleboard that is lighter and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.679 
stand up paddleboard that is lighter and

stiffer than other polyethylene s ups

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.390 
stiffer than other polyethylene s ups
one<00:00:27.689> reason<00:00:28.020> for<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.529> TST<00:00:29.160> allows

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
one reason for this is that TST allows

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
one reason for this is that TST allows
us<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> use<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.850> higher<00:00:30.119> grade<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> plastic<00:00:30.930> than

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
us to use a higher grade of plastic than

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.400 
us to use a higher grade of plastic than
