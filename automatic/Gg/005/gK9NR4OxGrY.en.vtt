00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
hole because that leads to radioactive

hole because that leads to radioactive
water<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.620> eighth<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.310> final<00:03:33.760> key<00:03:34.150> is

the flaming torches just outside there

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.090 
the flaming torches just outside there
and<00:03:43.050> it's<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:44.110> your<00:03:44.470> right<00:03:44.650> when<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.980> get

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
into the door and just okay I guess my

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.800 
into the door and just okay I guess my
game<00:03:48.640> cut<00:03:48.880> out<00:03:48.970> here<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.390> bit<00:03:49.570> but

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
game cut out here for a bit but

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.630 
game cut out here for a bit but
basically<00:03:50.530> run<00:03:50.709> across<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.070> other<00:03:51.160> side<00:03:51.430> of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
basically run across the other side of

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.729 
basically run across the other side of
the<00:03:51.820> water<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.020> safes<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.650> your

the water and the safes just on your

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.550 
the water and the safes just on your
left<00:03:53.950> your<00:03:54.130> compass<00:03:54.520> it<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.900> there<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.989> go<00:03:56.110> 15

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
left your compass it and there you go 15

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.680 
left your compass it and there you go 15
games<00:03:56.800> thought<00:03:57.040> safecracker<00:03:57.640> easy<00:03:58.090> as<00:03:58.330> that

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690
