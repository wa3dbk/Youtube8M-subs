00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.020
 the most important 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.020
 you have to go to your university you should inform yourself 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.969
 with the people who coordinate their degree 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.919
 and on that information make the decision and in any case 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.460
 will depend is the decision 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.060
 how the audience has proposed the implementation of the new degree 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.449
 ue there are situations that can happen all current 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.249
 has achieved letter 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.950
 is that only the first course is implemented next year 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 and therefore in that case the student will have the right 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.840
 lasts to finish the degree that started in his day with the curriculum with 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 the one who promised 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.809
 is going to find a university that will think more 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.040
 in the student 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.080
 pumas seven 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.360
 who learns 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.950
 how he learns 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.610
 and what he learns 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.070
 that who teaches how to teach 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.150
 and who teaches 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.870
 what is going to find a university that will have driven by the realization 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.750
 of the practices 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690
 is going to meet with a university 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.810
 that will reinforce knowledge training 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.200
 with a disability training 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 and I hope that also in values 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.890
 a student who maintains a commitment to the university to follow his or her plan 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 studies 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.350
 is going to meet with a faculty 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.340
 concerned about 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 the renewal of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.330
 of student attention 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.520
 a mentor that percent those benefits of the process so denies 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.290
 which are being applied too 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.320
 to the students enrolled in the current degrees 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.700
 therefore within the planning of your curriculum 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.980
 you will find with your own and improvements 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 of attention to the student in each of the centers 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 the percent student is going to find 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.210
 with a plan 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.550
 a measure in terms of effort and recognition of the work he does 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.319
 therefore a student will perceive 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.349
 what for me some years the most beautiful of his life 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.389
 in your work as workers will be with the student procession 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.709
 was going to have a recognition in terms of credits 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.700
 that are valued with a number of working hours 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.219
 Student's jump 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.519
 and wherever the formative stage goes, but also with 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.009
 posteriority 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:00.029
 the recognizable reservoir that training that knowledge and those capabilities 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.530
 that have been acquired 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.869
 along d happened 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.869
 by the university system 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.320
 this debate 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.590
 murcia took place for a long time percent in particular in the council 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.339
 of university coordination that was called 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.059
 at the time 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:28.999
 l the agreement at the European level was allowed the flexibility center degrees 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.099
 of 180 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.379
 and branches of 240 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.839
 and enter Spain has adopted 240 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:37.040
 In my opinion 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.499
 judging by how events have evolved 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.999
 rightly there countries at this time 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:49.119
 that they adopted the 180 and at this moment they are evaluating that it falls short for 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.909
 the objectives that 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.909
 they want to achieve with the reform and therefore 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.469
 In my opinion 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.549
 very successful decision of 240 and adopted by those who could adopt 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.549
 at the time 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:13.329
 With no rotundity, no one in the current system will lose any 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.599
 straight 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.940
 nor of academic nature measures nature 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.819
 labor 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.909
 the reform as always 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:25.409
 but it guarantees the maintenance and preservation of these rights
