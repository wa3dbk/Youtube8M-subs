00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this one there and then make shapes all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.070 
this one there and then make shapes all
the<00:01:13.560> way<00:01:13.680> till<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> other<00:01:14.790> wheels<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.420 
over there and go like this all the way
around<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> way<00:01:50.130> here

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
around and go again all the way here

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.510 
around and go again all the way here
though<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.979> again

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to close this one off to make it look

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170 
to close this one off to make it look
better<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> rest<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.759> clay<00:02:02.969> in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
better so that is the rest a clay in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.429 
better so that is the rest a clay in
place<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.579> we<00:02:05.579> made<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> mistake<00:02:06.200> we've<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
