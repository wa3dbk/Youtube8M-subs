00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.459 
tablet for your avatar this is some like
little<00:00:40.710> verizon<00:00:41.489> promotion<00:00:42.230> i'm<00:00:43.230> guessing

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
little verizon promotion i'm guessing

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
little verizon promotion i'm guessing
they're<00:00:43.770> making<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> tablet<00:00:44.640> call<00:00:45.149> me<00:00:45.300> crazy

they're making a tablet call me crazy

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.290 
they're making a tablet call me crazy
but<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.379> assumption<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.440> over

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
but that's my assumption so you go over

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.220 
but that's my assumption so you go over
you<00:00:51.300> click<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.870> obviously<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.170> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you click on it obviously now this is
