00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 what followed is that as the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.049
 important position because one can say 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 but because he is not pulled to stay there 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 like the first one I did because 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.250
 as this is a position a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.150
 a little bit narrower than the first, that is, if 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 had pulled 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 if I had pulled this this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.560
 you have to stay there it would be sold 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.119
 tight is the way to pull it ie with 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 all the effect on the right in the head 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 following with this strength he has it 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.810
 enlarged just enough for sure 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.059
 because if we are pulled to stay 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 in this case with the dot here you see 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.300
 the game is to come do the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 card this part is the cue ball 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 we put there instead of nell'angolino 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
 this is very useful for this shot 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.530
 being able to go for a ball of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 four with his own then go it to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 that is, to look for and not to carry it we can 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 to show and bring the adversary to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 angle then put in the well 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 position for the more fair Marians 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.660
 yes no a sheet of the century is at home 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.430
 so we see them the same execution 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 but with a dot in the opposite corner 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 to see why ios this case 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 the fact the full let it go to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.080
 because this is the path of mine 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.740
 life in the position he was owed 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 by force 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.659
 starting from here he had to come 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 normal lard instead I first for 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.060
 get to the bathroom just made 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.590
 paralyzed 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.380
 however the same came to the fore, that is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.780
 fact 8 depends no then clearly is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 very important to evaluate a year later 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 another nice group in my opinion is one 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.659
 position of this type 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.890
 always with the ball or here or here 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 a tour of this type too 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 see many players tonight a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.579
 home will be happy because they see 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.619
 so many went to moralize well 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.630
 marbles position can be done 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.729
 just what I say as then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 this is a shot as we see well that 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.900
 you can not attract the ride because there 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.060
 then comes why in this case 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.550
 around the hyper ball so there is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 cost 20 give if one is the player 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.130
 good see it immediately this position e 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.960
 he recognizes that he has less good lalalala 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 will learn is a difficult position 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.040
 there is no crossbar there is the banner 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.140
 proportion that is a little population 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.270
 difficult on the lap if and as of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.440
 usually used to say that one had 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.330
 luck is true because it actually is 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 solution that can and can be 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.170
 play in a group with our che 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.500
 pass by here and come to the corner e 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.540
 the other that makes the group bn history of the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.030
 father now clearly the important e 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 dodge roll here is not said that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.040
 come immediately but this is done as 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.440
 slightly left effect not 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.630
 too much because otherwise we start again 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.080
 from the race that you will have to find long 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.080
 long to go there and the portion of the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.709
 shovel that would be from here it would seem to me 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.480
 half a ball proves this is 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.519
 wrong because the test came 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 let go in the vault the course is 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.300
 this is what the nine values ​​are 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.459
 bad to show that clearly 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.010
 she wanted at all on the lake because I am 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.900
 arrived at the ball of three 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.760
 we forgive it then we do that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 let's forgive though this is let's say can't 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.560
 in short supply tanoh always serious they are 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.450
 brought maybe go to the side of the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.670
 reason is called that we now find 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.980
 the dinner to be a bit more on the ball 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.980
 big bit bigger 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.530
 exact in this case came for a long time 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 best I did 8 because that castle 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.769
 where 48 you made 12 had come 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.090
 perfect we were gone again by 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.700
 be foul but this shot too 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.349
 slight effect to the left is sought 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.870
 of there are so many variations if up 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.510
 these are positions that I or I are e 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.849
 need friends at home to start 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.950
 try these tv though if the location 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.660
 it's not really like i put it in 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.769
 change something like that also on 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.140
 same what we do 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.450
 we say this immediately afterwards though now 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.250
 an advertising contribution arrives vi 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.450
 let's leave just for a few moments 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.450
 and we hear them later 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.870
 so here we are again together 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.370
 you hear we talked about the circle then 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.120
 we talked about that group you 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.150
 you said 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.570
 in the sixth in the seventh shore singha 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.430
 panders and comes back 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.460
 then I wanted it to fail 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 chance to shoot a shot does not come 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.220
 never really will not see why I do not have 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.320
 found nothing nor piria the many banks 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.060
 here it takes just strength that there is also 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.340
 the arm that make me new banks 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.560
 watched gone look at this shot 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.060
 I'm Michael, don't let me look at you 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.060
 because it is really very beautiful 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.230
 here we made we have suffered no 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.550
 immediately made father immediately unfortunately 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.230
 we made the points on delight yes 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.950
 finds it again because this is it 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.740
 a show 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.540
 then I know that at home many friends will 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.250
 reacts want in return that foul 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.020
 that we are doing live but 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:32.150
 look at this guy that's nice 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:34.070
 difficult to do it in force marco here's it 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.070
 clearly on who wanted it 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.230
 we needed a ball of failure this is 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.270
 really not like leaves really a 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.820
 nice shot there is champion who says sure 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.860
 that therefore as strength is difficult 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.010
 clearly can be done with the two 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.060
 without because there is heaven because it exists 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.490
 this stage 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.610
 remember that the kidnapper in northern Italy 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.100
 keep saying it and it doesn't always turn out it's a 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.600
 great cloth and that is why it gives you 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.970
 the possibility of even turning 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.260
 so much sahin stop a second you know 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.420
 what the champion told me when he is 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.490
 arrived I told him so but this one 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.440
 it is always usual cloth yes because during 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.930
 body remained as beautiful as it used to be 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:19.340
 mounted and the truth 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:21.140
 let's do it go and do it between 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.300
 sensor nono strained the arm because 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.930
 it's really difficult then be careful 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.430
 we talked flat, don't get yourself 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.860
 bad you have seen umbertino anyway 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.050
 this new backgrounds I said good pulls 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.580
 shooting to lose certain because the theme 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.950
 said I don't have to say what we should do 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.200
 pull in production but this is that 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.510
 it should not be wider than forgetting 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.060
 productive if above despair 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.920
 no one many high their real 's 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.840
 michele we talked at the beginning 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.060
 we said to friends that we are 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.130
 then managed to go to Pistoia 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.650
 we managed to get well e 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.210
 we did so we recorded 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.200
 this small contribution because it is 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.110
 due 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.180
 we are now in the many weeks 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.010
 our company with billiards and for 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.960
 friends of billiards and also a duty 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.670
 remember certain appointments 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.900
 this was really a date 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.340
 important 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.920
 then we send you this contribution 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:17.800
 looked and then we get together and we have 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.800
 sample that genes that paws then
