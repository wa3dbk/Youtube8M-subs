00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.950
 you have ten fingers 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.219
 then click on the green church 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.419
 thank you 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.469
 as high as when it comes to a very good day every day 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.960
 with the new portion of facts and a new portion of culture that knows 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.689
 of course again on the 69 offtake to fiod rock albums with the jaja with a pgb 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 57 i know it is bp the wbp says the rules in the netherlands 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.910
 but we have nothing, I also have something on your own plan b temple that was 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.100
 also the first month of black ops 2 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.790
 when it did not have many views 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 because I was then still hot and relatively small 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.359
 and I just decided to take a banned one more time here 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.440
 because I like it myself and pévèle but look it is a full 

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:49.829
 activities i played p2 57 i play with yuri vicarie river being on 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.829
 and I make it and those ten really completely broken I had ten flack 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.160
 actors and I already final score of 12,000 400 km 35 points and that is real 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.540
 good see that is 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.670
 really for me just participated in scooter game play fun 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.980
 and those guys but go straight to the first keg 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.950
 the first achievement is sexsomnia some wessans can do that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 disorder called sexsomnia that means 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.729
 have sex while you sleep 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.409
 Some people just sleep here and I suddenly got it 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.609
 we get them the celebration so that they have to let someone want to ride a bike or that 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.009
 she got to leave the ek and this is just to sleep and then they go 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.180
 that suddenly do and sometimes just with the partner who then beats 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 outside the gor always just humpie dumpie humphrey 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.660
 I don't know what they do 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.140
 But it is a very strange condition, however, one percent of people who do 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 has this and that is still her day what people have that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.399
 And yes for comparison sleep walking there do about 20 percent of people 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.630
 and one percent of people who suffer from sex somnia and so on 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.200
 that can therefore be protected forms 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.750
 so they can just empty in bed and suddenly I start to pull or 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.549
 so just on a par space 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.100
 Another fact is that the man arrested us at an airport because of them 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.710
 thought he had a gun 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 his doctors took him to the back room to examine him 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.780
 but it turned out not to be a weapon that turned out to be just his penis 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 so that man who was yes I do not know if he was happy or something but I would see it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.290
 as a compliment if they think your water ajax its staff is a different fact 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.890
 that there really is for a world championship chair dance is me 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.439
 had no idea that it existed 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.199
 but apparently if you win the world championship seat dancing then 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.430
 you can earn $ 100,000 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 well i know what i would do i would really like it because if 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.290
 you earn a hundred thousand euros in one go on a hundred thousand dollars 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.800
 the ordinary and prefer to share a seat dance well then you are quite inside 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.630
 and then you don't have to do anything for a while or simply continue working 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.869
 but at least pretty good and if you participate every year 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.559
 in india just yes 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.729
 wins even though this is very difficult 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.359
 a world championship chair dance when i heard it i really thought of what the 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.089
 courses is really a world championship for chairs, they 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.150
 make that exist and you can also just win one hundred thousand euros below 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.339
 a thousand dollars sorry 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.489
 and you really like it if you just win in addition and I already know 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.149
 what you are going to think about there he came again to rape 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.269
 yeah i know i've been talking about dolphins last week 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.929
 now I have found something again apparently raped win 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.180
 intermediate stations baby seals 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.920
 and if done that the last seals suspect I don't know why 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.040
 those sea otters do that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.200
 but went wrong size the seals as an enemy or so but at least like that 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.340
 so they find those seals then 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.150
 occasionally 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.069
 raping see those baby seals and then showcases is common 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.370
 it is really hard for words what they do but yes nature will 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.829
 wellbeing and so it will run smoothly until I am going further now you must be cool 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.409
 that unsafe construction last week I think it's all fine as long as there 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.019
 but does not come across or process but have nothing to do with it but yes this 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.090
 happened and I think I'm moving to America 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.770
 what is really sad for words but you better drink in a coma 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.880
 and yet everyone just does things and sees if they are more than barak obama 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.939
 because snooki vandeurzen short that deserves 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.590
 just more like barrack obama 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.070
 You can hear the well done Obama the President of America who deserves it 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.829
 just less 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.680
 was that too 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.350
 and I find that really sad for words that those snookers go deeper each 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.100
 day really totally laplazerus who has a bit of a fight with some people 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.379
 and he still has kids sex and often not good anymore 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.509
 then it also becomes because it is too sad for the president of words 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.129
 America that is busy every day to keep the country as safe as possible and 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.689
 to bring everything 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.220
 just deserves less dutevi snooki I have not noticed 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.410
 then all separate subjects and also a reason to prove 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.680
 that the world is really very sad at the moment 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.470
 is that every three seconds 23 girls know about jazz team bieber 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.699
 that is related 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.029
 Aantjes the beer market 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:43.160
 every three seconds 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.750
 23 girls 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.879
 just what the fa cup 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.710
 and besides 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.470
 the total playing time of world of warcraft is currently almost 6 million 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.960
 For years you can see how many people 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.689
 how long people played that for six million years 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.449
 it's really just super much 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.599
 ns a 7 numerous lawsuits a lot of time that i have nothing against world of warcraft 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:03.949
 ear 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.319
 so six million years in the jets in terms of playing time 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.149
 oil box that it may not be good at stake as well as myself I have 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:12.979
 never played but 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.449
 really normal for 6 million years 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.029
 way too many there are also some weird facts about how people 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.900
 can die so there is a 25 year old woman from melbourne 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.930
 australia has 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.590
 drowned when she gave her husband a blow gosh what the falco you can in it 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.629
 drowning 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.830
 she does something wrong why 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.759
 don't you fly 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.210
 you just swallow it too high or so you get it in your theater or maybe 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.089
 it happened that swallowing or choking all went well 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.360
 and new life 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 why do you repress that? 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.919
 gosh what the courses and in addition to japan there are about two thousand every year 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.300
 kill by wearing program field 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.460
 and I don't know what they do with those high heels or they'll get stuck there 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.460
 six weeks and so on employed at oslo 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.280
 or via e-mail 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.710
 I really would not know it all but there was what needs to be done 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.880
 happen to cause 2,000 deaths that wearing high heels only really 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.550

 whatever the subjects, there are 150 deaths each year 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.639
 150 people are killed by falling coconuts or simply falling coconuts 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.319
 the year 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.509
 just 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.819
 even more what the profession and I know that I catch something very often say 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.270

 average gestation period therefore about a ban on sweets by one 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:49.540

 from coming uti have four holes all culture service except for example 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:16.869

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.809
 in the reactions and boys of course 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:19.919
