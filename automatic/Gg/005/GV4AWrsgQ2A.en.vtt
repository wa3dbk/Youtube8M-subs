from a dental hygiene perspective make

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
from a dental hygiene perspective make
sure<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.369> rinsing<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:48.030> teeth<00:01:48.210> often<00:01:48.420> but

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
sure you're rinsing your teeth often but

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
sure you're rinsing your teeth often but
that's<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.110> common<00:01:49.320> sense<00:01:49.439> dental<00:01:49.950> hygiene

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that's just common sense dental hygiene

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.870 
that's just common sense dental hygiene
of<00:01:50.430> any<00:01:50.549> food<00:01:50.899> but<00:01:51.899> dates<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.860> wonder<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
of any food but dates are a wonder how

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
of any food but dates are a wonder how
many<00:01:54.119> days<00:01:54.420> per<00:01:54.780> hour<00:01:55.219> consume<00:01:56.219> around<00:01:56.939> one

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
many days per hour consume around one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.469 
many days per hour consume around one
gram<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> carb<00:01:58.469> per<00:01:58.829> kilobyte<00:01:59.280> per<00:01:59.790> hour<00:01:59.939> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
gram of carb per kilobyte per hour so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.590 
gram of carb per kilobyte per hour so
for<00:02:00.719> me<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.439> around<00:02:01.740> 65<00:02:02.399> grams<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.030> carbs

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
for me that's around 65 grams of carbs

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
for me that's around 65 grams of carbs
per<00:02:04.020> hour<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> 65<00:02:04.890> kilos<00:02:05.219> aprox

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
per hour and 65 kilos aprox

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.710 
per hour and 65 kilos aprox
so<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.399> 100<00:02:08.399> grams<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.910> dates<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so that's about 100 grams of dates so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440 
so that's about 100 grams of dates so
it's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.140> basic<00:02:10.470> math<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.270> some

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's a really basic math so do some

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.050 
it's a really basic math so do some
little<00:02:12.569> bit<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.840> base

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
little bit of base

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.660 
little bit of base
