production company and legend and we

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.790 
production company and legend and we
decided<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.180> we<00:00:49.390> wanted<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.870> obviously

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
decided that we wanted to obviously

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.680 
decided that we wanted to obviously
because<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.430> song<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.700> called<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:52.210> Josie<00:00:52.570> we

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
because the song is called on Josie we

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.660 
because the song is called on Josie we
wanted<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:52.989> capture<00:00:53.320> joburg<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.550> know

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
wanted to capture joburg and you know

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.450 
wanted to capture joburg and you know
its<00:00:54.879> various<00:00:55.239> elements<00:00:55.570> but<00:00:55.950> caption<00:00:56.950> in<00:00:57.160> a

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
its various elements but caption in a

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.280 
its various elements but caption in a
way<00:00:57.610> that<00:00:57.910> hadn't<00:00:58.390> necessarily<00:00:58.510> been<00:00:59.050> done

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
way that hadn't necessarily been done

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.400 
way that hadn't necessarily been done
before<00:01:00.150> so<00:01:01.150> we<00:01:01.180> decided<00:01:01.690> right<00:01:02.080> from<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
before so we decided right from the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.900 
before so we decided right from the
concept<00:01:02.830> that<00:01:02.890> it<00:01:03.070> would<00:01:03.220> be<00:01:03.340> in<00:01:03.489> black<00:01:03.730> and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
concept that it would be in black and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.770 
concept that it would be in black and
white<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.800> personally<00:01:05.800> thought<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.310> because

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
white I personally thought that because

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.749 
white I personally thought that because
every<00:01:07.780> artist<00:01:08.140> has<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.410> do<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> classic<00:01:09.009> like<00:01:09.700> a

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
every artist has to do a classic like a

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.260 
every artist has to do a classic like a
white<00:01:10.060> video<00:01:11.220> hip-hop<00:01:12.220> artist<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:12.910> hadn't

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
white video hip-hop artist and I hadn't

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.330 
white video hip-hop artist and I hadn't
really<00:01:13.509> done<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:14.140> know<00:01:14.259> so<00:01:15.160> I<00:01:15.220> thought

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
really done that you know so I thought

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.830 
really done that you know so I thought
it<00:01:15.430> was<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.580> great<00:01:15.729> time<00:01:15.970> for<00:01:16.180> me<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.390> do<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.570> black

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
it was a great time for me to do a black

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.990 
it was a great time for me to do a black
