this planet is to the first planet in
the<00:01:28.650> game<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> main<00:01:29.850> difference<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the game but the main difference here is

and jumping when you're ready you have

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.570 
and jumping when you're ready you have
to<00:02:42.420> wait<00:02:42.569> for<00:02:42.720> these<00:02:42.810> bomb<00:02:43.050> bubbles<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:44.010> slowly

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
to wait for these bomb bubbles to slowly

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.920 
to wait for these bomb bubbles to slowly
disappear<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.209> inhale<00:02:45.480> these<00:02:45.630> purple

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
things and shoot them back out at the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.070 
things and shoot them back out at the
center<00:02:47.220> boss<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:48.420> one's<00:02:48.600> probably<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:49.049> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
center boss that one's probably one of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.420 
center boss that one's probably one of
the<00:02:49.170> more<00:02:49.260> easier<00:02:49.620> ones<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.799> dodge<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.310> not

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the more easier ones to dodge but not

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the more easier ones to dodge but not
one<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> more<00:02:50.730> easier<00:02:51.030> ones<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.239> land

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
one of the more easier ones to land

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.000 
one of the more easier ones to land
because<00:02:51.569> you're<00:02:51.840> hitting<00:02:52.049> window<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.650> limited

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
because you're hitting window is limited

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
because you're hitting window is limited
now<00:02:53.489> fire<00:02:53.790> fire<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.600> probably<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> easiest

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
now fire fire is probably the easiest

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.809 
now fire fire is probably the easiest
form<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:55.980> okay<00:02:56.549> well<00:02:56.730> of

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
form of them all it's okay well of

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.130 
form of them all it's okay well of
course<00:02:56.880> right<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> say<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> get<00:02:57.959> hurt

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
course right when I say that I get hurt

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.570 
course right when I say that I get hurt
but<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.530> pretty<00:02:58.680> easy<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> land<00:02:59.220> hits<00:02:59.430> on

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
but it is pretty easy to land hits on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.460 
but it is pretty easy to land hits on
him<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.880> pretty<00:03:00.090> easy<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.360> dodge<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.290> hits

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
him it is pretty easy to dodge the hits

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.860 
him it is pretty easy to dodge the hits
so<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.519> forth<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.000> electric<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.690> is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
so on so forth this is electric this is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.240 
so on so forth this is electric this is
probably<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> hardest<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:04.769> because<00:03:04.799> these

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
probably the hardest one because these

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.890 
probably the hardest one because these
electric<00:03:05.700> attacks<00:03:05.940> actually<00:03:06.090> homed<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.540> on

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
electric attacks actually homed in on

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.059 
electric attacks actually homed in on
you<00:03:07.080> at<00:03:07.260> least<00:03:07.380> when<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.560> first<00:03:07.769> shoot<00:03:07.950> out

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you at least when they first shoot out

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.140 
you at least when they first shoot out
then<00:03:08.250> they<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.459> bounce<00:03:08.640> all<00:03:08.760> over<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.000> place

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
then they just bounce all over the place

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.610 
then they just bounce all over the place
and<00:03:09.420> eventually<00:03:10.200> they'll<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:10.500> become

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and eventually they'll just become

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.960 
and eventually they'll just become
little<00:03:10.920> sports<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.459> inhale<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
little sports that you can inhale and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.000 
little sports that you can inhale and
shoot<00:03:12.120> back<00:03:12.269> at<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> boss<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.920> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
shoot back at the boss but that is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.650 
shoot back at the boss but that is
definitely<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.430> trickiest<00:03:14.819> form<00:03:15.150> alright

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
definitely the trickiest form alright

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.599 
definitely the trickiest form alright
fire<00:03:15.959> again<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:16.769> go<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> probably<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
fire again now go into the probably the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.729 
fire again now go into the probably the
easiest<00:03:18.000> form<00:03:18.329> right<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.019> go<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.560> always

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
easiest form right here we go it always

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.920 
easiest form right here we go it always
attacks<00:03:20.100> twice<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.880> saw<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.329> explosion

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
attacks twice but you saw that explosion

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.180 
attacks twice but you saw that explosion
that<00:03:22.079> means<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.440> boss<00:03:22.620> form<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:22.980> done

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that means that the boss form is done

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.920 
that means that the boss form is done
and<00:03:23.370> I've<00:03:23.459> probably<00:03:23.730> defeated<00:03:24.359> many<00:03:24.480> forms

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and I've probably defeated many forms

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.910 
and I've probably defeated many forms
already<00:03:25.079> but<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.500> wanted<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.739> explain

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
already but I just wanted to explain

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.410 
already but I just wanted to explain
that<00:03:26.100> winning<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.519> explosion<00:03:26.820> that

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
that winning to that explosion that

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.970 
that winning to that explosion that
means<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.900> form<00:03:28.230> will<00:03:28.410> never<00:03:28.650> show<00:03:28.950> up

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
means that that form will never show up

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.520 
means that that form will never show up
again<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.239> ice<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.690> done<00:03:30.870> what<00:03:31.410> else

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
again there we go ice is done what else

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.160 
again there we go ice is done what else
is<00:03:31.709> there<00:03:31.859> all<00:03:32.700> right<00:03:32.880> spike<00:03:33.239> here<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:33.840> go<00:03:33.959> I

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
is there all right spike here we go I

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.840 
is there all right spike here we go I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
had you can usually land two hits on
