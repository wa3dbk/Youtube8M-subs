the way to the right mixture here you

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.740 
the way to the right mixture here you
heel<00:00:53.770> is<00:00:54.250> on<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> floor<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.030> take<00:00:55.180> a<00:00:55.210> step<00:00:55.329> come

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
heel is on the floor so take a step come

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.910 
heel is on the floor so take a step come
down<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.789> kick<00:00:57.789> extend<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.510> arm<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.739> side

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
down and kick extend the arm to the side

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.829

do<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.820> same<00:01:01.059> thing<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.420> other<00:01:01.449> side<00:01:02.699> kick

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
do the same thing on the other side kick

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.389

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
so the way should be completely shifted

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.499 
so the way should be completely shifted
which<00:01:06.580> means<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.180> side<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.479> should
