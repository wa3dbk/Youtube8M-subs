00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
would definitely buy this if it was a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.949 
would definitely buy this if it was a
30-dollar<00:02:57.830> application<00:02:58.550> or<00:02:58.670> more<00:02:58.880> i<00:02:59.090> think

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
30-dollar application or more i think

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.890 
30-dollar application or more i think
for<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.470> dollar<00:03:00.740> this<00:03:01.130> is<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.640> cheap<00:03:01.940> it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
for a dollar this is really cheap it

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.400 
for a dollar this is really cheap it
can't<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:03.260> any<00:03:03.320> cheaper<00:03:03.650> than<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:05.290> okay<00:03:06.290> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
can't get any cheaper than this okay and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.510 
can't get any cheaper than this okay and
another<00:03:06.530> main<00:03:06.950> thing<00:03:07.190> about<00:03:07.370> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
another main thing about this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.900 
another main thing about this
application<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.270> perks<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.890> it's<00:03:10.550> sort<00:03:10.760> of

you get unlimited ammo and just crazy

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.020 
you get unlimited ammo and just crazy
number<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.709> monsters<00:04:16.949> coming<00:04:17.459> at<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.940> you

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
number of monsters coming at you and you

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.750 
number of monsters coming at you and you
just<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.449> kill<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:18.930> all<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.519> really

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
just have to kill them all it's a really

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.469 
just have to kill them all it's a really
fun<00:04:21.590> mode<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.919> think<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.520> my<00:04:23.760> favorite<00:04:24.270> part

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
fun mode I think it's my favorite part

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.570 
fun mode I think it's my favorite part
of<00:04:24.540> this<00:04:24.630> app<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:27.620> i'm<00:04:28.620> going<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.860> i<00:04:29.100> just<00:04:29.220> died

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
of this app and i'm going to i just died

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.610 
of this app and i'm going to i just died
so<00:04:29.880> quickly<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:30.510> not<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:30.990> easy<00:04:31.139> as<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.440> think

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
so quickly it's not as easy as you think

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.439 
so quickly it's not as easy as you think
it's<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.340> circles<00:04:32.449> it's

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
it's just going in circles it's

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.140 
it's just going in circles it's
definitely<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.800> takes<00:04:35.220> some<00:04:35.400> strategy<00:04:36.000> you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
definitely it takes some strategy you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.820 
definitely it takes some strategy you
have<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.419> make<00:04:36.570> path<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.320> can<00:04:37.590> walk

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
have to make path so you can walk

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.310 
have to make path so you can walk
through<00:04:38.130> them<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.570> see<00:04:39.570> I'm<00:04:39.690> already<00:04:39.810> halfway

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
through them and see I'm already halfway

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.550 
through them and see I'm already halfway
done<00:04:40.680> with<00:04:40.740> my<00:04:40.979> health<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.669> crazy<00:04:42.060> and

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
done with my health it's just crazy and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.290 
done with my health it's just crazy and
it's<00:04:43.560> mainly<00:04:44.070> because<00:04:44.340> I'm<00:04:44.610> filming<00:04:45.060> while

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
it's mainly because I'm filming while

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.000 
it's mainly because I'm filming while
I'm<00:04:45.449> talking<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.110> looking<00:04:46.710> through<00:04:46.889> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
I'm talking and looking through the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.760 
I'm talking and looking through the
camera<00:04:47.039> but<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.449> really<00:04:48.690> it's<00:04:49.139> not<00:04:49.560> that

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
camera but it is really it's not that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.400 
camera but it is really it's not that
easy<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.539> only<00:04:51.630> weapon<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.199> get

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
easy and this is the only weapon you get

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.900 
easy and this is the only weapon you get
so<00:04:54.289> that's<00:04:55.289> it<00:04:55.590> I'm<00:04:56.039> gonna<00:04:56.160> die<00:04:56.400> right<00:04:56.760> now

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
so that's it I'm gonna die right now

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.589 
so that's it I'm gonna die right now
probably<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:58.020> yeah<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.800> died<00:04:59.150> so<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.300> tells<00:05:00.450> me

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599
