tell that anything is impossible so when

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.469

brother<00:02:52.590> what<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:54.130> technology<00:02:54.819> that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
brother what is this technology that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.360 
brother what is this technology that
you're<00:02:55.150> using<00:02:55.329> from<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.049> desktop<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.160> car

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
you're using from the desktop to the car

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.160 
you're using from the desktop to the car
so<00:02:58.120> basically<00:02:58.450> what<00:02:58.630> we're<00:02:58.750> looking<00:02:59.019> at<00:02:59.109> here

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
so basically what we're looking at here

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.789 
so basically what we're looking at here
is<00:02:59.769> that<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.730> GPS<00:03:01.180> tracking<00:03:01.510> system

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
is that this is a GPS tracking system

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.550 
is that this is a GPS tracking system
that's<00:03:02.799> integrated<00:03:03.700> into<00:03:03.940> our<00:03:04.000> dash<00:03:04.209> top

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
that's integrated into our dash top

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.900 
that's integrated into our dash top
accessing<00:03:05.560> any<00:03:05.769> information<00:03:06.430> from<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.730> dash

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
accessing any information from the dash

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.789 
accessing any information from the dash
top<00:03:07.180> system<00:03:07.630> can<00:03:07.900> also<00:03:08.079> be<00:03:08.319> done<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.680> your

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
top system can also be done on your

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.039 
top system can also be done on your
mobile<00:03:09.160> device<00:03:09.190> through<00:03:09.910> email<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.810> really

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
mobile device through email it's really

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.720
