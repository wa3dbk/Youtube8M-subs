course of this series we will break your

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.110 
course of this series we will break your
electrical<00:00:41.110> system<00:00:41.140> down<00:00:41.710> into<00:00:42.250> four<00:00:42.550> million

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
electrical system down into four million

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.869 
electrical system down into four million
categories<00:00:43.750> we<00:00:44.739> start<00:00:45.100> with<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.370> alternator

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
categories we start with the alternator

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.780 
categories we start with the alternator
then<00:00:46.750> we'll<00:00:46.989> go<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.620> battery<00:00:48.040> size<00:00:48.339> and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
then we'll go to the battery size and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.810 
then we'll go to the battery size and
types<00:00:49.290> then<00:00:50.290> we<00:00:50.440> go<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.650> how<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.070> charge<00:00:51.520> them

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
types then we go to how to charge them

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.810 
types then we go to how to charge them
effectively<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.110> finally<00:00:53.770> we<00:00:53.890> will<00:00:54.129> show<00:00:54.370> how

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
effectively and finally we will show how

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.630 
effectively and finally we will show how
to<00:00:54.879> effectively<00:00:55.719> use<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.739> power<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.190> have

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
to effectively use this power you have

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.020 
to effectively use this power you have
to<00:00:58.030> satisfy<00:00:58.629> your<00:00:59.289> needs<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.770> board<00:01:00.039> there's<00:01:00.969> a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
to satisfy your needs on board there's a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.400 
to satisfy your needs on board there's a
common<00:01:01.329> myth<00:01:01.539> that<00:01:01.570> just<00:01:02.020> because<00:01:02.260> you<00:01:02.379> have

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
common myth that just because you have

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.200 
common myth that just because you have
large<00:01:02.800> alternators<00:01:03.520> you<00:01:03.670> can<00:01:03.820> charge<00:01:04.030> your

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
large alternators you can charge your

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.719 
large alternators you can charge your
batteries<00:01:04.570> faster<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.490> show<00:01:06.670> you

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
batteries faster I'm here to show you

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.700 
batteries faster I'm here to show you
that<00:01:06.910> that<00:01:07.240> may<00:01:07.570> not<00:01:07.600> necessarily<00:01:08.050> be<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
that that may not necessarily be the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.830 
that that may not necessarily be the
case<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.759> an<00:01:09.940> alternator<00:01:10.149> testbench

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
case this is an alternator testbench

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.050 
case this is an alternator testbench
used<00:01:11.289> for<00:01:11.560> obviously<00:01:12.039> testing<00:01:12.520> alternators

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
used for obviously testing alternators

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.270 
used for obviously testing alternators
on<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.960> test<00:01:14.170> bench<00:01:14.350> at<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.619> moment<00:01:14.950> we<00:01:15.070> have

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
on the test bench at the moment we have

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.990 
on the test bench at the moment we have
a<00:01:15.640> 90<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.240> Bosch<00:01:16.840> alternator<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.880> we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
a 90 on Bosch alternator and here we

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200 
a 90 on Bosch alternator and here we
have<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.149> 200<00:01:19.960> amp<00:01:20.080> alternator<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.190> as<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.030> can

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
have a 200 amp alternator and as you can

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.300 
have a 200 amp alternator and as you can
see<00:01:22.450> these<00:01:23.229> two<00:01:23.440> alternators<00:01:23.890> are<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.130> same

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
see these two alternators are the same

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.570 
see these two alternators are the same
size<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:25.709> obviously<00:01:26.709> the<00:01:26.830> question<00:01:27.009> is<00:01:27.340> well

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
size but obviously the question is well

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.969 
size but obviously the question is well
why<00:01:27.789> is<00:01:27.849> this<00:01:28.149> one<00:01:28.360> only<00:01:28.539> producing<00:01:29.200> 90<00:01:29.560> amps

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
why is this one only producing 90 amps

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.270 
why is this one only producing 90 amps
while<00:01:30.550> this<00:01:30.729> one<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.090> producing<00:01:31.509> 200<00:01:32.200> amps<00:01:32.440> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
while this one is producing 200 amps and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.389 
while this one is producing 200 amps and
the<00:01:33.789> secret<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.539> in<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.440> revolutions<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.220> the

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
the secret is in the revolutions of the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.389 
the secret is in the revolutions of the
alternator<00:01:37.410> although<00:01:38.410> they<00:01:38.590> are<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.190> same

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
alternator although they are the same

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.330 
alternator although they are the same
size<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.780> unit<00:01:41.170> here<00:01:41.410> will<00:01:41.649> produce<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
size this unit here will produce the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.749 
size this unit here will produce the
power<00:01:42.550> at<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.910> low<00:01:43.270> rpm<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.979> unit<00:01:45.310> here<00:01:45.490> will

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
power at a low rpm this unit here will

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.809 
power at a low rpm this unit here will
produce<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.240> power<00:01:46.420> at<00:01:46.959> a<00:01:47.020> high<00:01:47.229> rpm<00:01:47.819> for

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
produce the power at a high rpm for

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.609 
produce the power at a high rpm for
example<00:01:49.270> if<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.509> are<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.690> police<00:01:50.080> car<00:01:50.349> and

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
example if you are a police car and

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.040 
example if you are a police car and
you're<00:01:51.580> at<00:01:51.700> low<00:01:51.970> rpm<00:01:52.479> with<00:01:52.690> your<00:01:52.840> lights

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
you're at low rpm with your lights

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.419 
you're at low rpm with your lights
working<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.590> would<00:01:53.709> want<00:01:53.920> an<00:01:54.039> alternator

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
working you would want an alternator

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.180 
working you would want an alternator
like<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:54.849> if<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.020> are<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.229> racing<00:01:56.679> car<00:01:56.920> and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
like this if you are a racing car and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.550 
like this if you are a racing car and
your<00:01:58.060> engines<00:01:58.420> running<00:01:58.630> at<00:01:58.810> high<00:01:58.989> speed<00:01:59.380> all

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
your engines running at high speed all

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.830 
your engines running at high speed all
the<00:01:59.590> time<00:01:59.709> and<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:00.729> want<00:02:00.849> extra<00:02:01.119> power<00:02:01.479> you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the time and you want extra power you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.050 
the time and you want extra power you
would<00:02:02.380> want<00:02:02.590> an<00:02:02.800> alternator<00:02:03.069> like<00:02:03.580> this

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
would want an alternator like this

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.219 
would want an alternator like this
each<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:05.050> these<00:02:05.170> alternators<00:02:05.770> has<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> graph

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
each of these alternators has a graph

each of these alternators has a graph
attached<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.679> called<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.069> par<00:02:09.369> curve<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
attached with it called a par curve this

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.720 
attached with it called a par curve this
shows<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.680> amount<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.010> amps<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.610> the

now<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.250> huge<00:02:18.670> mistake<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.480> when<00:02:19.780> people<00:02:20.200> take

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
now the huge mistake is when people take

simply<00:06:41.730> by<00:06:41.880> increasing<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.510> engine<00:06:42.780> rpm

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
simply by increasing the engine rpm

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:54.670 
simply by increasing the engine rpm
we're<00:06:45.000> now<00:06:45.120> off<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.330> 60<00:06:45.810> amps<00:06:51.110> 7180<00:06:52.110> amps

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.280 

90<00:06:55.680> amps

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.550 

ninety-eight<00:06:59.130> amps

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.500 

103<00:07:04.740> 106

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.270 

112

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.210 

112<00:07:16.330> so<00:07:17.330> you<00:07:17.389> can<00:07:17.840> increase<00:07:18.259> your<00:07:18.379> engine<00:07:18.650> rpm

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
112 so you can increase your engine rpm

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.730 
112 so you can increase your engine rpm
and<00:07:19.550> plot<00:07:20.210> the<00:07:20.389> currents<00:07:20.810> hopefully<00:07:21.500> you<00:07:21.650> will

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
and plot the currents hopefully you will

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.580 
and plot the currents hopefully you will
find<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:22.610> at<00:07:22.759> your<00:07:22.909> cruising<00:07:23.389> speed<00:07:23.659> you

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
find that at your cruising speed you

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.930 
find that at your cruising speed you
will<00:07:24.740> have<00:07:24.919> maximized<00:07:25.520> your<00:07:25.550> rpm<00:07:26.330> performance
