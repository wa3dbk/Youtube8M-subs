00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.910
 the publisher the somb 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.810
 for this time a functioning song called 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 because as of morning 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.759
 so we'll start a cell that we talk about too much - troops it's a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.759
 teenager 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 no 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 the socialists abstained 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.770
 he will have movements back and forth on social on this theme 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.730
 especially so I'm going to say it 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.780
 e I specify 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.580
 and that's the return 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.810
 so we'll start second in the fourth quarter you talk to all of you 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.380
 packed up 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.160
 we will make a second body in the second 15 to the third string 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.730
 the return 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 the purses this same door well the third rope abidjan 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 we will be back 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 the goal being that whoever said we hear it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.480
 after second part of too many second places 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.480
 second corner a round trip 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.650
 then fourth quarter the Swiss second corner 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.530
 then five kamikazes always this second corner 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.010
 so that makes 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.350
 harper still second guardhouse 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.540
 this time m a round trip 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.550
 always on this second string in the fourth quarter 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.930
 and then finally fifth case 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 so on that bitter part 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.480
 after the third guardhouse 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.790
 we were still fourth quarter 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.690
 round trip 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.790
 then japan will go back on the the atrium place 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.799
 abbas 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.979

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.639
 fourth quarter 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 in all this in slow motion 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 no 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.259
 therefore not have been able to start again in the country 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.259
 you are the point to file a similar file 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.399

 at the same time 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.759

 without much clutter as to a return to the box ps6 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.279

 just after this third millennium 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.489
 the guitar and the holy land before 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.479

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.909

 there are other game publishers during that time just that 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.840
