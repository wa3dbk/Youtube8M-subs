easier to do when they are first born

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.160 
easier to do when they are first born
and<00:02:37.280> really<00:02:37.549> little<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.120> rabbit<00:02:38.810> should<00:02:38.989> be

and really little a rabbit should be

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.319 
and really little a rabbit should be
about<00:02:39.500> six<00:02:39.920> months<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.519> year<00:02:40.760> old<00:02:41.060> before

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
about six months to a year old before

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.780 
about six months to a year old before
they'll<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.290> attention<00:02:42.739> span<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.190> learn

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
they'll have the attention span to learn

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.500 
they'll have the attention span to learn
something<00:02:44.299> like<00:02:44.480> being<00:02:44.780> potty<00:02:45.019> trained<00:02:48.370> also

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
something like being potty trained also

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.630 
something like being potty trained also
the<00:02:50.510> more<00:02:51.019> they<00:02:51.200> get<00:02:51.380> potty<00:02:51.950> trained<00:02:52.340> you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
the more they get potty trained you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.150 
the more they get potty trained you
should<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:54.350> more<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.709> let<00:02:54.859> them<00:02:54.950> run

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
should the more you can let them run

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.129 
should the more you can let them run
around<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.519> house<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.510> go<00:02:56.690> into<00:02:56.989> new

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
around the house more and go into new

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.520 
around the house more and go into new
areas<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.359> have<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.870> get<00:03:00.019> more<00:03:00.260> litter

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
areas and so you have to get more litter

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.949 
areas and so you have to get more litter
boxes<00:03:00.950> because<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:02.389> know<00:03:02.569> they're<00:03:02.750> if

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
boxes because you know they're if

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.229

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.699 
they're in a room way across the house
they're<00:03:05.569> probably<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.989> going<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.260> run<00:03:06.500> back

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
they're probably not going to run back

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.229 
they're probably not going to run back
to<00:03:06.889> their<00:03:07.040> litter<00:03:07.310> box<00:03:07.519> if<00:03:07.730> they<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.120> use
