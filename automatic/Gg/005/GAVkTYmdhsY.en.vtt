strap basically all this together with a
new<00:00:51.829> blank<00:00:52.280> construction<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.510> new<00:00:53.660> blade

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
new blank construction this new blade

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.060 
new blank construction this new blade
construction<00:00:54.050> we're<00:00:54.410> calling<00:00:54.649> high<00:00:54.800> power

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
construction we're calling high power

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.800 
construction we're calling high power
racks<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.790> taking<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.239> high<00:00:56.390> modulus

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
racks and this is taking a high modulus

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.220 
racks and this is taking a high modulus
graphite<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.560> we're<00:00:58.399> taking<00:00:58.930> carbon<00:00:59.930> tape

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
graphite and we're taking carbon tape

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.110 
graphite and we're taking carbon tape
and<00:01:00.440> we're<00:01:00.950> weaving<00:01:01.280> this<00:01:01.370> carbon<00:01:01.760> tape<00:01:01.910> up

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and we're weaving this carbon tape up

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.439 
and we're weaving this carbon tape up
the<00:01:02.420> blank<00:01:02.720> at<00:01:03.470> 45-degree<00:01:04.220> angles<00:01:04.579> basically

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the blank at 45-degree angles basically

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.059 
the blank at 45-degree angles basically
at<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.719> same<00:01:05.899> time<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.409> when<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.649> rolls<00:01:06.829> up<00:01:06.950> the

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:07.069 
at the same time so when it rolls up the

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.919 
at the same time so when it rolls up the
blanket<00:01:07.399> kind<00:01:07.579> of<00:01:07.670> forms<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.539> know<00:01:08.689> like<00:01:08.810> an

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
blanket kind of forms a you know like an

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:12.039 
blanket kind of forms a you know like an
X<00:01:09.139> pattern<00:01:09.439> up<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.189> blank<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.359> what<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:11.810> X

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
X pattern up to blank so what this X

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.050 
X pattern up to blank so what this X
pattern<00:01:12.409> does<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:13.159> when<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.609> rods<00:01:13.789> under

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
pattern does is when the rods under

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.679 
pattern does is when the rods under
compression

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
compression

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.679 
compression
it<00:01:15.109> keeps<00:01:15.319> the<00:01:15.469> rod<00:01:15.649> from<00:01:15.799> buckling<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:16.639> a<00:01:17.240> rod

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
it keeps the rod from buckling so a rod

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.889 
it keeps the rod from buckling so a rod
is<00:01:18.380> circular<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.310> as<00:01:19.639> rod<00:01:19.939> bends<00:01:20.389> it<00:01:20.539> ovals

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
is circular and as rod bends it ovals

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.779 
is circular and as rod bends it ovals
out<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.499> then<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.039> gets<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> point<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.670> where

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
out and then it gets to a point to where

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.779 
out and then it gets to a point to where
it<00:01:22.880> breaks<00:01:23.179> so<00:01:23.619> take<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.649> straw<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:25.490> know<00:01:25.579> and

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
it breaks so take a straw you know and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.609 
it breaks so take a straw you know and
bend<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.299> straw<00:01:26.569> on<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.840> straw<00:01:27.079> you'll<00:01:27.350> see<00:01:27.530> it

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
bend a straw on the straw you'll see it

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.899 
bend a straw on the straw you'll see it
kind<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.920> oval<00:01:28.189> eyes<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:28.670> all<00:01:28.789> of<00:01:28.819> a

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
kind of oval eyes and then all of a

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.519 
kind of oval eyes and then all of a
sudden<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.179> buckles<00:01:29.539> out<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.959> breaks<00:01:30.229> so

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:30.529 
sudden it buckles out and it breaks so

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.230 
sudden it buckles out and it breaks so
we<00:01:31.100> want<00:01:31.279> to<00:01:31.369> make<00:01:31.490> sure<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.789> have<00:01:31.969> something

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
we want to make sure we have something

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.239 
we want to make sure we have something
in<00:01:32.450> there<00:01:32.569> to<00:01:32.659> keep<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.139> you<00:01:33.319> know<00:01:33.590> as<00:01:33.859> round<00:01:34.100> as

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
in there to keep it you know as round as

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.279 
in there to keep it you know as round as
possible<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.299> without<00:01:35.389> adding<00:01:35.959> a<00:01:36.049> ton<00:01:36.259> of

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
possible but without adding a ton of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.230 
possible but without adding a ton of
carbon<00:01:36.679> because<00:01:37.069> if<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.279> add<00:01:37.399> more<00:01:37.639> carbon<00:01:38.090> to

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
carbon because if you add more carbon to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.239 
carbon because if you add more carbon to
it<00:01:38.359> you're<00:01:38.749> just<00:01:38.869> going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.049> add<00:01:39.170> more<00:01:39.380> away<00:01:39.619> so

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
it you're just going to add more away so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:41.410 
it you're just going to add more away so
we<00:01:40.310> want<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.520> make<00:01:40.639> sure<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.850> rod<00:01:41.029> is<00:01:41.149> super

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
we want to make sure the rod is super

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.599 
we want to make sure the rod is super
light<00:01:41.600> super<00:01:41.929> sensitive<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.770> has<00:01:43.279> all<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
light super sensitive and has all the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.129 
light super sensitive and has all the
compression<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.209> world<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:44.959> high

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.139 
compression in the world so this high

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:46.480 
compression in the world so this high
power<00:01:45.349> axe<00:01:45.679> is<00:01:45.859> going<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.069> give<00:01:46.249> you<00:01:46.340> that

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
power axe is going to give you that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.800 
power axe is going to give you that
compression<00:01:46.999> strength<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:49.119> byproduct<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.270> this

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
compression strength a byproduct of this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.870 
compression strength a byproduct of this
also<00:01:51.139> is<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.590> kind<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> torsional

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
also is the kind of the torsional

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.179 
also is the kind of the torsional
rigidity<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.810> rod<00:01:54.079> which<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.349> blank<00:01:54.799> twist

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
rigidity of the rod which is blank twist

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.179 
rigidity of the rod which is blank twist
so<00:01:55.819> you<00:01:56.539> can<00:01:57.049> imagine<00:01:57.229> if<00:01:57.560> you're<00:01:57.679> loading<00:01:58.099> up

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
so you can imagine if you're loading up

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.589 
so you can imagine if you're loading up
a<00:01:58.279> rod<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.549> you're<00:01:58.639> making<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.939> cast<00:01:59.209> if<00:01:59.479> you

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
a rod and you're making a cast if you

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.779 
a rod and you're making a cast if you
have<00:01:59.719> twists<00:02:00.289> you<00:02:00.979> never<00:02:01.189> really<00:02:01.429> know<00:02:01.579> where

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
have twists you never really know where

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.190 
have twists you never really know where
the<00:02:01.909> lure<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.179> going<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.359> go<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.749> projectory

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the lure is going to go the projectory

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.839 
the lure is going to go the projectory
is<00:02:03.289> going<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.499> be<00:02:03.590> off<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.099> then<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.609> recovery

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
is going to be off and then the recovery

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.760 
is going to be off and then the recovery
rate<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.359> going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.539> be<00:02:05.689> not<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:06.229> quick<00:02:06.560> so

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
rate it's going to be not as quick so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.589 
rate it's going to be not as quick so
the<00:02:06.859> quicker<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:07.279> rod<00:02:07.429> can<00:02:07.459> recover<00:02:07.999> the

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
the quicker the rod can recover the

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.029 
the quicker the rod can recover the
further<00:02:08.929> you're<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.349> cast<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:09.890> less

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
further you're going to cast so the less

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920 
further you're going to cast so the less
fatigue<00:02:10.399> you're<00:02:10.549> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> have<00:02:10.939> basically

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
fatigue you're going to have basically

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.390 
fatigue you're going to have basically

right<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.409> probably<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.040> number

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
right this is probably just the number

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.589 
right this is probably just the number
one<00:02:46.459> problem

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
one problem

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.690 
one problem
all-purpose<00:02:48.079> absolutely<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.280> then<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.549> have

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
all-purpose absolutely and then you have

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.200 
all-purpose absolutely and then you have
the<00:02:49.849> HDC<00:02:50.389> the<00:02:50.659> seven<00:02:50.900> point<00:02:51.139> two
