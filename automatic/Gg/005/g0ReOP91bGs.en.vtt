00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.420
 nice guys almost trash or falls like 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.670
 come back here with this video other than the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.430
 usually better I will make a video tutorial on 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 how to use at its best 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.619
 potential the cinema mode here we are 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.720
 here precisely on the screen of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.180
 cinema mode waiting to see 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.920
 epilogue a bit as they arrived 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.869
 so when you're here in a group 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.660
 low multiplayer you go up here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.520
 icon cinema click on yours 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 you are of course you have to select 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.280
 the movie here appears the latest 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 recent matches of what you have 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 done in these days but apparently 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 yes I go here but they also appear 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 also the first game so I would like 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.730
 maybe inform me if I type the mode 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.649
 cinema a certain to a certain limit of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.739
 games recorded or remain 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.320
 really all the games recorded on 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.850
 here on select movie mode 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 then what you have to do once 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.369
 selected the game I know if here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.380
 you have made a high score today is 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.290
 happened to make a good field with it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.610
 sniper this video for everyone too 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.150
 those who may wish to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.520
 make a montage on call of duty black 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 ops two is precisely I will teach you some 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 tricks to be able to do the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 then free-mode kinematics 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.460
 once the game is selected 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 obviously just click start at 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.890
 filmed but before you get there 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.130
 I will also explain these two options creates 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.310
 aeg live which is precisely allows you to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 obviously to review the movie vi 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 allows you to register the ten or 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.579
 fifteen seconds you may have done 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.790
 a kill just let's say the size 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.680
 here's what you need this type of ag live e 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.140
 then if I'm not mistaken there's also the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.560
 possibility of being able to load it onto a 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.230
 the site is then you can see it again in hd 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 always on the computer then maybe there 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.100
 let me know better why not yet 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.520
 I have no idea I'm not very informed about 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.930
 this is this video in cod mode 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.130
 custer 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.880
 we don't say I don't find anything different 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:33.010
 indeed precisely equal to the path mode 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.690
 movie I started before is found in the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.330
 south of different things then here we are 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.360
 just started the movie is now 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.610
 obviously I will explain you all the commands 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.459
 for all those who may have 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.790
 they are the first bases on black ops 2 and not 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.989
 have not yet known the mode 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 Cinema is what do I do then 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.420
 once you are here just see 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.030
 below 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.760
 this bar we come the bar and gods 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.930
 commands to remove it you don't have to do 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.459
 other than press l3 here we are here and here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.130
 while if you want it to appear 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.630
 you have to crush it I advise you 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.030
 that maybe if you have a card 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.530
 hd acquisition pvr I recommend 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.720
 obviously to remove it because 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 otherwise, be annoyed by whom 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.500
 watch a video so low only premer 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.489
 l3 then I'm not on mine now 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.410
 character 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.980
 so we have to go on mine 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:41.739
 character here you see just pressing 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.530
 r1 to go on or 1 to go to 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.079
 I keep away from direct addressing 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.870
 the towards your character 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.150
 here we are already dead 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.090
 here we are then we resume 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.370
 obviously before starting a 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.680
 gameplay you just need to select a 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.079
 address you precisely on your own 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 character otherwise will record you the 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.290
 gameplay of another then this step 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.370
 it's really very important to go 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.850
 ahead on the gameplay you just don't have to 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.670
 do nothing but press 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:22.130
 r2 look look so it speeds up 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.710
 while if you hold it down everything goes 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.110
 fast while you have to adjust 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.580
 just pressing re 2 floor we say in 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.940
 based on your speed 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.920
 you have to get used to it a bit here 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.500
 other options to go back you have to 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.240
 crush the party the left arrow 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.940
 and press l2 the exact opposite 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.250
 but in this case you will get enough 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.750
 quickly it will take you 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.530
 at the beginning of the gameplay other to say 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.320
 to be able to record your gameplay 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.910
 or rather cut it I don't know how much it is 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.050
 duration 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.270
 you have to do square here we are here yes 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.040
 will not start the registration 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.860
 only if you see on the command bar 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.690
 that the director key lights up 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.990
 red therefore means that from this 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.410
 moment is starting to record you 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.900
 you tell yourself 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:23.020
 well he recorded up to a certain point 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.380
 but then well you have to press squared is 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:32.330
 make is not automatic and saves clips 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:35.870
 here we are then you have to press start is 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.730
 that kind of let's say gameplay minutes 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.170
 that you recorded will save it in 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.500
 let's say let's call it so 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:49.190
 then you can review it quietly 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.620
 send the edited movie before clip 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.200
 maybe then sail quietly named 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.660
 here are the videos you see again 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.060
 Used slots are 0 out of 8 I do 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:04.300
 quietly save awaits the 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.300
 rescue of course to wait 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.470
 finished this note now I will do you 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.470
 see another option so much 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.650
 important when you start the gameplay is 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.100
 you want to save the game or crush 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.580
 the director mode from the moment 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.940
 you want to record the gameplay while 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.880
 if you want to register the whole game 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.210
 it is not enough just to go back 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.180
 on the movie selection just don't do 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.340
 other than saving it in the slot is not 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.950
 there was none and difficult indeed 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.180
 you don't even need this explanation 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.190
 then another very chance 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.440
 important that is precisely I wanted to 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.720
 make it present is what you press 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.120
 so there is the triangle 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.640
 third person but that does not matter 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.460
 much while always putting 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.520
 another time we have this triangle 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.650
 mode here we are with free mode e 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.040
 what will you say what you find different well 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.840
 above the character cmv three there was the la 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.950
 written in this case had to appear 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.300
 behind hd while in this black ops 2 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.310
 great improvement that there has been 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.900
 and the one just to have removed the 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.980
 written above the character then 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.170
 this means clip clips guys yes if 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.080
 maybe you happen to make movies with it 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.110
 sniper put yourself camouflaged here 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.900
 inside of objects or it does not go well 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.750
 it serves no purpose and when it moves 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.690
 the character now I show it 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:45.910
 better now the writing not 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:48.680
 will appear look here is this really 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.300
 a really very important phase of the 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.920
 cinema mode in fact that really is me 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.070
 liked 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.440
 ok i think i have listed you all 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.940
 the basic functionality features of 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.650
 cinema mode 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.050
 I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.870
 I hope of course call of duty black 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.670
 ops two is to your liking 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.380
