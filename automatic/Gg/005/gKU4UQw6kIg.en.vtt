00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.909
 such a small fool clearly 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.909
 something secretly a single shot 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.890
 good comes Las Vegas 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.670
 Of course that was not a goal, it was just a storage bag 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.929
 the SAF Gimme 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.970
 there are to these headphones 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.949
 in the pack of which he is in and how it's done 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.040
 Headphones yes and that is a cooperation of Sennheiser and Adidas the HD 220th 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.300
 Because of that, Aldi knows the blue and the classic 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.700
 But if things can do more than make a great bag and look good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.910
 it is believed that is still open 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.389
 there 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:51.310
 So the trunk is a first appearance in Paris 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.590
 SID as normal very nice, even at first sight 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.340
 But let's look at the detail in detail as you can see on both 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.799
 Ears or that Aldi the 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:01.670
 with the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.450
 yes very simple but always push Kull 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.610
 Sign for him not 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.820
 Here you will see a small sticker the Sennheiser 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 generally advises to the whole of plastic 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.510
 the present one has heard that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.800
 but the ear cups themselves are very well padded so they remained very nice 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.450
 comfortable murder 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.170
 Conclusion of the straps is very comfortably padded SZ it both in the neck as 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.409
 even on the head itself is really no pain 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.409
 to have the suitcase on the contrary you do not notice him at all 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.700
 thanks you can see the cable here that is very thin 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.380
 and also in the blue kept the connections and both here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 headphone 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.420
 as well as later on the ball port or on the mp3 player 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.600
 are absolutely solid processed because when it was typical there was nothing to it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 at least so far 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.300
 So you can say processing and they are absolutely great 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.740
 No one buys a trunk roll looks good 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 To look at mummies 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.569
 as the Sun confirmed in office 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.309
 to be honest, you have to make a few compromises 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.380
 Of course, the sound is still better in Mayen than in my life 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.129
 this standard Apple headphone 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.389
 at virtually all others in Dierkow leading to date 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.769
 then something 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.199
 All the same, some details of Böhnlein disappeared too shrilly to Wesel too 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.129
 heat up woman 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.169
 All in all, the sound is nevertheless fine 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.219
 which is when he says it all done again in this suitcase are 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.699
 fix is ​​always emphasized and therefore the overall impression is always 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.699
 still positive 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.659
 So I come to my conclusion 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.109
 the racer says heinz-werner spoiled 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.249
 it will probably not be true 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.599
 but it lacks a bit less than the sound as it is not that 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.909
 best you experienced 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.459
 but and you have to admit it in any case that would be something in the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.539
 Packing club is so these tours have been 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.490
 is it really the hammer 3 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.939
 to sue the suitcases Caruso 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.369
 and by doing so they will be super functional age contract in your pocket 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.469
 then happened 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.899
 when he is sent 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.149
 Classes became 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.169
 a smallest pocket numbers 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.349
 if it really to lose 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.399
 generally can be said 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.849
 Design wise they are beyond any doubt this Ali's know-how 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 is simply iconic that is super adapt 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.040
 you can practically do it to a rather always tried so well not fixed 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.209
 the piece is tempted 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.919
 zuzulegen 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.509
 As I said my conclusion is very positive about this 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:51.359
 For headphones they are certainly not the best thing they sound for 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.249
 this price 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.819
 possibly pages can 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.809
 you are 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:59.279
 just the fanciest thing you can get for this price 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.039
 better 4 out of 5 make your decision if you want to get these suitcases
