off<00:02:20.250> form<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:21.270> someone<00:02:21.480> who<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.870> stays

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
off form is not someone who just stays

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
there and does nothing definitely not

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.620 
there and does nothing definitely not
he's<00:02:26.070> really<00:02:26.400> fast<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.850> well<00:02:27.000> even<00:02:27.180> though<00:02:27.420> on

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
he's really fast as well even though on

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.810 
he's really fast as well even though on
a<00:02:27.660> game<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.710> card<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.250> doesn't<00:02:29.490> show<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
a game of card it really doesn't show it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.020 
a game of card it really doesn't show it
but<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.510> actually<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:31.170> fast<00:02:31.640> which<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.670> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
but it's actually really fast which is I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
but it's actually really fast which is I
think<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.510> mostly<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> acceleration<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
think it's mostly the acceleration and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.440 
think it's mostly the acceleration and
it's<00:02:35.010> sprint<00:02:35.250> speed<00:02:35.490> it's<00:02:35.670> really<00:02:36.000> good<00:02:36.240> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it's sprint speed it's really good and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
it's sprint speed it's really good and
it's<00:02:36.960> dribbling<00:02:37.320> really<00:02:37.860> helps<00:02:38.160> eyes<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.490> can

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's dribbling really helps eyes you can

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.160 
it's dribbling really helps eyes you can
see<00:02:38.640> they're<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:38.970> booming<00:02:39.540> past<00:02:39.780> everyone<00:02:40.050> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
see they're just booming past everyone I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.200 
see they're just booming past everyone I
mean<00:02:40.350> that's<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:40.980> easy<00:02:41.160> 3<00:02:41.310> pace<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:42.120> its

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
mean that's not easy 3 pace but its

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.490 
mean that's not easy 3 pace but its
strength<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> bit<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.960> an<00:02:43.110> issue<00:02:43.230> because

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
strength is a bit of an issue because

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.540 
strength is a bit of an issue because
it's<00:02:44.220> got<00:02:44.460> around<00:02:44.670> 83<00:02:45.210> page<00:02:45.420> after<00:02:45.660> 90<00:02:46.500> days<00:02:46.680> 83

it's got around 83 page after 90 days 83
strength<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.200> best<00:02:49.320> thing<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
strength and it's not the best thing to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.060 
strength and it's not the best thing to
be<00:02:49.950> honest<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:51.090> these<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.530> got<00:02:52.740> three<00:02:52.920> star
