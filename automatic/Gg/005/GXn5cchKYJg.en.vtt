was at 44 Iron Guard on my hair as a

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.029 
was at 44 Iron Guard on my hair as a
heat<00:00:21.159> protectant<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.289> basically<00:00:23.650> i'm<00:00:23.859> going

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
heat protectant so basically i'm going

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.239 
heat protectant so basically i'm going
to<00:00:24.159> show<00:00:24.369> you<00:00:24.400> all<00:00:24.880> what<00:00:25.329> I<00:00:25.570> I<00:00:26.259> didn't<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.099> get

this<00:00:27.569> I<00:00:28.619> parted<00:00:29.619> my<00:00:29.769> hair<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:30.099> four<00:00:30.310> sections

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
this I parted my hair in four sections

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.700 
this I parted my hair in four sections
and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:32.320> use<00:00:32.590> these<00:00:32.920> Firefly<00:00:33.430> clips<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:35.500> better

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
and I use these Firefly clips we better

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.709 
and I use these Firefly clips we better
find<00:00:35.859> out<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.100> white<00:00:36.280> one<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:37.239> show<00:00:37.449> you<00:00:37.510> guys

find out of white one to show you guys
but<00:00:38.109> I<00:00:38.140> use<00:00:38.350> butterfly<00:00:38.829> clips<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:40.059> secure<00:00:40.899> the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
but I use butterfly clips to secure the

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.569 
but I use butterfly clips to secure the
sections<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:42.010> then<00:00:42.820> i<00:00:43.120> use<00:00:43.359> a<00:00:44.160> devin<00:00:45.160> that

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
sections and then i use a devin that

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.959 
sections and then i use a devin that
brush<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.390> i<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:49.890> wide<00:00:50.890> tooth<00:00:51.190> comb<00:00:51.250> that

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
brush and i have a wide tooth comb that

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.619 
brush and i have a wide tooth comb that
I<00:00:52.089> used<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.570> be<00:00:52.690> tangled<00:00:53.109> my<00:00:53.199> hair<00:00:53.620> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I used to be tangled my hair a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.750 
I used to be tangled my hair a
concentrator<00:00:55.629> nozzle<00:00:55.870> it's<00:00:56.800> very<00:00:57.600> thin<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
concentrator nozzle it's very thin it

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.890 
concentrator nozzle it's very thin it
allows<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:02.019> air<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:03.089> direct<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.269> one<00:01:04.510> place

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
allows the air to direct it one place

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.890 
allows the air to direct it one place
real<00:01:05.379> quickly<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:07.030> way<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.300> get<00:01:07.630> done

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
real quickly and that way you get done

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.110 
real quickly and that way you get done
faster<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.650> don't<00:01:11.830> end<00:01:12.010> up<00:01:12.220> causing<00:01:12.790> too

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
faster and you don't end up causing too

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.360 
faster and you don't end up causing too
much<00:01:13.240> damage<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.660> your<00:01:13.870> hair<00:01:14.080> because<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:15.160> air

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
much damage to your hair because the air

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.150 
much damage to your hair because the air
can<00:01:15.850> concentrate<00:01:16.480> on<00:01:16.600> one<00:01:16.780> section

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
can concentrate on one section

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.590 
can concentrate on one section
especially<00:01:18.160> since<00:01:18.370> it's<00:01:18.580> very<00:01:18.730> thin<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.090> then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
especially since it's very thin and then

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.590 
especially since it's very thin and then
just<00:01:20.560> one<00:01:20.800> blasted<00:01:21.370> it<00:01:21.520> pretty<00:01:21.910> much<00:01:22.150> not<00:01:22.360> one

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
just one blasted it pretty much not one

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.740 
just one blasted it pretty much not one
blast<00:01:22.840> but<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:23.800> anytime<00:01:24.040> today<00:01:24.370> with

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
blast but and that is anytime today with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.530 
blast but and that is anytime today with
normal<00:01:25.750> three<00:01:26.530> sections<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:28.180> going<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.450> be

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
normal three sections I'm going to be

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.700 
normal three sections I'm going to be
working<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.990> high<00:01:29.260> heat<00:01:30.570> well<00:01:31.570> huts<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.200> then

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
working on high heat well huts and then

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.100 
working on high heat well huts and then
high<00:01:33.010> pressure<00:01:33.040> as<00:01:33.940> well<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:35.200> using<00:01:35.410> an<00:01:35.620> ionic

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
is that uses the only bulge are at I use

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.090 
is that uses the only bulge are at I use
but<00:01:58.540> i'm<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:59.020> going<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.230> show<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.530> guys<00:01:59.590> how

but i'm just going to show you guys how
to<00:02:00.640> use<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.180> type<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.480> blow<00:02:01.720> dryer<00:02:01.960> because

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
to use this type of blow dryer because

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.830 
to use this type of blow dryer because
this<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.940> most<00:02:04.240> people<00:02:04.720> use<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this is the one that most people use so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.680 
this is the one that most people use so
basically<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.090> take<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> section

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
basically you're going to take a section

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:36.600 
basically you're going to take a section
and<00:02:11.940> painful<00:02:12.940> it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.990 

and<00:02:37.300> then<00:02:37.510> Brad<00:02:38.020> taken<00:02:39.420> even<00:02:40.420> dare<00:02:41.430> strike<00:02:42.430> one

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
and then Brad taken even dare strike one

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.950 
and then Brad taken even dare strike one
some<00:02:43.330> what<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.320> putting<00:02:44.830> more<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.730> each

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
some what I putting more on with each

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:59.850 
some what I putting more on with each
section<00:02:51.870> okay<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:58.570> just<00:02:59.080> section<00:02:59.680> this

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
section okay and then just section this

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:14.270 
section okay and then just section this
piece<00:03:00.160> off<00:03:00.660> again

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.370 

so<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.400> motion<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:15.910> want<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.450> use<00:03:16.720> basically

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
so the motion you want to use basically

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.150 
so the motion you want to use basically
is<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:18.520> use<00:03:18.700> your<00:03:18.880> brush<00:03:19.270> and<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.800> want<00:03:24.040> to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
is to use your brush and you want to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.220 
is to use your brush and you want to
either<00:03:24.370> be<00:03:24.670> underneath<00:03:26.220> or<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.020> side

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
either be underneath or like to the side

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.770 
either be underneath or like to the side
like<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:30.190> even<00:03:30.880> sometimes<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.540> this

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
like this or even sometimes like this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.440 
like this or even sometimes like this
with<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.110> brush<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:33.430> kind<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.910> want<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.210> try<00:03:34.390> to
