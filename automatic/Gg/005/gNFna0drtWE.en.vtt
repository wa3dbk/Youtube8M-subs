maybe<00:00:33.080> you<00:00:33.260> shouldn't<00:00:33.620> be<00:00:33.800> riding<00:00:33.980> I'm<00:00:34.370> not

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
maybe you shouldn't be riding I'm not

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.830 
maybe you shouldn't be riding I'm not
okay<00:00:35.270> you're<00:00:36.260> riding<00:00:36.739> we're<00:00:37.340> making<00:00:37.850> we

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
okay you're riding we're making we

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.869 
okay you're riding we're making we
immediately<00:00:39.290> spotted<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:40.010> neat<00:00:40.220> collection<00:00:40.489> of

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
immediately spotted a neat collection of

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.520 
immediately spotted a neat collection of
tech<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.510> we<00:00:41.570> could<00:00:41.720> use<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:41.930> modify<00:00:42.379> the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
tech that we could use to modify the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.320 
tech that we could use to modify the
bike<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:43.040> hopefully<00:00:43.489> give<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.730> enough<00:00:43.970> welly

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
bike and hopefully give it enough welly

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.270 
bike and hopefully give it enough welly
to<00:00:44.720> get<00:00:44.870> Otis<00:00:45.080> down<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.710> quarter<00:00:46.070> mile

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
to get Otis down the quarter mile

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.360 
to get Otis down the quarter mile
straight<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:48.410> want<00:00:48.590> something<00:00:48.830> that's<00:00:48.980> light

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
straight we want something that's light

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.310 
straight we want something that's light
and<00:00:49.670> super<00:00:49.910> fast<00:00:50.239> don't<00:00:50.540> wait<00:00:50.720> help<00:00:50.989> them<00:00:51.170> in

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
and super fast don't wait help them in

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.340 
and super fast don't wait help them in
yeah<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.460> spotted<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:53.030> nitro<00:00:53.540> powered<00:00:53.840> RC

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
yeah then I spotted a nitro powered RC

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.139 
yeah then I spotted a nitro powered RC
car<00:00:54.620> similar<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.460> one<00:00:55.579> we<00:00:55.700> previously

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
car similar to the one we previously

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.090 
car similar to the one we previously
used<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.750> win<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.930> world<00:00:57.170> record<00:00:57.620> well

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
used to win a world record well

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.190 
used to win a world record well
definitely<00:00:58.579> that's<00:00:58.790> super<00:00:59.210> fast<00:00:59.480> yeah<00:01:00.050> they

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
definitely that's super fast yeah they

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.479 
definitely that's super fast yeah they
only<00:01:00.230> issue<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.739> only<00:01:01.130> issue<00:01:01.280> with<00:01:01.309> night

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
only issue the only issue with night

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.100 
only issue the only issue with night
show<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.730> its<00:01:01.910> reliability<00:01:02.239> we've<00:01:02.809> only<00:01:02.930> got

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
show is its reliability we've only got

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.450 
show is its reliability we've only got
half<00:01:03.140> an<00:01:03.410> hour<00:01:03.530> as<00:01:03.739> well<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.040> set<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.369> up

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
half an hour as well to set it up

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.570 
half an hour as well to set it up
something<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:06.170> electric<00:01:07.100> ducted<00:01:07.250> fan

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
something like this electric ducted fan

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.609 
something like this electric ducted fan
engines<00:01:07.940> okay<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.300> yes<00:01:08.660> these<00:01:08.930> these<00:01:09.320> give<00:01:09.560> a

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
engines okay so yes these these give a

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.529 
engines okay so yes these these give a
huge<00:01:10.040> bang<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:10.610> your<00:01:10.670> buck<00:01:10.880> these<00:01:11.330> are

horsepower each and four of these that's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760 
horsepower each and four of these that's
more<00:01:22.039> power<00:01:22.280> than<00:01:22.550> an<00:01:22.610> original<00:01:22.820> Fiat<00:01:23.360> 500<00:01:23.929> on

a wheelie it'll really feel a bit scary
I<00:03:25.090> think<00:03:25.120> tomorrow<00:03:25.630> with<00:03:25.750> only<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.080> sub<00:03:26.320> crank

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
I think tomorrow with only a sub crank

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.320 
I think tomorrow with only a sub crank
it<00:03:26.830> right<00:03:26.980> up<00:03:27.100> yeah<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.640> take<00:03:27.850> your<00:03:27.970> time<00:03:28.180> but
