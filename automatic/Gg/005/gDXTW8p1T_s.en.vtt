you'll get a dropper and your call
reagent<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> stuff<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> tell<00:00:30.269> us

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
reagent we see the stuff that tell us

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
reagent we see the stuff that tell us
your<00:00:30.480> pH<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.470> you'll<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> vial<00:00:32.130> like

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
your pH and then you'll get a vial like

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.600 
your pH and then you'll get a vial like
this<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> test<00:00:35.460> your

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this so what you want to do is test your

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
this so what you want to do is test your
water<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.300> inside<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> chart<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
water and inside is also a chart that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
water and inside is also a chart that
gives<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.390> particular<00:00:39.930> pH<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
gives you this particular pH is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
gives you this particular pH is
according<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.340> color<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> water<00:00:42.030> comes

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
according to what color the water comes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
according to what color the water comes
out<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> test<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.610> here

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
out let's do a test so what I have here

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.750 
out let's do a test so what I have here
is<00:00:45.000> tap<00:00:45.270> water<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> upright<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> tap<00:00:46.950> for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
is tap water put it upright on a tap for

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
is tap water put it upright on a tap for
it<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.719> luck<00:00:49.289> Joe<00:00:49.530> maybe<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
it here you are in luck Joe maybe a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.299 
it here you are in luck Joe maybe a
little<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.610> net<00:00:50.850> probably<00:00:51.390> 3/4<00:00:51.930> away<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> now

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
little more net probably 3/4 away up now

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.049 
little more net probably 3/4 away up now
you<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.910> take<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> reagent<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:56.520> put<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> two

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you then take the reagent you put in two

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.689 
you then take the reagent you put in two
drops

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
drops

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
drops
one<00:00:59.699> two<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> need

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
one two all you need

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
one two all you need
don't<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:01.949> three<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.190> four<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.910> say<00:01:03.210> good

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
don't put three or four in to say good

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
don't put three or four in to say good
amount<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> gives<00:01:04.500> us<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> proper<00:01:05.070> reading

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
amount it gives us the proper reading

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.990 
amount it gives us the proper reading
snap<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> lid<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.630> give<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> shake<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.000> then

snap the lid on give it a shake and then

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.780 
snap the lid on give it a shake and then
take<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.750> water<00:01:09.990> match<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.520> your

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
take your water match it up to your

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
take your water match it up to your
particular<00:01:12.600> color<00:01:13.439> chart<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.010> I'm

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
particular color chart here and I'm

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
little more towards the acidic side and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.399 
little more towards the acidic side and
that's<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> pH<00:01:20.430> water<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> area<00:01:22.350> of
