now<00:00:08.309> right<00:00:08.610> then<00:00:08.880> what's<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.679> I'd<00:00:10.679> say

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
now right then what's going on I'd say

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.190 
now right then what's going on I'd say
here<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.580> walk<00:00:12.030> her<00:00:12.210> into<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.960> more

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
here and walk her into some more

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.970 
here and walk her into some more
quantity<00:00:13.799> go<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:14.309> multiplayer<00:00:14.730> gameplay<00:00:15.980> so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
quantity go some multiplayer gameplay so

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340 
quantity go some multiplayer gameplay so
right<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:18.090> playing<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.690> match<00:00:18.990> on

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
right now we are playing a match on

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080 
right now we are playing a match on
strike<00:00:19.830> zone<00:00:20.100> meaning<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.850> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
strike zone meaning that this is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.480 
strike zone meaning that this is
probably<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.689> pretty<00:00:21.900> short<00:00:22.109> video

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
probably going to be pretty short video

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.259 
probably going to be pretty short video
and<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.760> also<00:00:23.939> using<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.510> vector<00:00:25.199> CRB<00:00:25.500> again

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
and I'm also using the vector CRB again

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
and I'm also using the vector CRB again
we<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> red<00:00:27.750> dot<00:00:27.990> sights<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.650> also<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we have the red dot sights and also the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
we have the red dot sights and also the
foregrip<00:00:30.619> pretty<00:00:31.619> straightforward<00:00:32.189> setup

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
foregrip pretty straightforward setup

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.510 
foregrip pretty straightforward setup
probably<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> most<00:00:33.210> commonly<00:00:33.840> used<00:00:34.520> vector

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
probably the most commonly used vector

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
probably the most commonly used vector
setup<00:00:35.930> out<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> vector

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
setup out of this or like the vector

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.030 
setup out of this or like the vector
with<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> foregrip<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.090> silencer<00:00:40.010> Abad<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
with the foregrip and silencer Abad I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
with the foregrip and silencer Abad I
haven't<00:00:41.399> been<00:00:41.489> using<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.210> too<00:00:42.390> much

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
haven't been using this on so too much

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860 
haven't been using this on so too much
recently<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:44.090> don't<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> hasn't

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
recently I don't know like it hasn't

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
recently I don't know like it hasn't
really<00:00:46.200> affected<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.800> game<00:00:47.039> either<00:00:50.239> I've<00:00:51.239> been

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
really affected my game either I've been

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
really affected my game either I've been
like<00:00:51.510> strafing<00:00:51.899> away<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> whole<00:00:52.710> like

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
like strafing away from the whole like

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.310 
like strafing away from the whole like
stealth<00:00:53.460> feel<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.809> still<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
stealth feel and I still use that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
stealth feel and I still use that
silencer<00:00:56.129> loss<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.809> like

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
silencer loss but that's just like

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.729 
silencer loss but that's just like
necessary<00:00:59.180> when<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> move<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:00.539> Pet<00:01:01.469> Sounds

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
necessary when I move around Pet Sounds

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.119 
necessary when I move around Pet Sounds
is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> must<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.930> simple<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.320> s<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
is a must it's a simple as s but you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.899 
is a must it's a simple as s but you
don't<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.549> need<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.030> silencer<00:01:07.729> we're<00:01:08.729> not

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
don't really need a silencer we're not

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.440 
don't really need a silencer we're not
necessarily<00:01:11.450> one<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.840> come<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.170> oh

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
necessarily one over here come on oh

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.260 
necessarily one over here come on oh
yeah<00:01:15.479> shot<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:15.869> oh<00:01:16.850> that's<00:01:17.850> too<00:01:18.030> bad

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
yeah shot in the back oh that's too bad

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
yeah shot in the back oh that's too bad
I<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:19.110> hoping<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.860> kill<00:01:20.070> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
I was hoping I could get that kill as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.440 
I was hoping I could get that kill as
well<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.610> right<00:01:21.080> go<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.110> Riley

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
well all right go on Riley

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.330 
well all right go on Riley
boom<00:01:24.450> buddy<00:01:26.600> yeah<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> -<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.770> saw<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
boom buddy yeah so you - you saw me but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.080 
boom buddy yeah so you - you saw me but
I<00:01:29.430> saw<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> -<00:01:30.979> which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.369> saved<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.939> this

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I saw you - which is what saved me this

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.109 
I saw you - which is what saved me this
time<00:01:33.420> around

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
time around

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.210 
time around
yeah<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.570> following<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.110> let's<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.100> go

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
yeah it's not following me let's just go

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
yeah it's not following me let's just go
down<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.509> could<00:01:39.630> find<00:01:39.840> someone<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.259> here

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
down so we could find someone over here

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.700 
down so we could find someone over here
I<00:01:41.780> thought<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.020> would<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.170> spawning<00:01:43.470> over

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I thought they would be spawning over

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.870 
I thought they would be spawning over
here

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
here

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
here
doesn't<00:01:45.630> seem<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.930> anyone<00:01:46.200> though<00:01:46.380> no

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
doesn't seem to be anyone though no

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.880 
doesn't seem to be anyone though no
there's<00:01:46.829> floating<00:01:47.070> over<00:01:47.189> there<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:48.890> yeah

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
there's floating over there now yeah

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090 
there's floating over there now yeah
that<00:01:50.039> totally<00:01:50.189> makes<00:01:50.490> sense<00:01:51.320> not<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.439> all

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that totally makes sense not at all

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
that totally makes sense not at all
it's<00:01:53.399> cool<00:01:53.700> whatever<00:01:55.189> another<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.600> or<00:01:57.600> never

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's cool whatever another one or never

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.929 
it's cool whatever another one or never
guard<00:01:58.020> though<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.490> didn't<00:01:59.789> die

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
guard though all right you didn't die

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
guard though all right you didn't die
just<00:02:00.179> yet<00:02:02.090> insanity<00:02:03.860> now<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.039> wait<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
just yet insanity now let's wait for a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.580 
just yet insanity now let's wait for a
second<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:06.030> yeah<00:02:06.299> oh<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:07.200> gosh<00:02:07.350> there's
