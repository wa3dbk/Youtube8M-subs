a<00:03:42.430> watch<00:03:42.609> a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:04:02.640 

I<00:04:00.270> played<00:04:01.270> with<00:04:01.420> us<00:04:01.570> yesterday<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.290> made

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
I played with us yesterday and it made

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.570 
I played with us yesterday and it made
pretty<00:04:02.950> nice<00:04:03.190> fall<00:04:03.600> little<00:04:04.600> bit<00:04:04.720> slower<00:04:05.580> and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
pretty nice fall little bit slower and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.250 
pretty nice fall little bit slower and
somehow<00:04:06.940> thermal<00:04:07.570> blocks<00:04:07.780> are<00:04:07.930> typically

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
somehow thermal blocks are typically

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.820 
somehow thermal blocks are typically
slower<00:04:08.650> though<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:10.110> little<00:04:11.110> like<00:04:11.350> me<00:04:11.560> when<00:04:11.800> I

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
slower though a little like me when I

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:29.980 
slower though a little like me when I
get<00:04:11.980> up<00:04:12.070> in<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.280> morning

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.560 

get<00:04:30.620> some<00:04:30.740> nice<00:04:30.830> swirl<00:04:31.070> going<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:32.000> one<00:04:32.120> hole

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.110 

you<00:04:35.570> think<00:04:35.720> because<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.259> offset<00:04:36.729> yeah<00:04:37.729> they

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
you think because it is offset yeah they

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.790 
you think because it is offset yeah they
do<00:04:38.180> because<00:04:39.050> if<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.259> was<00:04:39.350> right<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.650> middle

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
do because if it was right in the middle

would<00:04:39.889> be<00:04:39.979> shooting<00:04:40.280> down<00:04:40.430> toward<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.789> bottom

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
would be shooting down toward the bottom

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.640 
would be shooting down toward the bottom
of<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.360> container<00:04:41.690> without<00:04:41.960> me<00:04:42.289> really

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
of the container without me really

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.550 
of the container without me really
tipping<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.250> yeah<00:04:43.930> that's<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.110> only<00:04:45.229> reason<00:04:45.500> I

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
tipping it yeah that's the only reason I

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:54.469

the<00:07:30.330> forefront<00:07:30.570> nice<00:07:31.229> little<00:07:31.530> machine<00:07:31.650> I

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
the forefront nice little machine I

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.730 
the forefront nice little machine I
think<00:07:31.979> yeah<00:07:32.909> I<00:07:33.240> like<00:07:33.569> toggle<00:07:34.199> switches<00:07:34.409> to

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
think yeah I like toggle switches to

their<00:07:35.240> mechanical<00:07:36.240> it's<00:07:36.990> not<00:07:37.259> around<00:07:37.830> no

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159 
their mechanical it's not around no

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.210 
their mechanical it's not around no
electronics<00:07:38.849> there<00:07:39.349> and<00:07:40.349> I<00:07:40.500> think<00:07:40.740> the<00:07:41.070> fit

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
electronics there and I think the fit

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.710 
electronics there and I think the fit
and<00:07:41.340> finish<00:07:41.430> is<00:07:41.580> really<00:07:41.729> good<00:07:42.150> yeah<00:07:42.449> I<00:07:42.630> think
