now<00:03:44.980> basically<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:47.230> really<00:03:47.799> like<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.480> but

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
now basically and I really like that but

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.920 
now basically and I really like that but
I<00:03:50.400> honestly<00:03:51.400> think<00:03:51.700> he'll<00:03:52.030> have<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.269> few<00:03:52.660> roles

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
I honestly think he'll have a few roles

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.900 
I honestly think he'll have a few roles
not<00:03:53.410> big<00:03:53.650> ones<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:54.010> course<00:03:54.040> because<00:03:54.639> they<00:03:54.790> got

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
not big ones of course because they got

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.580 
not big ones of course because they got
to<00:03:55.030> move<00:03:55.150> on<00:03:55.329> with<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.690> story<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.290> all<00:03:56.379> that

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
to move on with the story and all that

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.520 
to move on with the story and all that
with<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.579> enemies<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.209> all<00:03:58.299> but<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.870> mean<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.410> I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
with the enemies and all but I mean I I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.379 
with the enemies and all but I mean I I
think<00:03:59.799> he's<00:04:00.250> going<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.549> have<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> few<00:04:01.030> because

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
think he's going to have a few because

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.839 
think he's going to have a few because
he's<00:04:02.109> such<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> character<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:03.220> everyone

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
he's such a character that everyone

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.970 
he's such a character that everyone
loves<00:04:04.180> he's<00:04:04.780> such<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> good<00:04:05.560> character<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.510> I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
loves he's such a good character and I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.979 
loves he's such a good character and I
mean<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.430> don't<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:10.180> don't<00:04:10.269> see<00:04:10.480> him<00:04:10.599> getting<00:04:10.720> rid

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
mean I don't I don't see him getting rid

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.770 
mean I don't I don't see him getting rid
of<00:04:11.049> pythor<00:04:11.500> um<00:04:11.829> from<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.669> character<00:04:13.239> lists<00:04:13.629> I

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
of pythor um from the character lists I

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.420 
of pythor um from the character lists I
think<00:04:13.989> every<00:04:14.410> now<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.680> then<00:04:14.769> they<00:04:14.889> always<00:04:15.190> pop

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
think every now and then they always pop

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.550 
think every now and then they always pop
in<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:15.760> characters<00:04:16.239> like<00:04:16.930> they<00:04:17.109> pop<00:04:17.380> in

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
in the characters like they pop in

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.319 
in the characters like they pop in
crunch<00:04:17.859> on<00:04:18.099> knuckle<00:04:18.579> every<00:04:18.849> now<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.209> then

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
crunch on knuckle every now and then

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.140 
crunch on knuckle every now and then
like<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.229> episode<00:04:20.680> 35<00:04:21.310> they<00:04:21.640> have<00:04:21.789> them<00:04:21.909> there

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
like in episode 35 they have them there

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.170 
like in episode 35 they have them there

skeletons and all that but it was and
joggle<00:06:55.639> was<00:06:55.759> basically<00:06:56.150> just<00:06:56.479> kicking<00:06:56.840> off

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
joggle was basically just kicking off

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.570 
joggle was basically just kicking off
still<00:06:57.349> because<00:06:57.710> it<00:06:58.400> had<00:06:58.789> its<00:06:58.930> skeletons<00:07:00.190> but<00:07:01.190> I
