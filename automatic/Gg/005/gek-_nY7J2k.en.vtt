00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
cup make sure you don't add too much

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
cup make sure you don't add too much
because<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.890> add<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:38.280> bit<00:01:38.549> too<00:01:38.729> much

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
because if you add a little bit too much

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
because if you add a little bit too much
then<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> loses<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.259> thickness

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then it kind of loses that thickness

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
then it kind of loses that thickness
when<00:01:40.829> you're<00:01:41.040> looking<00:01:41.969> for<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.210> soft<00:01:42.509> serve

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.930 

okay<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> back<00:02:02.370> there<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
okay so that's on the back there on the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
back burner and now I'm going to get

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.950 
back burner and now I'm going to get
ready<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> make<00:02:05.100> our<00:02:05.280> hot<00:02:06.060> cocoa<00:02:06.450> portion<00:02:06.870> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ready to make our hot cocoa portion of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.620 
ready to make our hot cocoa portion of
the<00:02:07.080> recipe<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.070> again<00:02:08.399> once<00:02:08.700> again<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.420> key

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the recipe so again once again the key

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.720 
the recipe so again once again the key
to<00:02:09.899> having<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.289> successful<00:02:10.320> how<00:02:11.070> cocoa<00:02:11.520> from

to having a successful how cocoa from

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.520 
to having a successful how cocoa from
medifast<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> water<00:02:12.900> needs<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.320> be

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
medifast is that the water needs to be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
medifast is that the water needs to be
super<00:02:14.250> ice<00:02:14.400> cold<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> kind<00:02:15.750> of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
super ice cold and now it's on a kind of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.660 
super ice cold and now it's on a kind of
sounds<00:02:16.080> contradictory<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.490> want<00:02:17.610> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
sounds contradictory that you want to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.830 
sounds contradictory that you want to
make<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:17.970> ice-cold<00:02:18.360> water<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.750> we're

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
make it with ice-cold water and we're

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750 
make it with ice-cold water and we're
making<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.140> hot<00:02:19.320> cocoa<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> case

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
making a hot cocoa but that's the case

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
making a hot cocoa but that's the case
even<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.050> want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> put<00:02:22.410> your

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
even so much if you want to put your

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.320 
even so much if you want to put your
glass<00:02:22.950> into<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> freezer<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.970> little<00:02:24.150> bit

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
glass into the freezer for a little bit

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.940 
glass into the freezer for a little bit
for<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> couple<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> minutes<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.260> even<00:02:25.680> helps

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
for a couple of minutes that even helps

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
for a couple of minutes that even helps
i<00:02:26.010> find<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.580> i'm<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.240> take<00:02:27.420> out

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
i find so i'm going to just take out

these ice cubes and you want to just

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.010 
these ice cubes and you want to just
measure<00:02:30.660> out<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.709> cup<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.459> water<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.000> i'm<00:02:33.870> just

going to use a wire whisk cuz i find
that<00:02:46.709> using<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.100> wire<00:02:47.250> wrist<00:02:47.550> really<00:02:47.940> helps

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
that using the wire wrist really helps

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.699 
that using the wire wrist really helps
break<00:02:48.570> down<00:02:48.660> those<00:02:48.959> little<00:02:49.200> lumps<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
break down those little lumps that you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.500 
break down those little lumps that you
might<00:02:49.890> seem<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:51.090> got<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.270> kind<00:02:51.420> of

just work at it a little bit you know
it's<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.340> happen<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.880> ten

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
it's not going to just happen in ten

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.640 
it's not going to just happen in ten
seconds<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.989> got<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.140> put<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.410> muscle

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
seconds you got to put a little muscle

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.710 
seconds you got to put a little muscle
into<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> we're<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> make<00:02:57.390> our<00:02:57.570> hot
