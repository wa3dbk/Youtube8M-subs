what<00:00:04.800> we<00:00:04.920> do<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.340> take<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:06.510> take<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.870> bricks

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
what we do is we take we take the bricks

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320 
what we do is we take we take the bricks
out<00:00:07.229> of<00:00:07.260> building<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.430> make<00:00:08.639> building<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
out of building and we make building a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.419 
out of building and we make building a
lot<00:00:09.690> more<00:00:10.110> environmentally<00:00:10.830> friendly<00:00:10.860> okay

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
lot more environmentally friendly okay

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.759 
lot more environmentally friendly okay
this<00:00:12.299> is<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> like<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.379> sign

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
this is a like a sign

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
this is a like a sign
eco<00:00:13.950> beam<00:00:14.129> straight<00:00:14.459> into<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.820> product<00:00:15.299> okay

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
eco beam straight into the product okay

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.779 
eco beam straight into the product okay
and<00:00:16.110> what<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.010> pull<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> framework

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and what we do is we pull the framework

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.930 
and what we do is we pull the framework
all<00:00:18.510> right<00:00:18.690> under<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.470> eco<00:00:19.800> beams<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.730> build

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
all right under these eco beams we build

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.960 
all right under these eco beams we build
it<00:00:21.060> lying<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.560> like<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:23.490> connect<00:00:23.850> our

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it lying down like that we connect our

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
it lying down like that we connect our
bottom<00:00:24.300> beam<00:00:24.450> on<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.110> we<00:00:25.200> connect<00:00:25.500> our

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bottom beam on here and we connect our

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.190 
bottom beam on here and we connect our
top<00:00:25.890> beam<00:00:26.100> on<00:00:26.310> there<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.420> put<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:28.170> our

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
top beam on there and we put all our

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.020 
top beam on there and we put all our
beams<00:00:28.620> in<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> want<00:00:29.670> them<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
beams in the way that you want them and

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
beams in the way that you want them and
then<00:00:30.450> we<00:00:30.600> literally<00:00:31.399> pick<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:33.320> okay<00:00:34.610> we

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then we literally pick this up okay we

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.360 
then we literally pick this up okay we
supported<00:00:36.179> like<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:37.499> supports<00:00:38.039> we<00:00:38.190> make

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
supported like that on supports we make

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.180 
supported like that on supports we make
it<00:00:38.519> square<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:38.969> level<00:00:39.140> okay<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:41.039> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it square and level okay and all that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.939 
it square and level okay and all that
framework<00:00:41.519> there<00:00:42.170> is<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> make<00:00:43.920> sure

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
framework there is there to make sure

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.430 
framework there is there to make sure
that<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.329> able<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.839> pack<00:00:46.199> our<00:00:46.409> bags

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
that we are able to pack our bags

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.849 
that we are able to pack our bags
straight<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.429> level<00:00:47.629> okay<00:00:48.659> so<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.589> framework

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
straight and level okay so the framework

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.139 
straight and level okay so the framework
is<00:00:50.249> there<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:51.329> support<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> bags<00:00:52.999> alright<00:00:53.999> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is there to support the bags alright so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
is there to support the bags alright so
the<00:00:54.269> bags<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> main<00:00:55.260> contributing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the bags are the main contributing

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
the bags are the main contributing
factor<00:00:56.429> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> building<00:00:57.059> structure<00:00:57.359> okay

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
factor of the building structure okay

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.079 
factor of the building structure okay
conventional<00:00:58.979> foundation<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.909> would

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
conventional foundation like you would

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.629 
conventional foundation like you would
with<00:01:00.269> with<00:01:00.569> with<00:01:00.870> any<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.350> building<00:01:01.769> okay

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
with with with any other building okay

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:04.729 
with with with any other building okay
the<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.080> different<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the only thing that's different from a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
the only thing that's different from a
conventional<00:01:05.370> building<00:01:05.550> is<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.570> walls

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
conventional building is your walls

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
conventional building is your walls
we've<00:01:07.229> also<00:01:07.409> built<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> sandbag<00:01:08.430> versus

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
we've also built out a sandbag versus

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
we've also built out a sandbag versus
brick<00:01:09.770> once<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> put<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.520> flat<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
brick once you put it down flat like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
brick once you put it down flat like
that<00:01:14.509> right<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.200> pillar<00:01:16.439> slip<00:01:16.680> has<00:01:16.829> not

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that right the pillar slip has not

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.330 
that right the pillar slip has not
closed<00:01:17.219> your<00:01:17.430> bag<00:01:17.670> okay<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.219> turn<00:01:20.219> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
closed your bag okay there turn it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.029 
closed your bag okay there turn it
around<00:01:21.979> there's<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.130> bag<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:24.420> goes<00:01:24.600> down

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
around there's your bag that goes down

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.609 
around there's your bag that goes down
don't<00:01:26.039> worry<00:01:26.219> you<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.820> cool<00:01:27.469> see<00:01:28.469> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
don't worry you go to your cool see that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.599 
don't worry you go to your cool see that
next<00:01:29.039> time<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:33.020> next<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.399> in<00:01:35.399> there<00:01:35.579> now

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
next time in there next one in there now

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:51.859 
next time in there next one in there now
can<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.240> bags<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:36.659> full<00:01:36.869> okay<00:01:42.770> but

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.630 

so<00:01:52.869> we<00:01:53.020> put<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.710> put<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.979> wire<00:01:54.100> mesh<00:01:54.340> on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
so we put the we put the wire mesh on

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.669 
so we put the we put the wire mesh on
and<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.329> cover<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.719> entire<00:01:56.079> structure<00:01:56.439> with

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
and we cover the entire structure with

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.740 
and we cover the entire structure with
wire<00:01:56.890> mesh<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.369> then<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.210> start<00:01:58.479> plastering

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
wire mesh and then we start plastering

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.380 
wire mesh and then we start plastering
through<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.950> wire<00:02:00.159> mesh<00:02:00.429> able<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.240> do<00:02:01.360> a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
through the wire mesh able to do a

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.760 
through the wire mesh able to do a
training<00:02:01.689> course<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.140> we're<00:02:02.259> able<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.590> teach

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
training course and we're able to teach

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.529 
training course and we're able to teach
you<00:02:02.890> how<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.069> build<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.490> way<00:02:03.700> but<00:02:04.390> then
