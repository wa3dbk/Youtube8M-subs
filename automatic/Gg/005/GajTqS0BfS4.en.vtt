00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they're same welds that a AO AO Sigma

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
they're same welds that a AO AO Sigma
duct<00:00:33.540> has<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> same<00:00:34.050> welds<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.829> these

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
duct has the same welds but it's these

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.790 
duct has the same welds but it's these
welds<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.850> from<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> different<00:00:36.180> company

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
welds are from a different company

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
welds are from a different company
district<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.070> Phoenix<00:00:38.520> Dex<00:00:38.790> gets<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> same

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
district in Phoenix Dex gets the same

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.010 
district in Phoenix Dex gets the same
exact<00:00:39.690> welds<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:42.020> strong

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
exact welds so it's really really strong

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
exact welds so it's really really strong
also<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.040> curved<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.610> metal<00:00:44.940> right

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
also it has the curved in metal right

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
also it has the curved in metal right
here<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> convict<00:00:46.920> concave

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
here in that you know is convict concave

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
here in that you know is convict concave
and<00:00:47.700> convex<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> makes<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and convex right here so it makes the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.639 
and convex right here so it makes the
metal<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:49.860> stronger<00:00:50.660> then<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.899> has<00:00:52.079> all

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
metal a lot stronger then it has all

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
metal a lot stronger then it has all
these<00:00:52.949> supports<00:00:53.399> down<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
these supports down in here which is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
these supports down in here which is
gonna<00:00:54.420> make<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> make<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> lot<00:00:55.770> stronger<00:00:56.010> if

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
gonna make the make it a lot stronger if

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
gonna make the make it a lot stronger if
you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.090> walls<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.420> super<00:00:57.539> beefy<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you can see the walls are super beefy as

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.729 
you can see the walls are super beefy as
well<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.960> also<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.260> deck<00:01:01.469> plate

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
well down there also the deck plate

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
well down there also the deck plate
keeps<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.399> bending<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> really

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
keeps it from bending so it's a really

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
keeps it from bending so it's a really
nice<00:01:03.690> feature<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> keeps<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> strong<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.920> well

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
nice feature it keeps it strong as well

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.260 
nice feature it keeps it strong as well
it<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:07.100> 20.5<00:01:08.100> long<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.090> nice<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it is 20.5 long so it's really nice for

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
it is 20.5 long so it's really nice for
if<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> bigger<00:01:10.439> rider<00:01:10.710> taller<00:01:11.010> rider

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
if you're a bigger rider taller rider

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
if you're a bigger rider taller rider
you<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.119> foot<00:01:12.330> room

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you have more foot room

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
you have more foot room
it<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.460> concave<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> Reddington

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it has concave just like the Reddington

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
it has concave just like the Reddington
I<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.770> say<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> deck<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> best

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I would say this deck is one of the best
