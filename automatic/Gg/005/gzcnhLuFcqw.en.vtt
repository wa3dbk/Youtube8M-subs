investors<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.770> game<00:01:46.979> though<00:01:47.130> maybe

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
investors in that game though maybe

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.560 
investors in that game though maybe
they're<00:01:47.579> fearing<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.149> won't<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.450> able

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
doing a good enough job well this is the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
doing a good enough job well this is the
question<00:01:53.159> isn't<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> looking<00:01:54.360> far

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
question isn't maybe is it looking far

question isn't maybe is it looking far
enough<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:55.710> already<00:01:56.399> google<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
enough what already google is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
enough what already google is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
all if we suddenly got autonomous

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039 
all if we suddenly got autonomous
vehicles<00:02:05.340> yeah<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.299> will<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:07.020> a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
future is and the fact that we're not

going to have car service is all gonna

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.590 
going to have car service is all gonna
have<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:01.920> say<00:03:02.040> hailing<00:03:02.490> apps<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:03.300> for

have as we say hailing apps but for

you<00:03:05.460> know<00:03:05.550> visionary<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.180> terms<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.480> tag<00:03:06.690> but

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
you know visionary in terms of tag but

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.840 
you know visionary in terms of tag but
this<00:03:07.140> sounds<00:03:07.320> like<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.740> bus<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> bus<00:03:08.640> or<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
this sounds like a bus to be a bus or a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.060 
this sounds like a bus to be a bus or a
tram<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.020> smaller<00:03:10.260> no<00:03:10.710> it's<00:03:10.860> just

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
tram it's just a smaller no it's just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.680 
tram it's just a smaller no it's just
it's<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:12.330> more<00:03:12.450> Taylor

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
it's just it but it's more Taylor

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.370 
it's just it but it's more Taylor
because<00:03:12.870> everything<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.290> becoming

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
because everything is becoming

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.140 
because everything is becoming
increasingly<00:03:13.710> bespoke<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
increasingly bespoke and this is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.930 
increasingly bespoke and this is
effectively<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.930> bespoke<00:03:16.440> bus<00:03:16.770> but<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.820> will

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
effectively a bespoke bus but you will

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.470 
effectively a bespoke bus but you will
share<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.410> your<00:03:19.920> own<00:03:20.070> many<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.489> ya<00:03:20.640> or<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
share it and your own many of ya or and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.910 
share it and your own many of ya or and
that<00:03:21.600> would<00:03:21.720> potentially<00:03:22.050> reduce<00:03:22.590> how<00:03:22.770> many

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that would potentially reduce how many

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.040 
that would potentially reduce how many
cars<00:03:23.250> get<00:03:23.459> parked<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.480> reduce<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> number

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
cars get parked so you reduce the number

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.630 
cars get parked so you reduce the number
of<00:03:25.080> cars<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.410> are<00:03:25.560> parks<00:03:25.830> ugc<00:03:26.250> number<00:03:26.520> of

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
of cars that are parks ugc number of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
of cars that are parks ugc number of
vehicles<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.480> are<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.660> London<00:03:27.989> or<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.500> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
vehicles that are in London or one of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.229 
vehicles that are in London or one of
the<00:03:28.680> other<00:03:28.800> major<00:03:29.040> cities<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.940> can<00:03:30.120> see

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
the other major cities so you can see

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.670 
the other major cities so you can see
the<00:03:30.360> advantages<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.959> yeah<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> bus

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the advantages this yeah it is a bus

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
the advantages this yeah it is a bus
that's<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:32.940> long<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> car<00:03:33.510> doesn't

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that's just as long as the car doesn't

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.229 
that's just as long as the car doesn't
smell<00:03:33.959> that's<00:03:34.170> all<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.350> have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.680> say<00:03:34.709> nah<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.670> ok

sort of air conditioning yeah what the
ulcer<00:03:40.350> assist<00:03:40.620> here<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.100> mean<00:03:41.459> what's

interesting<00:03:41.880> though<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.110> other

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
interesting though is that the other

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.590 
interesting though is that the other
rival<00:03:44.340> reports<00:03:44.790> are<00:03:44.910> coming<00:03:44.970> out<00:03:45.209> saying<00:03:45.390> look

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
rival reports are coming out saying look

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.420 
rival reports are coming out saying look
with<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.440> perhaps<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.769> bit<00:03:46.920> over

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
with this is perhaps a bit over

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.060 
with this is perhaps a bit over
exaggerating<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.180> situation<00:03:48.410> Google<00:03:49.410> for

home yeah this isn't a direct threat to
uber<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.830> indeed<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.790> also<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.239> that

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
uber and indeed we also know that

it's<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:29.870> interesting<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.350> Google

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
it's just so interesting that Google

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.410 
it's just so interesting that Google
basically<00:04:31.310> has<00:04:31.460> skin<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.850> game<00:04:31.880> whichever

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
basically has skin in the game whichever

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.150 
basically has skin in the game whichever
way<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.720> goes<00:04:32.780> they're<00:04:33.290> developing<00:04:33.710> Ordonez

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
way it goes they're developing Ordonez

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.770 
way it goes they're developing Ordonez
cars<00:04:34.370> their<00:04:34.640> way<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.420> will<00:04:35.510> soak<00:04:35.660> up

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
cars their way that it will soak up

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.480 
cars their way that it will soak up
money<00:04:36.050> bet<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.380> uber<00:04:36.680> if<00:04:36.830> perhaps<00:04:37.040> there<00:04:37.250> one

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
money bet on uber if perhaps there one

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.580 
money bet on uber if perhaps there one
doesn't<00:04:37.760> work<00:04:37.850> out<00:04:38.030> yeah<00:04:38.270> if<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:39.050> keeps<00:04:39.440> them

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
doesn't work out yeah if it keeps them

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.220 
doesn't work out yeah if it keeps them
along<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.190> ride<00:04:40.660> yeah<00:04:41.660> well<00:04:42.110> if<00:04:42.170> you

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
along for the ride yeah well if you

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.660 
along for the ride yeah well if you
going<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.500> stake<00:04:42.740> it's<00:04:43.130> quite<00:04:43.340> hard<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.520> get

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
going the stake it's quite hard to get

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.860 
going the stake it's quite hard to get
rid<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.820> them<00:04:43.940> in<00:04:44.030> some<00:04:44.210> certain<00:04:44.510> instances

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
rid of them in some certain instances

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.780 
rid of them in some certain instances
I'll<00:04:45.380> have<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.590> see<00:04:45.890> whether<00:04:46.190> they<00:04:46.370> depend<00:04:46.700> a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
I'll have to see whether they depend a
