00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.640
 and now according to your numerous 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 comments under my video about 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.050
 ubiquitin bloom growling and people who 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.460
 going to read the comments that I 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.650
 have become under the comments about shout I 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.020
 I will make you a video about how the hell are you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 can place these chat over the game 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
 and be able to read these chat and in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 game time if you don't have a second 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 monitors or 3 monitors or three 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.500
 monitors tablet and laptop like mine 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.329
 and so for this and rose case i 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 I will consider two cases we need 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 the game is running in full-screen window 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 borderless mode 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 some manufacturers use 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 various variations of this term but the essence 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 one and the same board os windows full 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 screen 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 and so now let's see how 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.129
 we can do it for evidence we Tusa 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.800

 and clicks true window hold control the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
 then rebug lies you can 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.659
 click directly through the chat window 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.810
