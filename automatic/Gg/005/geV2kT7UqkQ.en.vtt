doesn't have a set like the rest of them
have<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.210> set<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:52.780> category<00:02:53.620> hinges<00:02:54.810> or

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
have a set like category hinges or

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.780 
have a set like category hinges or
category<00:02:56.500> fishies<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:58.570> for<00:02:58.960> Zach<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.790> also

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
category fishies but for Zach and also

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.980 
category fishies but for Zach and also
for<00:03:03.270> some<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.450> others<00:03:04.660> they<00:03:04.750> don't<00:03:04.900> even

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
for some of the others they don't even

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.750 
for some of the others they don't even
have<00:03:05.140> set<00:03:05.560> names<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.780> Bobby<00:03:08.140> sing<00:03:08.470> songs<00:03:08.800> but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
have set names like Bobby sing songs but

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.010 
have set names like Bobby sing songs but
this<00:03:09.850> nice<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.390> does<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> new

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
this nice because it does have the new

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.720 
this nice because it does have the new
ones<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.650> missions<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
ones that you get missions to the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.610 
ones that you get missions to the
previous<00:03:13.150> book<00:03:13.360> didn't<00:03:13.690> show<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.440> ones

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
previous book didn't show you the ones

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.970 
previous book didn't show you the ones
that<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.160> got<00:03:15.310> missions<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.740> ones<00:03:17.920> that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
that you got missions but the ones that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.500 
that you got missions but the ones that
you<00:03:18.130> get<00:03:18.250> missions<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.790> doesn't<00:03:19.030> tell<00:03:19.240> you<00:03:19.270> how

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
you get missions it doesn't tell you how

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.510 
you get missions it doesn't tell you how
to<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.990> it<00:03:20.500> doesn't<00:03:20.830> say<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> get<00:03:21.400> it

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
to get it it doesn't say that you get it

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.640 
to get it it doesn't say that you get it
from<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.760> mission<00:03:22.060> or<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.270> doesn't<00:03:22.390> say<00:03:22.750> what

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
from a mission or it doesn't say what

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.780 
from a mission or it doesn't say what
code<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.910> once<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.840> need<00:03:26.050> code<00:03:26.320> for

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
code and once that you do need code for

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.500 
code and once that you do need code for
like<00:03:27.790> oh<00:03:28.770> really<00:03:30.000> doesn't<00:03:31.000> have<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.270> code

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
like oh really doesn't have the code

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680 
like oh really doesn't have the code
either

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.890 

so<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.590> pretty<00:03:36.950> good<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.420> doesn't

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
so this is pretty good but it doesn't

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.690 
so this is pretty good but it doesn't
have<00:03:39.170> any<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.620> codes<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.190> assume<00:03:40.490> because

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
have any of the codes I assume because

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.660 
have any of the codes I assume because
some<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.090> them<00:03:41.240> aren't<00:03:41.570> out<00:03:41.870> yet<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.670> because

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
some of them aren't out yet so because

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
some of them aren't out yet so because
you're<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:43.940> out<00:03:44.120> yet<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.510> wouldn't<00:03:44.810> show<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
you're not out yet it wouldn't show the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.530 
you're not out yet it wouldn't show the
codes<00:03:45.620> for<00:03:46.130> them<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.700> got<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.000> table

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
codes for them here it's got the table

00:03:47.540 --> 00:04:00.070 
codes for them here it's got the table
the<00:03:47.990> index<00:03:50.770> really<00:03:51.770> is<00:03:51.860> on<00:03:52.010> page<00:03:52.220> 144

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.470 

there<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.800> this<00:04:01.550> one<00:04:01.760> everyone<00:04:02.120> knows<00:04:02.300> the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
there is this one everyone knows the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.990 
there is this one everyone knows the
code<00:04:02.690> for<00:04:02.960> now<00:04:03.170> online<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.160> they<00:04:04.310> even<00:04:04.760> showed

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
code for now online and they even showed

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.560 
code for now online and they even showed
the<00:04:05.180> coat<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.250> news<00:04:07.610> for<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
the coat on the on the news for the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.590 
the coat on the on the news for the
moshi<00:04:08.840> site<00:04:09.200> but<00:04:09.530> they<00:04:09.680> don't<00:04:10.100> have<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:11.270> code

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
moshi site but they don't have the code

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.730 
moshi site but they don't have the code
here<00:04:12.140> at<00:04:12.320> all<00:04:12.470> there's<00:04:12.830> no<00:04:13.870> code<00:04:14.870> for<00:04:15.230> him<00:04:15.470> or

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
here at all there's no code for him or

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.280 
here at all there's no code for him or
any<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.640> other<00:04:16.790> new<00:04:17.000> ones<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:18.140> it's

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
any of the other new ones and it's

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.690 
any of the other new ones and it's
probably<00:04:18.500> because<00:04:18.830> they're<00:04:19.160> not<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.430> yet<00:04:19.459> so

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
probably because they're not out yet so

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.400 
probably because they're not out yet so
if<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.120> try<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.359> use<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.810> code<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.109> wouldn't

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
if you try to use the code it wouldn't

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.020 
if you try to use the code it wouldn't
work<00:04:21.530> because<00:04:21.830> they<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.400> haven't<00:04:22.760> released

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
work because they just haven't released

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.030 
work because they just haven't released
them<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.080> think<00:04:24.200> they<00:04:24.440> kind<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.770> release

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
them so I think they kind of release

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.910 
them so I think they kind of release
this<00:04:25.220> book<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.520> little<00:04:25.640> early<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.440> recommend

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
this book a little early so I recommend

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.890 
this book a little early so I recommend
it<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.460> want<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.910> see<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.210> information

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
it if you want to see the information

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.240 
it if you want to see the information
about<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.110> new<00:04:30.320> motion<00:04:30.530> things<00:04:30.830> like<00:04:31.010> if<00:04:31.160> you

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
about the new motion things like if you

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.030 
about the new motion things like if you
want<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.550> see<00:04:31.670> their<00:04:31.850> names<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.750> their<00:04:33.710> likes

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
want to see their names and their likes

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.880 
want to see their names and their likes
and<00:04:34.250> dislikes<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.470> descriptions<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.650> stuff

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
and dislikes and descriptions and stuff

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.650 
and dislikes and descriptions and stuff
because<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.220> think<00:04:37.280> that's<00:04:37.610> cool<00:04:37.970> i<00:04:38.240> really

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
because I think that's cool i really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.690 
because I think that's cool i really
like<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.140> kind<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.410> thing<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:39.950> if<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.490> want

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
like that kind of thing but if you want

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.240 
like that kind of thing but if you want
to<00:04:40.940> find<00:04:41.150> codes<00:04:41.540> or<00:04:42.050> information<00:04:42.860> on<00:04:43.010> that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
to find codes or information on that

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.950 
to find codes or information on that
information<00:04:43.820> on<00:04:44.090> how<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.240> get<00:04:44.480> them<00:04:44.720> and

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
information on how to get them and

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.770 
information on how to get them and
probably<00:04:45.530> don't<00:04:46.160> get<00:04:46.370> this<00:04:46.610> one<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.090> maybe

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
probably don't get this one and maybe

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.390 
probably don't get this one and maybe
wait<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.320> another<00:04:48.470> guy<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.770> come<00:04:49.070> out<00:04:49.220> that

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
wait for another guy to come out that

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.220 
wait for another guy to come out that
has<00:04:49.550> all<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.880> them<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.240> mean<00:04:50.810> I'm<00:04:50.900> probably<00:04:51.110> just

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
has all of them I mean I'm probably just

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.980 
has all of them I mean I'm probably just
going<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> like<00:04:51.680> tape<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.190> codes<00:04:52.400> on<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.670> side

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
going to like tape the codes on the side

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.680 
going to like tape the codes on the side
when<00:04:53.990> when<00:04:54.350> they<00:04:54.470> come<00:04:54.680> out<00:04:54.940> but<00:04:55.940> that's<00:04:56.390> just

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690
