00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.860 
so far I think she's right cuz I do like
it<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.620> don't<00:02:17.920> know<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> video<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.540> doing

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it I don't know if the video is doing

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.150 
it I don't know if the video is doing
any<00:02:20.110> justice<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.500> um<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.070> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
any justice but I do like it um and it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.700 
any justice but I do like it um and it
is<00:02:24.280> thin<00:02:24.670> too<00:02:24.970> though<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.470> maybe

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
is thin too though it is then but maybe

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.760 
is thin too though it is then but maybe
if<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.490> work<00:02:27.850> for<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> couple<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.690> days<00:02:29.110> it'll<00:02:29.650> get

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
if I work for a couple of days it'll get

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.230 
if I work for a couple of days it'll get
thicker<00:02:30.070> because<00:02:30.460> sometimes<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.120> just

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
thicker because sometimes you just

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.540 
thicker because sometimes you just
needed<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:32.050> older<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.710> maybe

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
needed to get a little older so maybe

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.180 
needed to get a little older so maybe
then<00:02:34.390> they'll<00:02:34.570> do<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:36.040> um<00:02:37.260> yeah<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:39.160> it

straightening out I don't really care

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.770 
straightening out I don't really care
cuz<00:04:23.890> it's<00:04:24.070> synthetic

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
cuz it's synthetic

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.470 
cuz it's synthetic
it<00:04:24.930> sheds<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.830> week<00:04:26.070> shirts<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.940> when<00:04:27.420> you

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
it sheds this week shirts and when you

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.240 
it sheds this week shirts and when you
get<00:04:27.630> synthetic<00:04:28.139> how<00:04:28.290> much<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.830> expect

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
get synthetic how much you want expect

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.980 
get synthetic how much you want expect
this<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.790> it's<00:04:29.970> not<00:04:30.090> human<00:04:30.420> hair<00:04:30.660> you

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
this to that it's not human hair you

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.470 
this to that it's not human hair you
know<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:32.250> think<00:04:32.370> for<00:04:32.580> synthetic<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.330> is

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
know so I think for synthetic this is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.320 
know so I think for synthetic this is
really<00:04:33.660> nice<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:35.100> just<00:04:35.370> let<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.669> know<00:04:35.820> hope

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
really nice so just let you know hope

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.790 
really nice so just let you know hope

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800

it<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.780> might<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:40.080> think<00:04:40.470> about<00:04:40.620> adding<00:04:40.830> pieces

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
it I might I'm think about adding pieces

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.800 
it I might I'm think about adding pieces
but<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.550> don't<00:04:41.760> know<00:04:41.880> because<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.300> isn't<00:04:42.630> that

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
but I don't know because it isn't that
