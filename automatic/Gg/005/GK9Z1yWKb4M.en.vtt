00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.590
 o was in an application is via satellite 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.240
 There are several challenges there 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 so mileage challenges 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.939
 accumulation of mountain climbs 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.800
 a new concept of competition is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 of dispute 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 For me it was the cycling revolution, and I 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.260
 I leave home, I will not start and it will start. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 speed is set at altitude and has 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.710
 some disputes on the streets of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.500
 Paul in the whole world, right? 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.870
 you get a strong climb and already 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 Beat them, they already get one. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.789
 virtual trophy I got to pass 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.609
 the guy who pedaled most in the world in 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.800
 March and the Australian who left on TVs 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.589
 Entire the world I got to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.110
 to win from him only that he had on that one 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.520
 cheat something that got me out of this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 first in the ranking in March understood 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.640
 which were 5 thousand kilometers in one month 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.820
 I and god I closed on the 1st Saturday I 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.090
 I was in first and there was this one 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 fraga and everything and put me in tenth 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 placed in the world is I accumulated is 68 thousand 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.229
 meters is accumulation of mountains understood 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.259
 up in 15 days 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.439
 and the second is that whoever is first 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149
 he accumulated 57 thousand meters not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 that he had to pay 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.610
 Italy to accumulate the time that there 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.939
 not in the records of Italy with more than 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 in Australia he does not have that attitude 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.710
 I would have to go, it was not because 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 It's what made me it's reborn again, it's like 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.420
 if you were to pedal with 14 years of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.420
 This makes me happy yet. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.630
 understood 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.630
 ae
