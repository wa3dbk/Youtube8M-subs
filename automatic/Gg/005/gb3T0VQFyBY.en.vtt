00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.249 

I<00:00:00.770> saw<00:00:01.770> some<00:00:01.949> posts<00:00:02.340> online<00:00:03.259> questioning

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
I saw some posts online questioning

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.780 
I saw some posts online questioning
about<00:00:04.440> how<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.629> make<00:00:06.629> metal<00:00:07.250> sounding<00:00:08.250> rich

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
about how to make metal sounding rich

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.720 
about how to make metal sounding rich
without<00:00:09.510> just<00:00:09.870> using<00:00:10.170> power<00:00:10.320> chords<00:00:10.800> well<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
without just using power chords well I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.299 
without just using power chords well I
assumed<00:00:12.420> when<00:00:13.290> somebody<00:00:13.590> says<00:00:13.769> power<00:00:13.980> chords

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
assumed when somebody says power chords

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
assumed when somebody says power chords
that<00:00:14.460> generally<00:00:14.759> mean<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> perfect<00:00:15.780> fifth

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
that generally mean the perfect fifth

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.130 
that generally mean the perfect fifth
based<00:00:16.590> power<00:00:16.859> chord<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.970> example<00:00:18.449> this

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710 

now<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> guess<00:00:22.950> a<00:00:23.160> lot<00:00:23.370> of<00:00:23.430> music<00:00:23.850> uses<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
now I guess a lot of music uses just the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.030 
now I guess a lot of music uses just the
Pritikin<00:00:25.170> power<00:00:25.590> chords<00:00:25.920> later<00:00:30.950> but<00:00:31.950> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
Pritikin power chords later but of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
Pritikin power chords later but of
course<00:00:32.250> other<00:00:32.669> than<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.930> other

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
course other than that you can do other

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.150 
course other than that you can do other
types<00:00:34.560> of<00:00:34.770> power<00:00:34.920> chords<00:00:36.110> for<00:00:37.110> example<00:00:37.560> into

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
types of power chords for example into

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
types of power chords for example into
the<00:00:38.250> perfect<00:00:38.460> fifth<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.150> perfect

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the perfect fifth you do a perfect

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.950 
the perfect fifth you do a perfect
fourth

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.600 

I<00:00:41.990> know<00:00:42.470> some<00:00:42.710> people<00:00:42.860> prefer<00:00:43.130> this<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.520> an

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
I know some people prefer this is an

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.460 
I know some people prefer this is an
inverted<00:00:44.030> power<00:00:44.300> cord<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:44.720> it's<00:00:44.870> not<00:00:45.200> really

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
inverted power cord but it's not really

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.300 
inverted power cord but it's not really
inverted<00:00:46.040> exactly<00:00:48.010> because<00:00:49.010> you've<00:00:49.160> got

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
inverted exactly because you've got

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.270 
inverted exactly because you've got
normally<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.660> root<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:52.670> perfect<00:00:53.510> fit<00:00:54.280> button

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
normally the root the perfect fit button

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.240 
normally the root the perfect fit button
the<00:00:55.790> octave<00:00:57.400> but<00:00:58.400> here<00:00:58.610> you've<00:00:58.760> got<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.060> roof

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
the octave but here you've got the roof

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.439 
the octave but here you've got the roof
the<00:01:01.250> perfect<00:01:01.640> force<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:03.320> then<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.530> actus<00:01:04.449> we

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the perfect force and then the actus we

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.500 
the perfect force and then the actus we
also<00:01:05.600> extend<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.110> by<00:01:06.200> adding<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.270> octave<00:01:08.270> of

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
also extend it by adding the octave of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.650 
also extend it by adding the octave of
the<00:01:09.280> fourth<00:01:10.280> which<00:01:10.730> then<00:01:11.060> makes<00:01:11.270> kind<00:01:11.510> of<00:01:11.570> like

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
the fourth which then makes kind of like

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.500 
the fourth which then makes kind of like
an<00:01:11.750> extended<00:01:12.850> like<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:13.940> this<00:01:14.060> case<00:01:14.270> would<00:01:14.479> be

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
an extended like in this case would be

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.400 
an extended like in this case would be
an<00:01:14.660> extended<00:01:15.080> C<00:01:15.860> power<00:01:16.100> chord<00:01:16.400> with<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.229> G<00:01:18.229> in

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
an extended C power chord with the G in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.090 
an extended C power chord with the G in
the<00:01:18.530> root<00:01:19.660> but<00:01:20.660> for<00:01:20.869> example<00:01:20.930> if<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.710> did<00:01:22.010> it

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the root but for example if you did it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.859 
the root but for example if you did it
with<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> perfect<00:01:22.760> for<00:01:22.910> if<00:01:22.970> instead<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.330> 450

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
with a perfect for if instead of 450

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:33.300 
with a perfect for if instead of 450
blase<00:01:25.150> here<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:29.300> could<00:01:29.390> also<00:01:29.450> change<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.900> by

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.070 

extending<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.060> by<00:01:35.450> keeping<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.869> as<00:01:36.050> a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
extending it and by keeping it as a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.170 
extending it and by keeping it as a
first<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.280> fifth<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:37.729> changing<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
first and a fifth but changing the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.200 
first and a fifth but changing the
octave<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> ninth<00:01:39.950> instead<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> eighth

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.560 

gives<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.300> kind<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.630> bigger<00:01:47.840> bigger<00:01:48.320> sound

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860 

also<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:56.810> you're<00:01:57.080> changing<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:58.540> eight<00:01:59.540> to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
also if you're changing the the eight to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.070 
also if you're changing the the eight to
another<00:02:00.080> note<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:01.250> can<00:02:01.400> also<00:02:01.520> push<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.479> back<00:02:02.720> a

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
another note you can also push it back a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.910 
another note you can also push it back a
half<00:02:03.530> step

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.660 

doesn't<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.190> works<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:09.350> metal<00:02:09.830> depending<00:02:10.490> on

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
doesn't it works in metal depending on

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.190 
doesn't it works in metal depending on
the<00:02:11.060> what<00:02:11.270> chords<00:02:11.600> is<00:02:11.720> surrounded<00:02:12.170> by

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
the what chords is surrounded by

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.330 
the what chords is surrounded by
obviously<00:02:12.530> if<00:02:12.770> you're<00:02:12.860> just<00:02:12.950> gonna<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.190> doing

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
obviously if you're just gonna be doing

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.300 
obviously if you're just gonna be doing
like

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.190 

it's<00:02:19.240> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> make<00:02:19.569> us<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:19.840> bit<00:02:20.050> more

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
it's going to make us a little bit more

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's going to make us a little bit more
of<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.380> punk<00:02:20.680> or<00:02:20.920> email<00:02:21.220> or<00:02:21.250> something<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:21.760> if

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
of a punk or email or something but if

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:32.760 
of a punk or email or something but if
you're<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.180> know<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:31.319> like<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> guess

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
you're you know like I like that I guess

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.120 
you're you know like I like that I guess
it<00:02:32.890> works<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.370> there<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.770> there's<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.100> course

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it works in there then there's of course

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.059 
it works in there then there's of course
the<00:02:36.550> tritone<00:02:37.060> where<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:38.230> take<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.739> perfect

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
the tritone where you take the perfect

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.630 
the tritone where you take the perfect
fifth<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.230> flatten<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.319> half-step<00:02:41.739> you've

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
fifth and you flatten a half-step you've

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.170 
fifth and you flatten a half-step you've
got<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.860> flatted<00:02:44.860> fifth<00:02:45.130> which<00:02:45.850> was<00:02:46.000> known<00:02:46.150> as

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
got a flatted fifth which was known as

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.830 
got a flatted fifth which was known as
the<00:02:46.420> devil's<00:02:47.020> interval<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:49.510> basically

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
the devil's interval that's basically

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.040 
the devil's interval that's basically
you've<00:02:50.110> got<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> regular<00:02:50.590> power<00:02:50.769> chord

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
you've got the regular power chord

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
you've got the regular power chord
flatness<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.080> you've<00:02:53.320> got<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.030> tritone<00:02:56.070> this

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
flatness and you've got the tritone this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.699 
flatness and you've got the tritone this
is<00:02:57.160> really<00:02:57.370> cool

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.059 

stuff<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:06.769> then<00:03:07.769> there's<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.040> course

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
stuff like that then there's of course

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.050 
stuff like that then there's of course
where<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:10.170> can<00:03:10.200> change<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.069> route<00:03:11.489> from<00:03:11.730> not

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
where you can change the route from not

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.880 
where you can change the route from not
just<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.299> perfect<00:03:12.629> 5th<00:03:12.840> flatted<00:03:13.230> fifth<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:13.830> a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
just a perfect 5th flatted fifth or a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.910 
just a perfect 5th flatted fifth or a
fourth<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.879> can<00:03:15.000> change<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
fourth but you can change it to like a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.440 
fourth but you can change it to like a
major<00:03:16.920> third<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.459> minor<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.060> made<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.330> go

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
major third or minor if it's made to go

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:34.570 
major third or minor if it's made to go
do<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.569> like<00:03:22.280> minor<00:03:25.190> minor<00:03:26.190> throw<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.819> be<00:03:26.940> like

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.650 

I<00:03:35.140> usually<00:03:36.140> don't<00:03:36.440> put<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.360> positive<00:03:38.360> in

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
I usually don't put the positive in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.820 
I usually don't put the positive in
there<00:03:38.810> when<00:03:38.930> I'm<00:03:38.990> doing<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.290> but<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.680> did

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
there when I'm doing that but if you did

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.240 
there when I'm doing that but if you did
it'd<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.040> like

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.450 

then<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.330> course<00:03:45.390> uh<00:03:45.870> outside<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:47.100> chords<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
then of course uh outside of chords you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.940 
then of course uh outside of chords you
can<00:03:47.490> do<00:03:47.670> single<00:03:48.000> note<00:03:48.330> riffs<00:03:49.020> we're<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.440> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
can do single note riffs we're just you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.170 
can do single note riffs we're just you
know<00:03:50.070> instead<00:03:50.460> of<00:03:50.580> playing<00:03:50.820> power<00:03:51.120> chords

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
know instead of playing power chords

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.700 
know instead of playing power chords
you're<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.690> doing<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.020> riffs<00:03:52.290> off<00:03:52.560> of

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
you're just doing like riffs off of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:03.260 
you're just doing like riffs off of
single<00:03:53.220> notes<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.210> ah<00:04:02.270> see

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
single notes like so like that ah see

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.120 
single notes like so like that ah see
what<00:04:03.420> else<00:04:03.570> is<00:04:03.750> there<00:04:05.209> hmm<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.890> course

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
what else is there hmm you can of course

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.310 
what else is there hmm you can of course
do<00:04:08.430> regular<00:04:09.000> chords<00:04:09.420> as<00:04:09.570> well<00:04:09.780> although

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
do regular chords as well although

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.340 
do regular chords as well although
depending<00:04:10.770> on<00:04:10.860> how<00:04:10.950> much<00:04:11.100> gain<00:04:11.400> you're<00:04:11.610> using

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
depending on how much gain you're using

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.500 
depending on how much gain you're using
it<00:04:13.350> might<00:04:13.620> not<00:04:13.860> be<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> good<00:04:14.160> idea<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.700> find<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
it might not be a good idea I find that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.360 
it might not be a good idea I find that
more<00:04:15.870> simple<00:04:16.380> straightforward<00:04:16.620> chords<00:04:17.130> like

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
more simple straightforward chords like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.750 
more simple straightforward chords like
a<00:04:18.320> minor<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.620> major<00:04:20.160> chords<00:04:20.640> will<00:04:20.910> work<00:04:21.090> like

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.500 

well<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.850> course<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.120> gets<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.270> little<00:04:27.360> bit

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
well of course it gets a little bit

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.850 
well of course it gets a little bit
muddy<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.610> obviously<00:04:30.419> major<00:04:30.810> isn't<00:04:31.169> usually

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
muddy and obviously major isn't usually

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.620 
muddy and obviously major isn't usually
something<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.370> people<00:04:32.880> usually<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.419> to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
something that people usually want to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.350 
something that people usually want to
play<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.870> middle<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.980> works<00:04:35.220> depending<00:04:36.210> on

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
play in middle but it works depending on

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:49.690 
play in middle but it works depending on
what<00:04:36.510> it's<00:04:36.630> surrounded<00:04:36.960> by

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.630 

but<00:04:50.630> basically<00:04:51.020> anything<00:04:51.290> can<00:04:51.530> be<00:04:51.590> metal<00:04:51.800> if

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
but basically anything can be metal if

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.210 
but basically anything can be metal if
you<00:04:52.850> know<00:04:52.970> how<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.150> play<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.480> right<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:54.070> think<00:04:55.070> I

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
you know how to play it right I think I

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.880 
you know how to play it right I think I
hope<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.580> helps<00:04:55.820> you
