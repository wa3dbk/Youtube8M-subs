we all know the old classic games like
this<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.590> mean<00:00:17.690> more<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.110> a<00:00:19.170> sense<00:00:19.350> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
this I mean more to do have a sense of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.020 
this I mean more to do have a sense of
imagination<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.340> these<00:00:20.490> ones<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.910> do

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
imagination with these ones what we do

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.160 
imagination with these ones what we do
remember<00:00:21.360> them<00:00:21.540> so<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.050> they

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
remember them so this is where they

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.780 
remember them so this is where they
started<00:00:22.620> off<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.950> old<00:00:23.070> shoot-'em-ups<00:00:23.580> and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
options menu allowed one or two player

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.849 
options menu allowed one or two player
so<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.989> going<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.170> go<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:32.590> player

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
so I'm going to go for one player

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.949 
so I'm going to go for one player
obviously<00:03:33.040> there's<00:03:33.730> only<00:03:33.880> one<00:03:34.060> person<00:03:34.630> here

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
obviously there's only one person here

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.330 
obviously there's only one person here
don't<00:03:35.290> think<00:03:35.440> Ryan<00:03:35.650> wants<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:35.920> play<00:03:36.099> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
don't think Ryan wants to play and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.729 
don't think Ryan wants to play and
here's<00:03:37.060> your<00:03:37.209> ship<00:03:37.420> select<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.260> does<00:03:38.410> vary

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
here's your ship select and it does vary

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.349 
here's your ship select and it does vary
because<00:03:38.950> if<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> pick<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.669> ship<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.209> lot

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
because if you pick that ship it's a lot

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.819 
because if you pick that ship it's a lot
slower<00:03:40.599> but<00:03:40.989> you've<00:03:41.139> got<00:03:41.290> an<00:03:41.410> actual<00:03:41.560> more

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
powerful main gun tar underneath but

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.870 
powerful main gun tar underneath but
you've<00:03:44.440> got<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.680> lighter<00:03:44.919> more<00:03:45.280> maneuverable

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you've got the lighter more maneuverable

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.819 
you've got the lighter more maneuverable
this<00:03:46.030> ship<00:03:46.750> here<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.169> you<00:03:47.349> can<00:03:47.470> choose<00:03:47.680> your

a<00:04:10.660> damn<00:04:10.900> good<00:04:11.169> game<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:12.430> ship<00:04:12.609> is

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
a damn good game and the ship is

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.129 
a damn good game and the ship is
equipped<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.269> two<00:04:13.540> different<00:04:13.750> forms<00:04:14.019> of

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
equipped with two different forms of

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.900 
equipped with two different forms of
weapon<00:04:14.410> after<00:04:14.590> each<00:04:14.950> level<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.430> go<00:04:15.700> into<00:04:15.880> a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
weapon after each level you go into a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.539 
weapon after each level you go into a
Jumpgate<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.599> jump<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.989> next<00:04:17.019> one<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:18.340> it's

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
Jumpgate to jump to the next one so it's

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.870 
Jumpgate to jump to the next one so it's
pretty<00:04:18.729> self-explanatory<00:04:19.440> as<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.469> said<00:04:20.880> just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
pretty self-explanatory as I said just

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.490 
pretty self-explanatory as I said just
by<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.090> intro<00:04:22.479> alone<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.169> think<00:04:23.409> your

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
by the intro alone you you think your

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.879 
by the intro alone you you think your
infrared

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
infrared

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.059 
infrared
in<00:04:24.159> game<00:04:24.659> and<00:04:25.659> here<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.110> are<00:04:26.259> here<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.860> game

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
now as I said you got an outside view

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.089 
now as I said you got an outside view
you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.680> check<00:04:29.860> lots<00:04:30.069> of<00:04:30.219> different<00:04:30.490> targets

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
you can check lots of different targets

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.230 
you can check lots of different targets
that's<00:04:33.099> your<00:04:33.249> shield<00:04:33.490> week<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:33.909> reigns<00:04:34.120> with

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
often and the inside view which I

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.390 
often and the inside view which I
think's<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.199> lot<00:04:38.319> better<00:04:38.469> now<00:04:38.800> hide<00:04:39.069> your<00:04:39.249> stash
