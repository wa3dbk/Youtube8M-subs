00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.120
 and today and one of the activities 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.389
 fun you can use to 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.230
 teach your child to focus attention 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.199
 and to recognize sounds is to use 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.400
 for example a game like the phone 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.240
 which is done with two glasses and with one 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 line 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.119
 of thread or with something similar that you have in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 home this is very easy to do what 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.660
 only thing you have to do is that you take 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.370
 the glass makes a small hole here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 and you put the thread line 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.340
 I am using the glasses of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.440
 plastic 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 because they are easier to work with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.320
 they 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.570
 they work well 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 but you can use classic glasses if 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.360
 you want 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 to make sure he does not fall 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.980
 and the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.130
 what you have to do 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.710
 and knot the end 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.710
 or two or three those that are necessary 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.070
 and the same does with the other side 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.530
 the phone system works from the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 next way and that is that when you speak 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.940
 on one side the voice follows the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.190
 vibration of the thread makes the thread vibrate and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.760
 that's what transfers the sound towards 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.760
 the other side 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.900
 interesting 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.840
 super easy to make 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.300
 children like it and you can also 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.070
 have the opportunity to work with 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.070
 making them decorate the glass 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.610
 another one of the secrets so that it works 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.310
 the phone is that you should keep in mind 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.540
 that the shorter the line the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.410
 thread that you put 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.240
 communication will be clearer and for 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.010
 so it works 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.160
 you have to have the extended ones 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.800
 totally 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.830
 that's how it looks now I'm going to show you how 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.830
 works
