00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hi everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.349
 make ketchup sauce at home 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.269
 therefore without crap in quotation marks 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 inside we will use only a little 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.220
 cane sugar 7 some spice and le 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.710
 I guarantee a proper sauce will come 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 like the one you buy very good 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.180
 also talking is very simple I do 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 see the ingredients immediately 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 we will bring these fresh tomatoes 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.110
 it's about 2 kg then we'll need to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 two tablespoons of brown sugar a little 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.930
 some salt from the factory some grass 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 aromatic a little pepper an onion and 2 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 spoons of vinegar and let's start 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 first we are going to prepare the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 tomato puree 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.640
 I have as I said part from tomatoes 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.309
 fresh inter but we can not have 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 time you can pass very well to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 tomato puree break this way 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.570
 tomatoes very coarsely and there 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 we put in the car 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.479
 ok i have been waiting for engines now 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.479
 we can put the spring onion 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 ok now let's put on the covered fire a 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.450
 slightly low so that the sauce a little 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 for good once your sauce 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.410
 will be ready you will have to go through this 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200
 green-green through a sieve in order to remove 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.510
 the seeds and the kennel at that point the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.670
 you can again put on the fire and do 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.640
 evaporate excess water what 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 it will turn out to be the classic pass of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.400
 tomatoes will come from 2 kg of tomatoes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.110
 about 300 grams of past but this is 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.690
 indicative for it then depends on como 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.940
 black used is more or less in agreement 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.040
 so as I said at the beginning of the video 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.380
 if you want to start planet mind 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.400
 you will have to weigh about the past 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.510
 100 grams now we put it in one 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:15.590
 pan with the g now add two 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:18.850
 spoons of brown sugar and two 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.850
 spoons of apple vinegar 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.280
 we also put salt 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.690
 and we can put on the fire after 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.659
 put sugar salt vinegar we do 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.790
 tighten on the heat for about 10 minutes 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.310
 I also suggest you maybe cover it 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.250
 to issue field as we did the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.250
 wise before we now put the spices 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.120
 then see 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.260
 I try to put only these three 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.810
 aromas herbs and public fears though 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.020
 that many aspects are too classic 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.030
 inside like ginger the games of carnation 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.280
 nutmeg you put what you 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.760
 the more you like it 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.590
 ok now let's put on the fire again 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.590
 few minutes that maybe it was property 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.150
 we are pouring our leap into one 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.040
 bowl or if you want to keep it 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.490
 the mind of a bottle and then the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.490
 first as we will use immediately 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.560
 you have have it directly in a bowl 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.660
 here our calcium sauce is ready 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.610
 like me there is very easy and also 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.070
 quick to do everything you can leave 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.050
 directly from tomato puree e 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.360
 was shortened by so many times 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.420
 it will take so few minutes 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 I wanted to say about that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.010
 this sauce is very rich in lycopene 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.690
 deeds you must know that lycopene is 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.110
 easily absorbable ours 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.990
 organism only if the tomato is processed 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.609
 at high temperatures then 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.500
 paradoxically all the passes 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.630
 also ketchup and they are much more 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.910
 greet in moto2 rich in lycopene of 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.190
 fresh tomato this way than of 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.260
 made in his good and healthy life for 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
 all your children now 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.640
 eat corner and chips with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.460
 hamburgers and the recipe also of the 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.419
 sudden aspects really made one 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.100
 nice surprise 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.110
 I hope the life recipe 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.810

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.810
