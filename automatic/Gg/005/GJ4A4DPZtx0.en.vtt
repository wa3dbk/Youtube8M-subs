00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 at this moment there are very good pears already 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 of the autumn season have to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 choose those that are firm and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.370
 preferably not too big like that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 are the ones that at this moment we can 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:20.630
 find the pele the buoy hollow out the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 part below I leave the little 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:34.239
 and I'm going to put it to cook in water 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.239
 with a touch of vanilla or a twig 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.629
 of vanilla and so we put it in a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 pan I say this way with other 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.930
 batteries thinly removing the skin 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 and we can make about six piles 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.149
 with water 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 and in the end we are going to add the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.100
 sweetener that you have wanted 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.500
 choosing is a noble fruit 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.520
 that at this moment is at its best 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 seasoning what one could call pears 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 of autumn 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.990
 here we have hollowed and peeled 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 I add water I take them to cooking and when 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 when pricking it is tender but not 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.660
 too much that is firm but cooked 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.850
 retirement and the Greek the sweetener that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.500
 you want if you did not put the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.550
 vanilla twig a few drops of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.980
 vanilla which is a simple dessert 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.770
 low calories and with fruits of the 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.380
 station and here is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.380
 the cooked pear finished 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.840
 and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.990
 very rich indeed very tempting to 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.880
 serve cold or at natural temperature 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.880
 until next time and thanks
