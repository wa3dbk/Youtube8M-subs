00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.650
 and hello everyone as well for pc mac is a fortress against m 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.189
 but today I will introduce my macbook white 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.189
 I bought about a month ago 4 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.190
 and here we are again likely to sell a macbook white 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.220
 donkalor quick presentation of examples of age because even you had to 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.940
 see hundreds on the internet unpacking 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.930
 so this is not a live debate and already unpacked 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 it's been more than a month since I'm ready 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.870
 so I really wanted to test myself before I could 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 you make a little bit of breakage 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260
 So here is 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.950
 so it's still out 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.379
 it has all the latest technologies and there must of course 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.630
 this non-place by 10 points 6 points 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.550
 cathy I can not find 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 of course stop 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.150
 that's it for the very fast packing of Lombardy tower 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.260
 the content what interests us ap 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 so of course you mean it's not a live unpacking I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.720
 have already been used since publicly a month and a half pretty much I want 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.930
 to say I would say 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.050
 so at holland at the shop features like these we can notice that 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.330
 on the hood 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.160
 if I'm wrong about some models where some packaging via a 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.910
 black foam that came to encompass so that the interior to not that it 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.030
 move it has to be 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.510
 the missing so if a little more ecolo we will say that like that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 always of course the ease for the debate go with the little 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.870
 label the little tongue by vincent qc - a laurent son who 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.040
 Exceeds so I put it aside for the moment 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.530
 then the box contains a global management 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.549
 the paper has changed a little bit it is really very pleasant to the touch 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.930
 here is 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.860
 then we have the conviction that I just have the keyboard 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.089
 like every morning clinic present the eu anyway it's not going to change this 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.049
 which has not changed either 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.260
 that's what the little carousel inside three quarters perfect for 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.579
 a little bit of height 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.640
 here 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.669
 which includes the manual 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.299
 but these killer city sticker differences is dead from mac osx that 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.699
 the profession interview not the usb key 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.699
 as we can see on some clear matches and so on 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.429
 tactical 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.909
 so the mac ones that I myself came out which is here 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.769
 far from there in the stone taking but in flagrancy crisis 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.590
 being inside there is still the little one that I do not use the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.289
 all 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.269
 so that's why the box hortefeux to retire 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.589
 we can jump from macbook stages to itself 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.699
 so it has a lot more to me than what I can tell you so already 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.409
 I was very happy with this purchase 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.049
 simply because there the basis so the same taste that I had seen 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.000
 curious hudon that can be found almost everywhere 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.839
 today live 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:16.589
 in all except stores recalled except with two gigas of ram 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.609
 250 gigabytes of hard drive at 5400 rpm 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.869
 13 inch screen here is I can tell you about it 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.999
 I bought them so% 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.849
 989 euros if they will not vote a baker but I really was very 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.589
 very surprised because there is so the macbook had the gift that two gigas 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.299
 of ram I'm asking you do you speak 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.359
 he did not have it at all the words did the same 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.209
 of a sting the same price for this one has 4 gigas of ram 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.119
 so it really gets closer to a pro macbook 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.900
 it's the one that comes closest to a well understood 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.759
 good even if his name is not random 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.139
 so we can see the prices of the different prices so we have the max 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.400
 with the ethernet port with the mini displayport of high prices but the 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:58.299
 helmet track 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.120
 so these shapes are really very much like I think it's very very 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.759
 owl 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.899
 if formerly the old macbook with much more square shapes and I 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.999
 remember that some had problems 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.540
 at the level of the hull 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.469
 he was breaking in some places 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:16.620
 so that's when super drive back 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.579
 the bottom 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.930
 the bottom is very nice to the touch 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.669
 it is very easily removable that small lives are there alas 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.189
 but we have several that there is na 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.080
 so we have one of 3 88 years all because it's me 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.889
 very easy to disassemble and then everything is below to change the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.599
 hard disk and so on 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.080
 So here is 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.330
 now we are going to see the veil 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.999
 so of course 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.699
 a little pub blow hop 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.879
 it's that his fast 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.199
 so very very happy with this machine I really appreciate the fluid 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.669
 quick 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.840
 I can not fault the capacity of two hard drives for the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.509
 world suits us since I have an external hard drive from bakara 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.139
 of course for all music videos movies and so on 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.120
 the trackpad so you see here is really very very very very very 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.710
 nice very easy to use 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.089
 really 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.399
 it's really a marvel if you ever do with three with four fingers 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:18.959
 sorry the decent pop-up window deceptively decent of December let's take 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.499
 three is pretty 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.740
 special rate but 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.760
 for example to return we do a search is simple 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.610
 on Google 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.999
 that's it for you we're going to go on 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.150
 Youtube 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.050
 me there 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.009
 so if we go on youtube for example p 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.439
 we will go click on it of course 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.080
 so that's our search for the tulle so to simply go back 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.570
 you need three fingers 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.689
 with three fingers makes you a little moment from right to left 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.020
 and voronin back and so on 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.020
 it's really very nice to use and it's great owl 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.659
 so that's what else can I tell you about that so I 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.629
 will show you 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.190
 we will do a small zoom so here are the performances of moman so to various 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.229
 in d2 r3 of course 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.550
 as I wanted to say unless some interventions taken over there are 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.119
 So a wealth of ideas under a mac osx 10 points 6 points 5 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.069
 the update came out not very long ago on Thursday and that has 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.240
 due three days 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.619
 barely 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:29.449
 so the software provided so basic with at home we have 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.449
 so not an hour of a sport of mails 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.750
 in his family - will finish narration 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.530
 we mean firefox beta which must pay attention to points 7 as soon as 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.439
 I'm not wrong in some cheat 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.909
 karine abba stars this ipad late so preview of itunes dany you say 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.110
 photo sports press laurent carnol photo to see our video 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.050
 I'm coming 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.899
 of course put aperture 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.649
 that I find much better 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:57.399
 haimoudi for the photos for video montages so part on which he 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.249
 will realize this podcast 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:01.410
 so not a machine for backups 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.520
 the system my printer another very fast photo editing software 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.029
 following or order 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.800
 the suite office and patron photoshop 39 elements 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:15.449
 strange of the pro SLR who is really very nice for the photos and cutaneous 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.449
 so here to tell what I can tell you about this little mac 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.169
 really very very happy I tell you is really getting closer to the balls 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.009
 macbook pro for me ii 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.120
 it's one of those closest to this I hope everything can be 

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:34.270
 a plus if ever there is any to say that I did wrong that I mis explained 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.009
 that you want me to come back on 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.710
 do not hesitate to tell me this is my first man no break so for 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.819
 improve as time goes by 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:45.499
 So here I wish you all a good end of the day shapiro
