hey<00:00:04.730> everybody<00:00:05.090> I'm<00:00:05.210> Jamie<00:00:05.450> province<00:00:05.990> and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey everybody I'm Jamie province and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.420 
hey everybody I'm Jamie province and
today<00:00:06.560> I'm<00:00:06.620> going<00:00:06.740> to<00:00:06.800> show<00:00:06.980> you<00:00:07.040> a<00:00:07.160> technique

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
today I'm going to show you a technique

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.700 
today I'm going to show you a technique
for<00:00:07.700> a<00:00:07.940> different<00:00:08.540> kind<00:00:08.780> of<00:00:08.900> cheeseburger<00:00:09.500> I

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
for a different kind of cheeseburger I

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.950 
for a different kind of cheeseburger I
call<00:00:09.950> it<00:00:10.070> the<00:00:10.160> outside-in<00:00:11.030> cheeseburger

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
call it the outside-in cheeseburger

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980 
call it the outside-in cheeseburger
because<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.440> cheese<00:00:12.710> is<00:00:13.040> inside<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:14.690> idea

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
because the cheese is inside the idea

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.050 
because the cheese is inside the idea
came<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.260> me<00:00:15.530> from<00:00:15.860> a<00:00:15.920> restaurant<00:00:16.490> in<00:00:16.610> New<00:00:16.730> York

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
came to me from a restaurant in New York

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.970 
came to me from a restaurant in New York
when<00:00:17.180> I<00:00:17.210> was<00:00:17.300> a<00:00:17.450> kid<00:00:17.689> growing<00:00:17.990> up<00:00:18.110> outside<00:00:18.710> of

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
when I was a kid growing up outside of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.019 
when I was a kid growing up outside of
New<00:00:19.160> York<00:00:19.220> there<00:00:19.550> was<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:19.700> famous

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
New York there was this famous

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.970 
New York there was this famous
restaurant<00:00:20.689> they<00:00:20.869> had<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.169> most<00:00:21.410> delicious

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
restaurant they had the most delicious

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.640 
restaurant they had the most delicious
juiciest<00:00:22.550> burger<00:00:22.910> imaginable<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.439> turns

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
juiciest burger imaginable and it turns

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.519 
juiciest burger imaginable and it turns
out<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.099> reason<00:00:25.579> is<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:26.239> they<00:00:26.750> put<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:26.989> pad<00:00:27.320> of

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
out the reason is that they put a pad of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.560 
out the reason is that they put a pad of
butter<00:00:27.800> in<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.520> middle<00:00:28.669> of<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.000> burger<00:00:29.360> and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
butter in the middle of the burger and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.720 
butter in the middle of the burger and
as<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:29.869> cooked<00:00:30.200> the<00:00:30.680> butter<00:00:30.919> would<00:00:31.099> melt<00:00:31.369> and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
as it cooked the butter would melt and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.030 
as it cooked the butter would melt and
it<00:00:32.029> would<00:00:32.149> create<00:00:32.480> this<00:00:32.689> ultimate<00:00:33.350> burger<00:00:33.590> so

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
it would create this ultimate burger so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.130 
it would create this ultimate burger so
instead<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.820> using<00:00:35.000> butter<00:00:35.360> I'm<00:00:35.660> gonna<00:00:35.870> use

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
instead of using butter I'm gonna use

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.920 
instead of using butter I'm gonna use
some<00:00:36.500> brie<00:00:36.860> cheese<00:00:37.480> I'll<00:00:38.480> show<00:00:38.630> you<00:00:38.720> how<00:00:38.840> it

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
works but first let me consider the meat

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.200

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
itself ground chuck is my preferred meat

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.720 
itself ground chuck is my preferred meat
for<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.600> burger<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:46.160> give<00:00:46.310> it<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.520> little

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
bind it all together a little bit of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.510 
bind it all together a little bit of
breadcrumb<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:55.070> course<00:00:55.280> we've<00:00:55.400> got<00:00:55.430> to

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
breadcrumb and of course we've got to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.770 
breadcrumb and of course we've got to
season<00:00:55.790> it<00:00:55.970> up<00:00:56.120> with<00:00:56.270> some<00:00:56.450> salt<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.780> pepper

breeze seeping out the side and creating

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.809 
breeze seeping out the side and creating
a<00:01:23.630> mess<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.200> grill<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:24.679> get<00:01:25.429> yourself

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
a mess on the grill so get yourself

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.999 
a mess on the grill so get yourself
about<00:01:26.030> us<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.389> six<00:01:26.810> ounce<00:01:27.020> size<00:01:27.380> burger<00:01:28.060> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
just create a little well a little

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.849 
just create a little well a little
indentation<00:01:33.859> right<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> middle<00:01:36.049> but

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
indentation right in the middle but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.800 
indentation right in the middle but
don't<00:01:37.189> go<00:01:37.399> all<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.759> way<00:01:37.909> down<00:01:38.209> don't<00:01:38.569> go<00:01:38.749> to

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
don't go all the way down don't go to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.800 
don't go all the way down don't go to
the<00:01:39.079> bottom<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.249> burger<00:01:40.609> just<00:01:41.329> about<00:01:41.539> that

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the bottom of the burger just about that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.550 
the bottom of the burger just about that
and<00:01:42.789> don't<00:01:43.789> use<00:01:44.030> too<00:01:44.509> much<00:01:44.539> cheese<00:01:45.229> that's

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and don't use too much cheese that's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.959 
and don't use too much cheese that's
another<00:01:45.829> problem<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:46.429> you<00:01:46.549> have<00:01:46.639> too<00:01:46.819> much

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
another problem if you have too much

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.129 
another problem if you have too much
cheese<00:01:47.270> that's<00:01:47.450> gonna<00:01:47.630> melt<00:01:47.929> right<00:01:48.079> through

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
cheese that's gonna melt right through

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.090 
cheese that's gonna melt right through
so<00:01:48.979> just<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.279> knob<00:01:49.490> about<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.090> big<00:01:50.950> okay<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
so just a knob about this big okay and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.800 
so just a knob about this big okay and
I've<00:01:52.189> taken<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.520> rind<00:01:52.850> off<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.359> that<00:01:53.569> just

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
I've taken the rind off of that just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.389 
I've taken the rind off of that just
because<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.079> find<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.499> it<00:01:54.679> tastes<00:01:55.219> better

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
because I find that it tastes better

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.489 
because I find that it tastes better
this<00:01:55.700> way<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.149> melts<00:01:56.420> better<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.899> then<00:01:57.439> I'm

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499
