352 for that purpose and then I got a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.770 
352 for that purpose and then I got a
few<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.250> self<00:00:35.489> American<00:00:36.000> players<00:00:36.270> into

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
players so that would kind of make up

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
players so that would kind of make up
our<00:00:41.190> squat<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> farm<00:00:41.850> player<00:00:42.059> would<00:00:42.270> be

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just to kind of show you that this was

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
just to kind of show you that this was
my<00:00:56.489> best<00:00:56.730> chance<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> half<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:58.050> much

my best chance of the half not much

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
my best chance of the half not much
stuff<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.219> kept<00:00:59.489> him<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.730> completely

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
stuff going on I kept him at completely

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.549 
stuff going on I kept him at completely
away<00:01:00.359> from<00:01:00.390> chances<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.199> didn't<00:01:01.440> really

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
away from chances but I didn't really

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.789 
away from chances but I didn't really
create<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> most<00:01:02.250> interesting<00:01:02.910> stuff<00:01:03.149> myself

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
create the most interesting stuff myself

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
create the most interesting stuff myself
but<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> change<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
but that was going to change in the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
but that was going to change in the
second<00:01:07.080> half<00:01:07.290> he<00:01:07.500> kicks<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.010> Sekou<00:01:08.760> picks

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.790 
got a shot in around the 29th minute but
that<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.209> not<00:03:48.420> really<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> best<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.320> chances

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
that was not really the best of chances

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800 
that was not really the best of chances
and<00:03:49.890> instead<00:03:50.310> he<00:03:50.820> could<00:03:51.030> play<00:03:51.120> football<00:03:51.660> too
