I've been getting a lot of questions

concerning<00:00:10.090> the<00:00:10.330> flow

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 
concerning the flow

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.900

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
oil and gold that I think need to be

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.330 
oil and gold that I think need to be
addressed<00:00:13.560> many<00:00:14.560> seem<00:00:14.860> to<00:00:14.980> be<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.220> opinion

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
addressed many seem to be of the opinion

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.730 
addressed many seem to be of the opinion
that<00:00:15.790> gold<00:00:16.180> is<00:00:16.390> either<00:00:16.600> an<00:00:16.869> Armageddon<00:00:17.530> type

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
that gold is either an Armageddon type

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.160 
that gold is either an Armageddon type
of<00:00:17.890> investment<00:00:18.430> or<00:00:18.880> that<00:00:19.450> it<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.720> going<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:20.140> be

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
of investment or that it is going to be

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.170

used<00:00:20.439> in<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.680> future<00:00:21.040> by<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.250> power<00:00:21.490> elite<00:00:21.970> to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
used in the future by the power elite to

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.450 
used in the future by the power elite to
control<00:00:22.510> the<00:00:22.630> masses<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:23.310> think<00:00:24.310> there<00:00:24.430> is

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
control the masses I think there is

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.370 
control the masses I think there is
another<00:00:24.730> alternative<00:00:24.849> that<00:00:25.720> many<00:00:25.960> people

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
another alternative that many people

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.470 
another alternative that many people
aren't<00:00:26.560> considering<00:00:27.040> this<00:00:27.910> is<00:00:28.090> one<00:00:28.240> that<00:00:28.419> I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
aren't considering this is one that I

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.229 
aren't considering this is one that I
alluded<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.960> in<00:00:29.230> my<00:00:29.349> last<00:00:29.560> video<00:00:29.800> but<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:30.939> don't
