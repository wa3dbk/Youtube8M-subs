but that's just the storm we've observed
that<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.970> key<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.270> success<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.899> that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that the key to success is that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.710 
that the key to success is that

endurance factor we've had probably you
know<00:00:59.750> maybe<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.110> dozen<00:01:00.380> parents<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:00.980> stopped

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
after two or three months that's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.259 
after two or three months that's
interesting<00:01:04.219> that<00:01:04.250> since<00:01:04.579> this<00:01:04.759> information

Russia and in Mexico and they've all had
some<00:01:29.479> improvement<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.079> then<00:01:30.200> they<00:01:30.319> regress

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
some improvement but then they regress

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.010 
some improvement but then they regress
and<00:01:31.149> then<00:01:32.149> they<00:01:32.270> come<00:01:32.299> in<00:01:32.569> through<00:01:32.719> our<00:01:32.749> kind

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
and then they come in through our kind

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.440 
and then they come in through our kind
can<00:01:33.170> go<00:01:33.289> through<00:01:33.529> and<00:01:33.679> there's<00:01:33.979> no<00:01:34.099> regression

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
can go through and there's no regression

house is on fire are you going to bring
in<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.509> new<00:01:41.630> carpet<00:01:42.079> in<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.229> new<00:01:42.380> roof<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.799> think

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
in a new carpet in a new roof I think

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.830 
in a new carpet in a new roof I think
it'd<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:43.729> better<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.060> put<00:01:44.179> out<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.359> fire<00:01:44.539> first

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
it'd be better to put out the fire first

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.190 
it'd be better to put out the fire first
don't<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.109> think<00:01:45.429> then<00:01:46.429> you<00:01:46.579> repair<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:46.999> and

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
don't you think then you repair it and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.480 
don't you think then you repair it and
that's<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.380> we're<00:01:48.499> doing<00:01:48.709> we're<00:01:49.219> actually

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
that's what we're doing we're actually

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.480 
that's what we're doing we're actually
putting<00:01:50.389> out<00:01:50.599> the<00:01:50.749> fire<00:01:50.959> first<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.619> then

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
putting out the fire first and then

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.980 
putting out the fire first and then
these<00:01:52.639> repair<00:01:52.999> mechanisms<00:01:53.479> work<00:01:53.749> and<00:01:53.899> when

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
these repair mechanisms work and when

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.940 
these repair mechanisms work and when
people<00:01:54.139> ask<00:01:54.439> them<00:01:54.590> what<00:01:54.679> do<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.799> think<00:01:54.919> about

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
people ask them what do you think about

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.289 
people ask them what do you think about
hyper<00:01:55.219> breaks<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.490> said<00:01:55.639> I<00:01:55.669> think<00:01:55.819> it's<00:01:56.060> great

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
hyper breaks I said I think it's great

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.010 
hyper breaks I said I think it's great
but<00:01:57.130> wait<00:01:58.130> first<00:01:58.520> clean<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.270> system<00:01:59.719> up<00:01:59.840> and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
but wait first clean the system up and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.679 
but wait first clean the system up and
then<00:02:00.200> start<00:02:00.499> in<00:02:00.619> six<00:02:00.829> months<00:02:01.099> and<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:02.389> people

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
then start in six months and the people

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.379 
then start in six months and the people
that<00:02:02.779> have<00:02:02.869> been<00:02:02.959> doing<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.349> about<00:02:04.389> probably

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
that have been doing that about probably

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.659 
that have been doing that about probably
15<00:02:06.109> of<00:02:06.499> them<00:02:06.649> at<00:02:06.799> this<00:02:06.950> point<00:02:07.219> that<00:02:07.369> are<00:02:07.549> at

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:07.669 
15 of them at this point that are at

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.419 
15 of them at this point that are at
that<00:02:07.819> point<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.649> brought<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.770> up<00:02:09.830> okay<00:02:10.069> we<00:02:10.160> spend

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
that point I brought it up okay we spend

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.860 
that point I brought it up okay we spend
about<00:02:10.489> six<00:02:10.729> months<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.180> child's<00:02:11.480> doing<00:02:11.690> so

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
about six months in a child's doing so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.480 
about six months in a child's doing so
much<00:02:11.959> better<00:02:12.020> now<00:02:12.410> talking<00:02:12.860> anything<00:02:13.280> now<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
much better now talking anything now you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.650 
much better now talking anything now you
might<00:02:13.640> want<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.820> consider<00:02:13.970> hyperbarics<00:02:14.510> and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
might want to consider hyperbarics and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.090 
might want to consider hyperbarics and
you<00:02:14.720> know<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.930> answer<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> get<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.410> why

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
you know what the answer I get is why

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.830 
you know what the answer I get is why
you're<00:02:16.820> getting<00:02:17.030> better<00:02:17.180> they<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:17.480> need<00:02:17.570> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
you're getting better they don't need it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.809 
you're getting better they don't need it
but<00:02:18.560> we're<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:18.920> getting<00:02:19.250> rid<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.459> spark

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
but we're just getting rid of the spark

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.250 
but we're just getting rid of the spark
if<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.120> get<00:02:20.239> rid<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.569> part<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
if you get rid of this part the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
if you get rid of this part the
pollution<00:02:21.680> system<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.220> public<00:02:22.489> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
pollution system in the public you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.839 
pollution system in the public you
basically<00:02:23.510> d<00:02:23.750> polluting<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> body<00:02:24.819> but<00:02:25.819> I

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
basically d polluting the body but I

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.610 
basically d polluting the body but I
think<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.269> for<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> older<00:02:26.840> kids<00:02:26.870> because

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
think that for the older kids because

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.880 
think that for the older kids because
our<00:02:27.739> success<00:02:28.190> has<00:02:28.629> been<00:02:29.629> all<00:02:30.230> under<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.769> age

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
our success has been all under the age

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.600 
our success has been all under the age
of<00:02:31.099> 99<00:02:31.580> or<00:02:31.910> under<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.930> since<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:33.610> because

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
of 99 or under now since then because

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.520 
of 99 or under now since then because
when<00:02:34.970> i<00:02:35.000> presented<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.629> Congress<00:02:36.019> i<00:02:36.140> told<00:02:36.410> them

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
when i presented to Congress i told them

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.380 
when i presented to Congress i told them
that<00:02:36.769> are<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.489> didn't<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.150> would<00:02:38.330> be

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
that are I didn't think this would be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.670 
that are I didn't think this would be
effective<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:38.930> older<00:02:39.200> children<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
effective for older children because the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.930 
effective for older children because the
older<00:02:39.860> children<00:02:40.099> I'd<00:02:40.190> use<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.640> didn't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
older children I'd use it and I didn't

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.759 
older children I'd use it and I didn't
see<00:02:41.120> when<00:02:41.660> they<00:02:41.750> got<00:02:41.870> better<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.349> started

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
see when they got better they started

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.860 
see when they got better they started
talking<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.940> know<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:44.269> was<00:02:44.360> but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
talking and you know there was but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.420 
talking and you know there was but
they'll<00:02:44.989> never<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.620> they<00:02:45.769> won't<00:02:45.890> be<00:02:46.160> there

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
they'll never that they won't be there

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580 
they'll never that they won't be there
not<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.760> my<00:02:47.030> book<00:02:47.660> considered<00:02:48.080> normal<00:02:48.319> they'll

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
not in my book considered normal they'll

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.589 
not in my book considered normal they'll
they<00:02:49.310> can<00:02:49.459> read<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:49.880> they'll<00:02:50.030> never<00:02:50.209> do<00:02:50.420> much

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
they can read but they'll never do much

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.330 
they can read but they'll never do much
more<00:02:50.780> than<00:02:50.840> flip<00:02:51.319> hamburgers<00:02:51.560> for<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.069> living

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
more than flip hamburgers for a living

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.789 
more than flip hamburgers for a living
that<00:02:52.489> type<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.760> thing<00:02:53.030> they<00:02:54.019> won't<00:02:54.620> reach

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
that type of thing they won't reach

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.650 
that type of thing they won't reach
their<00:02:54.980> full<00:02:55.190> potential<00:02:55.549> but<00:02:56.000> now<00:02:56.239> I'm<00:02:56.390> finding

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
their full potential but now I'm finding

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.690 
their full potential but now I'm finding
that<00:02:56.810> actually<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.709> have<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> couple<00:02:58.250> kids<00:02:58.430> I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
that actually we have a couple kids I

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.220 
that actually we have a couple kids I
have<00:02:59.060> three<00:02:59.269> kids<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.599> are<00:02:59.690> over<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.019> age<00:03:00.049> of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
have three kids that are over the age of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.869 
have three kids that are over the age of
11<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.950> they're<00:03:03.950> all<00:03:04.099> having<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.489> rapid

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
11 and they're all having a rapid

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.250 
11 and they're all having a rapid
response<00:03:05.030> actually<00:03:05.360> they're<00:03:05.599> all<00:03:05.690> children

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
response actually they're all children

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.690 
response actually they're all children
of<00:03:06.349> doctors<00:03:06.739> but<00:03:06.769> they're<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:07.519> having

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
of doctors but they're all having

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
we've actually had won 34 year old that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.509 
we've actually had won 34 year old that

improvements in his cognition after

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.910 
improvements in his cognition after

brain starts to recover you know you're
it's<00:03:24.170> kind<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:24.440> when<00:03:24.560> you're<00:03:24.680> putting

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
it's kind of like when you're putting

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.770 
it's kind of like when you're putting
out<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> fire<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:26.239> know<00:03:26.329> when<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.480> put<00:03:26.600> down<00:03:26.660> to

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
out a fire you know when you put down to

out a fire you know when you put down to
fire<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.079> flames<00:03:27.260> start<00:03:27.560> leaping<00:03:27.859> up<00:03:27.950> higher

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
fire the flames start leaping up higher

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.009 
fire the flames start leaping up higher
it's<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.549> same<00:03:28.760> thing<00:03:28.790> well<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.720> can<00:03:29.840> you're

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it's the same thing well you can you're

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.360 
it's the same thing well you can you're
not<00:03:30.109> going<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.290> stand<00:03:30.410> back<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.739> we're<00:03:31.160> setting

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
not going to stand back so we're setting

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.710 
not going to stand back so we're setting
the<00:03:31.400> fires<00:03:31.639> leaving<00:03:31.970> hard<00:03:32.120> let<00:03:32.299> me<00:03:32.359> back<00:03:32.540> off

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the fires leaving hard let me back off

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.569 
the fires leaving hard let me back off
I'm<00:03:32.900> not<00:03:33.019> just<00:03:33.139> don't<00:03:33.260> watch<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.560> burn<00:03:33.709> I'm<00:03:34.459> if

I'm not just don't watch it burn I'm if
you<00:03:34.700> want<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.090> that's<00:03:35.299> fine<00:03:35.510> but<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you want to do that that's fine but the

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:36.940 
you want to do that that's fine but the
child's<00:03:36.290> are<00:03:36.380> going<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.560> get<00:03:36.650> better<00:03:36.769> you

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
child's are going to get better you

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.970 
child's are going to get better you
gotta<00:03:37.099> you<00:03:37.400> gotta<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.609> know<00:03:38.359> more

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
gotta you gotta you know more

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.690 
gotta you gotta you know more
aggressively<00:03:39.980> try<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.220> put<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.489> fire<00:03:40.670> out

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
aggressively try to put that fire out

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.660 
aggressively try to put that fire out
but<00:03:41.690> but<00:03:42.049> that's<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.560> storm<00:03:43.040> before<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.430> calm

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
but but that's the storm before the calm

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.460 
but but that's the storm before the calm
sets<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.359> that's<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.900> very<00:03:44.930> important

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
sets in and that's a very important

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.569 
sets in and that's a very important
thing<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:45.769> for<00:03:45.889> people<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.190> understand

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
thing I think for people to understand

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.180 
thing I think for people to understand
and<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:47.750> still<00:03:47.959> have<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.200> deal<00:03:48.859> with<00:03:49.010> some<00:03:49.160> of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
and you still have to deal with some of

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.229 
and you still have to deal with some of
these<00:03:49.280> other<00:03:49.489> issues<00:03:49.669> that<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.090> know<00:03:50.180> you

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
these other issues that you know you

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.390 
these other issues that you know you
need<00:03:51.079> minerals<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:51.739> important<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
need minerals is so important to do the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920 
need minerals is so important to do the
minerals<00:03:52.669> because<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.940> BMPs<00:03:53.389> is<00:03:53.569> going<00:03:53.780> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
minerals because the BMPs is going and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
minerals because the BMPs is going and
pulling<00:03:54.109> out<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.349> murky<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:54.709> it's<00:03:54.829> also

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
pulling out the murky but it's also

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.589 
pulling out the murky but it's also
pulling<00:03:55.190> out<00:03:55.310> other<00:03:55.459> things<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.389> we<00:03:56.510> have

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
pulling out other things and so we have

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.569 
pulling out other things and so we have
to<00:03:56.690> make<00:03:56.750> sure<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:57.019> replete<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:59.739> but<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.769> just<00:04:01.160> I

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
to make sure we replete it but I just I

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.039 
to make sure we replete it but I just I
just<00:04:01.730> find<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.450> most<00:04:02.630> important<00:04:03.019> thing

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
just find that the most important thing

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.059 
just find that the most important thing
is<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.290> get<00:04:03.380> rid<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.650> mercury<00:04:03.859> and

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
is you get rid of that mercury and

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.680 
is you get rid of that mercury and
everything<00:04:04.370> else<00:04:04.519> starts<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.180> fall<00:04:05.329> back<00:04:05.510> into

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
everything else starts to fall back into

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.750 
everything else starts to fall back into
place
