00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 coli who find today for a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.500
 new makeup tweet so that's okay 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.290
 to be a makeup in shades a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 little blue I think that really 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.699
 very very pretty for spring or 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 summer is really appropriate and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 you'll see it's an ultra michael 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 fast and ultra easy that takes even 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 not five minutes 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.519
 and if you're ever a beginner at 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 makeup or so if you do not have 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 very very comfortable it's a tutorial she 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 was for you so it's gone so 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 it's gone for eye makeup 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 you will see it's ultra simple ultra 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 quick 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.469
 so I already realized my time at 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 beforehand I made a video down a 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 special video on it so I'll you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 will put the link right here is also 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 in info bar for the one they 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 would have missed and I'm going to start with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.840
 apply a base elf and in fact it's 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 one of my favorite bases is the base to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 1 euros with the small foam tip 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 like that and frankly this base there 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 I have nothing to say about it 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 just awesome I applied on all my 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 eyelid I pimp a little bit of jeans 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 white that you can often wizard 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 it will help to unify my eyelid and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 then that will allow the lighthouses that I m 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.170
 after to hold soon all day 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.970
 you'll see come back take that two 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 colors of one and the same talent is 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.579
 so it'll be the w7 in the bear and I 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.490
 will start by taking the lighthouse sic 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.100
 which is a kind of light beige a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 flick the elysÃ©e jeans and deposited 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 tapping on all my mobile eyelid and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 the more I go back in a little bit 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 to bring light that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.119
 you will see how I tell you 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 it's a makeup that takes five 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.470
 minutes but frankly when he does 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.259
 the beautiful I find it really very very 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 pretty now i'm going to get myself 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.260
 take the color thunder which is a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.690
 Brown 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.020
 a little bit and reese and a pretty brown 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.840
 dark and I'm going to drop that in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.510
 my outer corner 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 and then here I am going to overflow a 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.190
 a little bit at my side 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 stone makes small movements 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:30.720
 circular like this here you see it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.790
 drop its color at my hollow 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.380
 eyelids and I will not go this bridge does 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 a little bit of everything for that little bit 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.870
 So the earliest after I file this 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.950
 the color roughly enough I'm 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.370
 do not take too much head 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.550
 I will come dimmed just after 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.709
 so it's not ultra precious very 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.230
 accurate but I want to come football and the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.730
 everything after so now once that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 I'm at this stage I want to come 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.800
 take a brush fades hours a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.430
 paintbrush foot we think mode and engraver 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.030
 call it what you want and here I am 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.459
 will come 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.739
 is this telly TV to have a 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.500
 result a little more melted and a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.010
 little bit sweeter 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.530
 so I go quietly after that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.300
 no need to be ultra ultra precise 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.300
 since the makeup will stop here 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.320
 and I look to you on the other side 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360
 so there I do not know if you see but 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.550
 I have a small trace at my level 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.989
 inner corner here in the eye it's not 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.980
 a trace of eyeshadows or it's 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.130
 not a basic trace 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.610
 in fact I have a little bobo in the eye 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:43.080
 so it happens it does not hurt but 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.760
 it's a little bobo so I had to 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.850
 lighthouse and base going on in 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 but unfortunately I can not do anything 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.410
 to do but it shows that when I have them 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.180
 eyes closed so that's what it gives 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.220
 once it is well dimmed we will 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.770
 there is no need to be a trap 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.080
 Salesman 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.690
 He is to be an ace in makeup she 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.640
 since learns well football and football 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.950
 dimmed so the result is a lot 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.880
 more melted and there is not any of 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.550
 disaster 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.090
 now i'm going to come and apply a 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.680
 scream or blue so here this one it's a 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.480
 that I bought in England for a 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.270
 or two pounds maximum is the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.250
 make up academy brand 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.890
 I do not know if you can find it in 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.940
 France but here you go take the 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.460
 brand of your choice 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.480
 and in fact it's a blue puts a blue 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.190
 too pretty a blue king a dream the king and 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.530
 you will see in summer on the eyes 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.610
 brown it's just undergone so is there this 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.060
 what I want to do is I'm coming 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.550
 draw a small line with my pencil 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.840
 so it does not need to be very precise 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.420
 I draw a little bit my 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.750
 eyelid to help me so I have a 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.330
 trace very small strokes and then 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.340
 would have faded everything but by cons 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.870
 the pencil it can be a I do not stop 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.210
 to say it but it can be a good one 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.640
 compromise for people who 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.080
 do not arrive with the liner in fact for 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.510
 it's still a lot more practical 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.310
 so once my pencil and 3 and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.290
 again I did not put 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.620
 perfectly and I will come now 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.170
 faded with a small brush a year 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.600
 small flat brush like that is the game 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.530
 and let smiles once again 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.250
 and blur everything here and blow fellin 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.750
 to those big enough showy but if you 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.270
 want it to be finer goes all 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.270
 just did a very little bit 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.250
 thinner with a brush to fade 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.250
 a little bit more thin too 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.370
 and suddenly I chose to do a 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.199
 eye by an eye for the pencil because 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.449
 they dry quickly enough and that's 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.860
 a lot easier to blur it out when 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.419
 it is still quite creamy so 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.340
 would come on the other side right after 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.430
 no I take back my little blue pencil and 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:14.979
 this time come to apply it in the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.000
 mucosa so there I have not bad and if 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.460
 never overflows 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.199
 at the level of the lash line and 20 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:26.349
 it's so much better because we 're coming 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:28.300
 again blurred everything he had to 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:31.960
 blow must really well faded that 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.520
 it is well blurred well smoking that's it 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.340
 will be much prettier than a big one 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.009
 line like that in the lining my corner 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.560
 but hey it's really a step 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:46.479
 ultra simple once it's done 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.219
 is not obliged me I like I 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.439
 I'm going to add a little bit of makeup 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:52.509
 black still have the same who is in 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.940
 the pallet doubles the test and I'm going 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:58.090
 just come in and put a little bit 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.310
 at the level of mourad movie is just in 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.259
 the outer corner to intensify a 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:07.659
 little bit more my look and like 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.889
 stopover rejuvenate applying the jo 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:14.169
 ikonik power girl is actually the brush 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.150
 it is curved to see more 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.469
 curled them up if they hold them the 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.569
 curvature all day 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.159
 she gives the length is a small 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:24.569
 little volume is this a mascara that 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:24.569
 I like a lot 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:32.020
 you see for now the result in 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.020
 a single layer benefri race 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.730
 here are the girls we kill everything is over 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.890
