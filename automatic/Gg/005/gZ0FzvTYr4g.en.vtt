resulted from one of those series it's
actually<00:05:13.870> not<00:05:14.800> any<00:05:15.610> good<00:05:16.000> figure<00:05:16.570> at<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
actually not any good figure at all the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.400 
actually not any good figure at all the
only<00:05:17.950> thing<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.310> would<00:05:18.550> say<00:05:19.050> that's<00:05:20.050> any<00:05:20.320> good

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
only thing I would say that's any good

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.200 
only thing I would say that's any good
about<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.520> figure<00:05:21.790> does<00:05:21.940> have<00:05:22.180> a

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
about it and the figure does have a

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.840 
about it and the figure does have a
really<00:05:22.720> good<00:05:22.900> surface<00:05:23.590> texture<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:26.850> even

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
really good surface texture but even

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.279 
really good surface texture but even
though<00:05:28.030> Steg<00:05:28.390> ron<00:05:28.539> has<00:05:28.690> only<00:05:28.840> really<00:05:29.110> had<00:05:29.260> a

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
though Steg ron has only really had a

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.830 
though Steg ron has only really had a
handful<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:29.890> appearances<00:05:30.479> somehow<00:05:31.479> this

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
handful of appearances somehow this

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.900 
handful of appearances somehow this
figure<00:05:32.850> doesn't<00:05:33.850> look<00:05:34.060> like<00:05:34.830> any<00:05:35.830> of<00:05:36.070> them<00:05:36.400> how

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
figure doesn't look like any of them how

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.779 
figure doesn't look like any of them how
any<00:05:37.270> artists<00:05:37.780> ever<00:05:37.990> drew<00:05:38.700> stag<00:05:39.700> Ron<00:05:41.610> it's<00:05:42.610> just

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
any artists ever drew stag Ron it's just

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.270 
any artists ever drew stag Ron it's just
a<00:05:42.850> pretty<00:05:43.060> kind<00:05:43.300> of<00:05:43.479> lifeless<00:05:44.470> figure<00:05:44.919> really
