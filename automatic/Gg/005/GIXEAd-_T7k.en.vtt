after<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> first<00:01:50.790> watched<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.390> braiding<00:01:52.049> them

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
after I first watched it braiding them

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.539 
after I first watched it braiding them
banding<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.880> think<00:01:54.079> when<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> braid<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> band<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
banding I think when I braid and band it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
banding I think when I braid and band it
and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.850> wash<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.710> longer

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and I wash it it's a little bit longer

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
and I wash it it's a little bit longer
like<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> process<00:02:00.210> stretches<00:02:00.899> them<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.229> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like that process stretches them out so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
like that process stretches them out so
I'm<00:02:01.860> gonna<00:02:02.100> give<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.000> sort<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.689> visual

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
I'm gonna give you a sort of visual

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.290 
I'm gonna give you a sort of visual
update<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.920> locs<00:02:05.159> until<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
update on my locs until you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.090 
update on my locs until you
it's<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.570> issues<00:02:07.200> necessarily<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> things

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
it's not issues necessarily the things

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.590 
it's not issues necessarily the things
that<00:02:08.190> I've<00:02:08.310> noticed<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.820> my<00:02:08.880> locks<00:02:09.240> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
that I've noticed with my locks and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.820 
that I've noticed with my locks and
things<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.110> could<00:02:10.290> potentially<00:02:10.410> become

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
things that could potentially become

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.130 
things that could potentially become
issues<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.940> parting<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.780> still

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
issues with them the parting is still

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.050 
issues with them the parting is still
going<00:02:13.890> strong<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:20.060> they're

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
going strong as you can see they're

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.990 
going strong as you can see they're
still<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.540> there<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:24.590> because<00:02:25.590> my<00:02:26.280> eggs<00:02:26.610> are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
still in there but because my eggs are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.400 
still in there but because my eggs are
loose<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.950> curly<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.720> those<00:02:30.720> are

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
loose and curly you can see those are

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.840 
loose and curly you can see those are
what<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.620> Luck's<00:02:31.830> look<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.160> try<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.700> use<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
what my Luck's look like try and use a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.220 
what my Luck's look like try and use a
piece<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.240> white<00:02:33.330> paper<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.840> behind<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
piece of white paper to get behind a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.310 
piece of white paper to get behind a
white<00:02:34.380> background<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.480> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
white background but as you can see the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.030 
white background but as you can see the
lock<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.740> slender<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.270> base<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.040> then

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
lock is slender at the base and then

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.690 
lock is slender at the base and then
kind<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.910> thick<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.170> top<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.890> that's<00:02:44.460> my

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
kind of thick at the top and that's my

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
kind of thick at the top and that's my
curl<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.450> them<00:02:45.570> are<00:02:45.720> are<00:02:45.930> worse<00:02:46.260> than

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
curl some of them are are worse than

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.760 
curl some of them are are worse than
others<00:02:47.360> let<00:02:48.360> me<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:49.230> doesn't<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.620> look

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
others let me see it doesn't really look

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.730 
others let me see it doesn't really look
that<00:02:49.950> bad<00:02:50.010> on<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> white<00:02:50.670> paper<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:53.660> mmm

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
that bad on the white paper of it mmm

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.400 
that bad on the white paper of it mmm
okay<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:56.160> my<00:02:56.310> issue<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
okay so what my issue is is that the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.330 
okay so what my issue is is that the
ends<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> are<00:02:59.400> quite<00:02:59.730> thick<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:01.170> I'm

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
ends that are quite thick when I'm

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.440 
ends that are quite thick when I'm
retightening<00:03:02.340> pulling<00:03:02.910> them<00:03:03.120> through<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
retightening pulling them through the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.020 
retightening pulling them through the
really<00:03:03.720> thin<00:03:04.170> base<00:03:04.500> I've<00:03:04.830> lost<00:03:05.550> some<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:05.910> my

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
really thin base I've lost some of my

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.080 
really thin base I've lost some of my
buds<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.840> they<00:03:07.350> actually<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.070> come<00:03:08.400> off<00:03:08.700> and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
buds and they actually just come off and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.760 
buds and they actually just come off and
I<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.230> will<00:03:10.350> happen<00:03:10.500> with

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
I don't think that will happen with

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.440 
I don't think that will happen with
every<00:03:11.100> single<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.850> I'm<00:03:11.910> gonna<00:03:12.120> try<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
every single up and I'm gonna try and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.130 
every single up and I'm gonna try and
find<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:13.640> okay<00:03:14.640> what<00:03:15.120> I've<00:03:15.239> tried<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> do<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
find one okay what I've tried to do and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.180 
find one okay what I've tried to do and
that's<00:03:16.260> what<00:03:16.350> my<00:03:16.440> hair<00:03:16.590> looks<00:03:16.739> crazy<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.100> was

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
that's what my hair looks crazy I was

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
that's what my hair looks crazy I was
digging<00:03:17.400> through<00:03:17.520> my<00:03:17.550> hair<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.330> try<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> find

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
digging through my hair to try and find

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.520 
digging through my hair to try and find
a<00:03:18.989> lock<00:03:19.200> where<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> bud<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.280> gonna<00:03:20.520> come<00:03:20.790> off<00:03:20.970> or

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
a lock where a bud is gonna come off or

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
a lock where a bud is gonna come off or
may<00:03:22.530> come<00:03:22.770> off<00:03:22.920> when<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> retighten<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.540> this

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
may come off when I retighten so this

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.880 
may come off when I retighten so this
one

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.260 

as<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.100> see<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> bud<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.850> kind<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.150> just

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
as you can see the bud is kind of just

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.440 
as you can see the bud is kind of just
hanging<00:03:30.630> out<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:34.850> when<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.880> pull<00:03:36.270> them

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
hanging out there when I pull them

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.449 
hanging out there when I pull them
through<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.870> base<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.680> lock<00:03:37.920> since<00:03:38.280> it's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
through the base of my lock since it's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.820 
through the base of my lock since it's
so<00:03:38.700> small<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.780> hole<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.350> going<00:03:40.650> through

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
so small the hole that is going through

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.830 
so small the hole that is going through
this<00:03:41.520> will<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.910> break<00:03:42.120> off<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.690> leave<00:03:42.810> me

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
this will just break off and leave me

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.770 
this will just break off and leave me
with<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.140> shorter<00:03:43.590> than<00:03:43.739> usual<00:03:43.950> lock<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.910> have

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
with a shorter than usual lock I have

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.840 
with a shorter than usual lock I have
combined<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.590> few<00:03:46.620> because<00:03:47.310> they<00:03:47.520> were<00:03:47.580> getting

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
combined a few because they were getting

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.020 
combined a few because they were getting
a<00:03:48.180> bit<00:03:48.560> tiny<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.070> still<00:03:50.400> might<00:03:50.550> combine<00:03:50.910> if

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a bit tiny and I still might combine if

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.360 
a bit tiny and I still might combine if
you<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.570> front<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.959> mean<00:03:52.370> these

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
you like up in the front I mean these

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.670 
you like up in the front I mean these
really<00:03:54.060> scare<00:03:54.390> me<00:03:54.420> these<00:03:54.720> are<00:03:54.900> actually<00:03:57.680> like

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
really scare me these are actually like

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.070 
really scare me these are actually like
I<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.400> was<00:03:59.580> actually<00:03:59.900> combined<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.170> look<00:04:01.350> how

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.430 

little<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:06.240> that's<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
little that is and that's to up that

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.290 
little that is and that's to up that
combined<00:04:07.920> let<00:04:08.370> me<00:04:08.460> try<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.730> find<00:04:08.880> another<00:04:08.970> one

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300

combined let me try and find another one
and<00:04:09.450> see<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.750> ones<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.110> front<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> got

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and see the ones on the front I got

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.670 
and see the ones on the front I got
behind<00:04:10.590> that's<00:04:10.800> easy<00:04:11.010> this<00:04:11.640> no<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:14.190> one<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
behind that's easy this no this one you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.600 
behind that's easy this no this one you
can<00:04:16.830> actually<00:04:16.980> see<00:04:18.800> and<00:04:19.800> I<00:04:19.890> don't<00:04:19.950> know<00:04:20.250> if<00:04:20.459> you

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
can actually see and I don't know if you

can actually see and I don't know if you
can<00:04:20.790> actually<00:04:21.300> notice<00:04:21.780> but<00:04:22.110> the<00:04:22.380> locks

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
can actually notice but the locks

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.880 
can actually notice but the locks
I<00:04:24.420> actually<00:04:24.810> just<00:04:25.080> two<00:04:25.260> strand<00:04:25.560> twists<00:04:25.800> to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
I actually just two strand twists to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.150 
I actually just two strand twists to
them<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:27.710> retightening<00:04:28.710> at<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.980> base

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
them and retightening at the base

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.360 
them and retightening at the base
together<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.840> lots<00:04:31.050> are<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:31.380> smooth<00:04:31.860> they're

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
together the lots are not smooth they're

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.630 
together the lots are not smooth they're
not<00:04:33.320> particularly<00:04:34.320> neat<00:04:34.920> aren't<00:04:35.400> really

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
not particularly neat aren't really

not particularly neat aren't really
matted<00:04:36.420> into<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.930> cylinder<00:04:37.920> as<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.340> can<00:04:38.550> see

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
matted into that cylinder as you can see

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.540 
matted into that cylinder as you can see
they're<00:04:41.670> bumpy<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.840> there's<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.170> whole

they're bumpy and there's a whole

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.780 
they're bumpy and there's a whole
fuzziness<00:04:44.840> going<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.280> that's<00:04:47.280> gonna<00:04:47.430> be<00:04:47.640> there

not lost weight I'm actually gained

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.750 
not lost weight I'm actually gained
weight<00:05:49.410> because<00:05:49.770> of<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.070> lovely<00:05:50.400> winter<00:05:50.640> and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
weight because of the lovely winter and

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.160 
weight because of the lovely winter and
being<00:05:50.940> like<00:05:51.090> sedentary<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.810> not<00:05:51.900> really

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
being like sedentary and not really

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.990 
being like sedentary and not really
walking<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.980> riding<00:05:53.160> my<00:05:53.370> bike<00:05:53.550> as<00:05:53.700> much<00:05:53.850> as<00:05:53.940> I

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
walking and riding my bike as much as I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.900 
walking and riding my bike as much as I
used<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.270> I<00:05:54.570> was<00:05:54.990> just<00:05:55.200> too<00:05:55.920> big<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:56.490> the

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
used to I was just too big and the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.180 
used to I was just too big and the
ankles<00:05:57.360> weren't<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.470> angles<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.070> the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
ankles weren't the angles and the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.900 
ankles weren't the angles and the
pattern<00:05:59.670> warrants<00:06:01.160> sharp<00:06:02.160> enough<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.700> don't

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
pattern warrants sharp enough I don't

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.010 
pattern warrants sharp enough I don't
know<00:06:03.030> if<00:06:03.090> that<00:06:03.180> makes<00:06:03.330> sense<00:06:03.420> so<00:06:03.980> it<00:06:04.980> really

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
know if that makes sense so it really

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.130 
know if that makes sense so it really
doesn't<00:06:07.020> give<00:06:07.290> you<00:06:07.380> that<00:06:07.940> factor<00:06:09.140> because

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
doesn't give you that factor because

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.309
