after<00:01:28.780> all<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> coaster

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.630 

so<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.380> think<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.680> seems<00:01:36.980> pretty<00:01:37.220> good<00:01:37.430> so

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
so I think that seems pretty good so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.280 
so I think that seems pretty good so
what<00:01:37.760> I'll<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:38.030> now<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.240> I'll<00:01:38.420> fill<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
what I'll do now is I'll fill in the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.310 
what I'll do now is I'll fill in the
rest<00:01:39.470> with<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.920> letters<00:01:40.700> upside<00:01:41.150> down<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.230> you

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
rest with the letters upside down so you

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.070 
rest with the letters upside down so you
can<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.710> always<00:01:43.040> use<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.730> letter<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.390> blank

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
can you always use a letter as a blank

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.210 
can you always use a letter as a blank
just<00:01:45.530> flip<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.830> over<00:01:46.010> and<00:01:46.480> just<00:01:47.480> pop<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.220> so

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
just flip it over and just pop it in so

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.120 
just flip it over and just pop it in so
there<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.460> go<00:01:49.750> you've<00:01:50.750> got<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.530> coaster
