00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.870
 Pat arrives on Wednesday night. 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.150
 Really, nice. Will he stay here? 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.930
 Yes, it will. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.820
 (click sound) 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 So many animals die while you read. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.890
 (click sound) 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.259
 Thanks for inviting me to a movie night. So what are we looking at? 

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.529
 The Great Earthlings Movie You'll Like It! 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.149
 You know, meat contains poop. 

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.569
 You know milk contains pus. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.759
 You know apples can be covered with beeswax. 

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.419
 You know that ... ah, you're not eating. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.709
 I can't believe I woke up with such a pimple! 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:50.940
 This is from meat consumption! 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.009
 (sniffing) 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.079
 This is from consuming dairy products! 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 This is from eating eggs! 

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.980
 (sneezing) 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 Swine flu 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.900
 (coughing) 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.580
 bird flu 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.000
 You know, this is from the lack of fiber! 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 (knocking) 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.560
 Come back - I made you some walnut cheese. 

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:23.880
 Hi, this is Emily from "Bite Size Vegan", I hope you enjoyed this little vegan nugget 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.029
 sometimes we can make fun of ourselves, vegans. Of course, 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.729
 mostly it is based on reality, but we are sometimes able to laugh at ourselves. 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.220
 Oh, aren't you? 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890
 So ... (whisper), I'm sorry for this video. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.390
 If you are not a vegan and want a more settled discussion of why vegans are sometimes so passionate 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.609
 you can look at this video - also links up and down - don't worry 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.249
 without graphics. And for my vegans, out there if you want to find ways to talk 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.979
 about veganism that is more effective than what you just saw (not so much), take me and 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.929
 Check out my other videos on the subject, and also stay tuned for more content, focused 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.490
 on communication between vegans and non-vegans. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.670
 And, eventually, the whole e-course on the subject! 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.400
 If this made you laugh, give the video a thumb up and share it around you and spread the laughter. 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.780
 If you want to laugh for yourself, check my next video "shit people say 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.510
 it vegans "or my vegan superhero" the veganizer "where I beat carnivores on the run 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.970
 in the face and I'm generally a little stupid, or look at my much more serious explanations 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.540
 why we vegan, we seem so sharp, in my video "what vegans see". If you want 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.869

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.549
 OK, it's pus. 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.400
 Pus. 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.740
 Pus. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
