episode we completed the book of a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.079 
episode we completed the book of a
design<00:00:13.110> by<00:00:13.440> adding<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> final<00:00:14.250> type<00:00:14.610> elements

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
design by adding the final type elements

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.540 
design by adding the final type elements
to<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> composition<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.890> tutorial<00:00:17.100> I'm

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
to the composition in this tutorial I'm

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.820 
to the composition in this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> discuss<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.690> demonstrate<00:00:18.930> how<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
going to discuss and demonstrate how I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.670 
going to discuss and demonstrate how I
will<00:00:20.189> finalize<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> design<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.510> look<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.439> how

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
will finalize the design and look at how

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
will finalize the design and look at how
to<00:00:22.740> export<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> artwork<00:00:23.850> ready<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> be

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to export the artwork ready to be

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.769 
to export the artwork ready to be
supplied<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> printers<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.550> print<00:00:26.789> so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
supplied to the printers for print so

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
supplied to the printers for print so
here<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.170> where<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.590> left<00:00:28.830> off<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
here we are where we left off in the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
here we are where we left off in the
previous<00:00:29.400> tutorial<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> document<00:00:31.170> open

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
previous tutorial with the document open

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.220 
previous tutorial with the document open
now<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.610> design<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.210> pretty<00:00:33.450> much<00:00:33.750> complete

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
now this design is pretty much complete

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
now this design is pretty much complete
but<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.059> just

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
but what I'm going to do now is just

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
but what I'm going to do now is just
refine<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> positioning<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
refine the positioning of some of the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
refine the positioning of some of the
elements<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:39.809> start<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> clouds

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
elements so I'll start with the clouds

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
elements so I'll start with the clouds
here<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> change<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
here now if I want to change the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
here now if I want to change the
position<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> these<00:00:44.040> clouds<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.640> can

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
position of any of these clouds I can

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
position of any of these clouds I can
come<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> layers<00:00:45.870> panel<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.410> double

I come to image mode and I can see there

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.440 
I come to image mode and I can see there
is<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> check<00:02:51.239> next<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.750> CMYK<00:02:52.370> great<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.209> all

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
is a check next to CMYK great so all

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.259 
is a check next to CMYK great so all
conditions<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.320> perfect<00:02:55.620> now<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:57.000> save
