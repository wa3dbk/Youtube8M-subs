instead of going to reach for the toner
which<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.420> my<00:01:17.659> opinion<00:01:17.810> toners<00:01:18.619> really<00:01:19.069> should

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
which in my opinion toners really should

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.190 
which in my opinion toners really should
only<00:01:19.789> be<00:01:19.969> used<00:01:19.999> after<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.630> got<00:01:20.869> your<00:01:21.049> hair
