00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.020
 well today again with the pvp 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.750
 Anna goes mae is back I believe 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 You notice we are knocking here now 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.020
 pretty heavy are also quite nice 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.220
 many of them I have to do again 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.350
 say respect as he likes this mass 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 get together are also clear 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.890
 many of them fall over at one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 catchword that actually does not matter 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.609
 The main thing you get somehow the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 Together, save the little ones 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.600
 a with ttp this number must have one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 little bit on the warrior equipment 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.860
 dodge there just with my jesu 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 Runs through the area and he just 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 have a little fun because of his 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.420
 unfortunately not yet there 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 he will overtake him because we ours 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.660
 magic so far so far do not need 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.899
 could the class simply shit 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
 We have the most 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.289
 which of course is not brought over 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 made no sense then we have the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.350
 were dead accounts now if i am all 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.420
 revived and called into a corner 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 yes, I have to say here with the pet 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 System shit real shit 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 but there you look that you her 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 this petz again by runway makes 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.659
 you run here in this body purely like that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.880
 often against other betz was that so many 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.350
 are and you can hardly move one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 always has to go on the gaul and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.000
 out go because only in this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.770
 I'm good at the whole pad I have to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.799
 Do this anyway because I am the one 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 main focus of which is that way 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.439
 partly because of the videos and bin 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.930
 Stop it from 300 then you are 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 not exactly popular with the others 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.189
 or just because the tanami and yes 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.680
 so you have to go in between times 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 little bit of what is going on here because of you 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 there are six seven people at the packard 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.810
 or sometimes two times is so much 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.329
 already exaggerated 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.360
 even with a lot of magic the crush 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.850
 animal still 10 k stone row with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.030
 follow with edf I mean the 15 times edf 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.129
 still in the drinne in the hairstyle and 15 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.550
 magic the costumes and everything else 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.310
 the old and the old come here 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.569
 and around me now 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.120
 just under eight carum depending on how local 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.800
 stone in it stop on 11 k it is 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.510
 It's just too much, I think it's good 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.860
 that they made the magic search stronger 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.550
 Definitely because had before 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.599
 they simply do not make sense and they are not worth anything 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.519
 but that is a bit over the top 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.630
 here it says at the moment who has 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.910
 most magical classes wins 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.739
 it is quite good that the red right 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.170
 Many have noticed you right since then 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.790
 the update has come all the magic 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.709
 they really only care about it 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.810
 have been waiting for something to happen 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.290
 and no longer had any problems 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.450
 gamble 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.549
 they're just getting really active and are 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.350
 suddenly I feel more cool 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.700
 makes sense somehow the stone 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.500
 I find it a bit over the top 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.810
 So reducing 50 is too much 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.700
 25 to 30 I would still somewhere 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.709
 agree with it because he has to 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.319
 look far that you search more 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.760
 Bracelet goes or on the finder's belt 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.799
 then we can do that too 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.299
 also under meant so is just so much 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.549
 if you look at the pdf with the 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.560
 five cars swallows then that's too much 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.109
 then come if necessary 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.660
 that's 16 k or so dimension 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.489
 trainer has and we're talking about here 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.569
 his 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.310
 I collect the smaller ones yes 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.390
 much more I am with the visitor 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.950
 a little something through the city 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.200
 I only run a four-stone 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.590
 in the fusion threesome stone in the 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.600
 weapon because no one is sure of that market 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.859
 arm and a leg and when times as a 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.430
 since it is relatively away quickly and 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.609
 well, so in part but quite energy classes 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.040
 people walking on chaos buys right that 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:04.310
 so that if it is 15 to 16 million 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.010
 a joke I find the Japanese here 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.620
 just when knocking always pvp that 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.450
 all a bit stupid because all 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.389
 other classes that works if you 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.190
 goes down and the one is at a 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.350
 and it then pops the so yes it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.030
 then you still get off nee that is 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.010
 from the lycan not so when you go 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.289
 and the guy is standing there and you 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.020
 make a game on which that means 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.940
 not that he gets it 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.560
 then you have to wait first how did he have 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.420
 is he is now just moved in 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.940
 skill if a skill can do then 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.090
 you on it woman and then meet so find 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.340
 I'm a bit unfair to the legal 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.530
 right here in pvp here right now 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.620
 in such battles where it totally anyway 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.740
 hang there we can tell that wanted to tell 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.680
 you at the computer 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.680
 Well, I 'm looking forward to that anyway 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.090
 now yes what is called friend is was too 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.950
 quite pleasant her of one month 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.550
 just a little chill pvm 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.200
 do 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.470
 I think we are a lot further 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.000
 Than we did that with our pads and 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.880
 Well, that's not all that dramatic 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.610
 I believe that pet system is being 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.980
 the whole pvp system again quite a lot 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180
 change 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.700
 You do not really know what they are 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.270
 bring crafts everything because of for 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.190
 is not so much heard of but the 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.540
 after that if this invincible for ten 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.100
 seconds and you can do any 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.700
 minute then it can not 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.130
 get annoying or with the car the one 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.600
 500 tpd every ten seconds at the opponent 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.160
 cloud and you get the himself has 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.930
 then that's pretty tough too 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.340
 are all so saying I have no idea 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.610
 we have to wait let's see what's 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:47.720
 but first comes out a little bit 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.610
 then yes, we have done here now 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.640
 some people feel they are 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.120
 yes mega cool lead ricaner go too 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.250
 every 90s by which I find myself 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.070
 a little funny because he has 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.780
 Only when time equipment is upgraded all 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.550
 others laugh at what someone else laughs at 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.940
 so but separates tubers legal of 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.970
 father so the father can get that 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.350
 well there were the people in the pvp 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.750
 who do not travel that much and then 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.000
 think out in time and the judges or 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.950
 I can prove myself with that 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.620
 total nonsense skating I had for the 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.820
 pv equipment part nothing to look for 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.680
 or does not need to be so blatant 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.260
 represent 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.140
 Furthermore , the little bit funny 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.610
 army goes and cloud ours with us 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.170
 Idea we are 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.980
 all pretty good friends you with z 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:46.360
 walking around then belong together 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:49.840
 yes and now you 're done with a yes 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.150
 then allowed a special case 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.440
 I know I do not know yet I have it 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.180
 not yet heard of him 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.240
 or so, but it seems like it has 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.280
 to be called in something or something 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.410
 a shit I do not remember how 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.600
 it exactly wants to pronounce or wait 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.020
 In any case, that was no more 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.700
 to 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.630
 maybe mother just a bit 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.610
 too much bullied with the nickname 14 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.960
 it was a bit embarrassing though 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.600
 in between times something wrong 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:21.610
 writes that does not come so well though 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:25.210
 well, the red is in my opinion 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.170
 won times because you 're done army 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.240
 too slow 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.400
 they are not bothered or not 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.930
 blessing, no more clue anyway 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.760
 always curious how many still see 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.240
 circulation have my stock is still good 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.980
 full 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.600
 and if not then will stop again 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.490
 Well done in any case 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.740
 Now our magic classes are getting better 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.660
 know or we are also aware that 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.550
 the magic is weaker again 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.220
 In any case, this is possible 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.320
 yes not that did not work 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.790
 that would mean if you have six magic 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.590
 so then has everything if 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.070
 even twice with a gdf 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:05.950
 to meet 

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:07.930
 smart and dead well in that sense wishes 

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.530
 I still wish you all the best and we will listen 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.530
 us the days
