and loved the attention which is
probably<00:03:47.370> why<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.329> he<00:03:48.510> would<00:03:48.629> do<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.900> so

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
probably why and he would do it so

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.660 
probably why and he would do it so
perfectly<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.769> time<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.310> didn't<00:03:50.549> get

perfectly all the time and I didn't get

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.569 
perfectly all the time and I didn't get
it<00:03:50.819> as<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.000> kid<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:51.569> he<00:03:52.379> would<00:03:52.650> pause<00:03:52.980> as<00:03:53.400> though

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
it as a kid but he would pause as though

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
hearing the question and think about it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.789 
hearing the question and think about it
and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.900> he<00:03:57.959> would<00:03:58.170> look<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.440> audience
