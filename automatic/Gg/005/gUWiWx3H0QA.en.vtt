00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
of them but quite a lot at nightmares

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.369 
of them but quite a lot at nightmares
own<00:00:42.399> recently<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.569> reason<00:00:43.809> i<00:00:43.839> did<00:00:43.989> nightmares

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
own recently the reason i did nightmares

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.719 
own recently the reason i did nightmares
own<00:00:44.530> was<00:00:44.710> because<00:00:44.979> I<00:00:45.069> was<00:00:45.159> worried<00:00:45.519> that<00:00:45.550> I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
own was because I was worried that I

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.639 
own was because I was worried that I
wouldn't<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.089> able<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.359> max<00:00:46.719> in<00:00:46.899> time<00:00:47.170> or

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
wouldn't be able to max in time or

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.739 
wouldn't be able to max in time or
maximally<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.399> time<00:00:48.640> before<00:00:48.850> cob<00:00:49.239> comes<00:00:49.539> out

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
maximally in time before cob comes out

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.919 
maximally in time before cob comes out
but<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:50.260> I'm<00:00:50.409> confident<00:00:50.769> that<00:00:50.889> I<00:00:50.979> can<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.929> I

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
but now I'm confident that I can and I

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.930 
but now I'm confident that I can and I
have<00:00:53.440> gained<00:00:53.769> a<00:00:53.800> significant<00:00:54.670> amount<00:00:54.819> of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
have gained a significant amount of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.430 
have gained a significant amount of
levels<00:00:55.329> obviously<00:00:55.749> that's<00:00:55.899> going<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.139> suffer

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
levels obviously that's going to suffer

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.259 
levels obviously that's going to suffer
with<00:00:56.589> my<00:00:56.739> Slayer<00:00:57.069> which<00:00:57.339> is<00:00:57.519> why<00:00:57.850> what<00:00:58.179> I'm
