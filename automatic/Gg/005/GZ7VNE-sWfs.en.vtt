00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
first problem

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.429 
first problem
this<00:00:16.049> says<00:00:16.410> find<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> sine<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.910> theta<00:00:18.300> if<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
this says find the sine of theta if the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.700 
this says find the sine of theta if the
cosine<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> theta<00:00:20.490> equals<00:00:20.910> negative<00:00:21.810> square

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
cosine of theta equals negative square

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.089 
cosine of theta equals negative square
root<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.920> 3<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.220> 2<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.050> theta<00:00:25.050> terminates<00:00:25.859> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
root of 3 over 2 and theta terminates in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.750 
root of 3 over 2 and theta terminates in
Quadrant<00:00:26.730> 3<00:00:27.199> okay<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.260> we're<00:00:29.160> looking<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
Quadrant 3 okay so we're looking for a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.900 
Quadrant 3 okay so we're looking for a
sign<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:31.199> given<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> cosign<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.730> we've

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
sign and we're given a cosign and we've

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
sign and we're given a cosign and we've
got<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> trigonometric<00:00:33.630> identity<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
got a trigonometric identity that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.200 
got a trigonometric identity that
equates<00:00:35.280> sines<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.239> cosines<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.620> says<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
equates sines and cosines this says the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
equates sines and cosines this says the
sine<00:00:39.570> squared<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.500> theta<00:00:41.450> plus<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.780> cosine

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
sine squared of theta plus the cosine

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
sine squared of theta plus the cosine
squared<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.489> theta<00:00:46.340> equals<00:00:47.340> 1<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.230> we're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
squared of theta equals 1 so if we're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
squared of theta equals 1 so if we're
looking<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> signs<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.550> sine<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> theta

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
looking for the signs the sine of theta

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.279 
looking for the signs the sine of theta
let's<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> sine<00:00:52.559> squared<00:00:53.010> by<00:00:53.160> itself

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
let's get this sine squared by itself

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.830 
let's get this sine squared by itself
we'll<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.440> sine<00:00:55.680> squared<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.430> theta<00:00:56.840> equals

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
we'll have sine squared of theta equals

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.700 
we'll have sine squared of theta equals
1<00:00:58.340> minus<00:00:59.539> the<00:01:00.539> cosine<00:01:00.570> squared<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:02.280> theta<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
1 minus the cosine squared of theta and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.320 
1 minus the cosine squared of theta and
let's<00:01:04.710> plug<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> value<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.790> cosine<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
let's plug in the value for cosine of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.620 
let's plug in the value for cosine of
theta<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.860> negative<00:01:08.460> square<00:01:09.119> root<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> 3

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
theta that was negative square root of 3

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.770 
theta that was negative square root of 3
over<00:01:10.020> 2

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
over 2

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
over 2
negative<00:01:12.780> square<00:01:13.290> root<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.680> 3<00:01:14.070> over<00:01:14.820> 2<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.840> want

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
negative square root of 3 over 2 we want

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
negative square root of 3 over 2 we want
to<00:01:16.080> square<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.960> 1<00:01:19.710> minus

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to square that so going to have 1 minus

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.749 
to square that so going to have 1 minus
let's<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.799> negative<00:01:22.799> square<00:01:23.280> root<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> 3

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
let's see negative square root of 3

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
let's see negative square root of 3
squared<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.920> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.189> 3<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> 2<00:01:28.110> squared

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
squared is going to be 3 and 2 squared

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.399 
squared is going to be 3 and 2 squared
is<00:01:28.530> 4<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.790> 1<00:01:30.060> minus<00:01:30.590> 3/4<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:32.610> equals<00:01:33.409> 1

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
is 4 so it's 1 minus 3/4 that equals 1

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.660 
is 4 so it's 1 minus 3/4 that equals 1
over<00:01:34.770> 4<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.960> that's<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.350> sine<00:01:37.650> squared<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
over 4 and that's the sine squared of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.740 
over 4 and that's the sine squared of
theta<00:01:39.200> we<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> sine<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> theta<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.750> we'll

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
theta we want the sine of theta so we'll

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
theta we want the sine of theta so we'll
take<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> square<00:01:43.530> root<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> both<00:01:43.979> sides<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
take the square root of both sides the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.080 
take the square root of both sides the
square<00:01:45.240> root<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> 1/4<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.470> 1/2

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
square root of 1/4 is 1/2

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
square root of 1/4 is 1/2
now<00:01:48.090> signs<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.439> sometimes<00:01:49.890> positive<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
now signs are sometimes positive and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
now signs are sometimes positive and
sometimes<00:01:50.820> negative<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:52.200> depends<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.950> what

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
sometimes negative that depends on what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510 
sometimes negative that depends on what
quadrant<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.420> angle<00:01:54.450> terminates<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
quadrant the angle terminates in and in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.830 
quadrant the angle terminates in and in
this<00:01:56.670> case<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.210> terminates<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.990> Quadrant<00:01:58.469> 3

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
this case it terminates in Quadrant 3

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.130 
this case it terminates in Quadrant 3
so<00:02:01.210> we're<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.509> have<00:02:02.600> an<00:02:02.689> angle<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so we're going to have an angle it

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.850 
so we're going to have an angle it
begins<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.649> standard<00:02:04.100> position<00:02:05.860> terminates

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
begins in standard position terminates

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.400 
begins in standard position terminates
in<00:02:07.100> Quadrant<00:02:07.640> three<00:02:07.909> in<00:02:08.539> Quadrant<00:02:09.080> three

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
in Quadrant three in Quadrant three

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.820 
in Quadrant three in Quadrant three
signs<00:02:10.340> are<00:02:10.819> negative<00:02:11.120> because<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.230> Y<00:02:12.410> values

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
signs are negative because the Y values

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.370 
signs are negative because the Y values
are<00:02:12.980> negative<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:14.360> sign<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.840> theta<00:02:15.050> is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
are negative so this sign of theta is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670 
are negative so this sign of theta is
going<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.739> equal<00:02:15.830> negative<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:17.540> half<00:02:17.750> okay

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
going to equal negative one half okay

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.580 
going to equal negative one half okay
so<00:02:19.250> pay<00:02:19.519> attention<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.269> quadrant<00:02:20.930> that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
so pay attention to the quadrant that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.460 
so pay attention to the quadrant that
your<00:02:22.130> angle<00:02:22.519> terminates<00:02:22.819> in<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:24.080> will<00:02:24.230> tell

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
your angle terminates in that will tell

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.290 
your angle terminates in that will tell
you<00:02:24.680> whether<00:02:24.920> your<00:02:25.280> function<00:02:25.730> ends<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.120> being

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
you whether your function ends up being

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.229 
you whether your function ends up being
positive<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.959> negative<00:02:27.550> okay<00:02:28.550> let's<00:02:29.120> try

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
positive or negative okay let's try

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.780 
positive or negative okay let's try
another<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:32.830> let's<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.130> with<00:02:34.220> tangents

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
another one let's do one with tangents

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.970 
another one let's do one with tangents
and<00:02:34.940> secants<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.970> we're<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.080> have<00:02:39.290> find

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
and secants so we're going to have find

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.680 
and secants so we're going to have find
the<00:02:40.519> tangent<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.360> theta<00:02:41.560> if<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.700> secant<00:02:44.360> of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
the tangent of theta if the secant of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.370 
the tangent of theta if the secant of
theta<00:02:46.150> equals<00:02:47.680> let's<00:02:48.680> see<00:02:48.890> negative<00:02:49.819> two

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
theta equals let's see negative two

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.520 
theta equals let's see negative two
times<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.620> square<00:02:51.799> root<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.280> three<00:02:52.700> over

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
times the square root of three over

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.729 
times the square root of three over
three<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.540> we'll<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.840> terminate<00:02:57.470> in

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
three and we'll have this terminate in

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.840 
three and we'll have this terminate in
Quadrant<00:02:58.610> two<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.019> therian<00:03:03.730> identity<00:03:04.730> we

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
Quadrant two so the therian identity we

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.060 
Quadrant two so the therian identity we
want<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.329> going<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.690> be<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.470> one<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.799> says

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
want is going to be the one that says

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.050 
want is going to be the one that says
the<00:03:07.910> tangent<00:03:08.660> squared<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.950> theta<00:03:10.880> plus<00:03:11.650> one

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
the tangent squared of theta plus one

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.789 
the tangent squared of theta plus one
equals<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.260> secant<00:03:15.799> squared<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.609> theta<00:03:17.799> okay

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
equals the secant squared of theta okay

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.670 
equals the secant squared of theta okay
we're<00:03:19.280> looking<00:03:19.519> for<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> tangent<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.410> let's

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
we're looking for a tangent so let's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.390 
we're looking for a tangent so let's
isolate<00:03:22.239> tangent<00:03:23.239> squared<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:24.319> one<00:03:24.980> side<00:03:25.250> of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
isolate tangent squared on one side of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.710 
isolate tangent squared on one side of
the<00:03:25.489> equation<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.329> we'll<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.739> equals

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the equation and we'll have that equals

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.620 
the equation and we'll have that equals
secant<00:03:29.720> squared<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.560> theta<00:03:31.900> minus<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.170> and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
secant squared of theta minus one and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.170 
secant squared of theta minus one and
secant<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.810> theta<00:03:36.079> was<00:03:36.650> negative<00:03:37.430> two<00:03:37.760> times

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
secant of theta was negative two times

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.599 
secant of theta was negative two times
the<00:03:38.329> square<00:03:38.480> root<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.780> three<00:03:39.049> over<00:03:39.079> three<00:03:39.609> so

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
the square root of three over three so

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.770 
the square root of three over three so
we<00:03:40.760> want<00:03:40.970> negative<00:03:41.600> two<00:03:42.850> times<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.299> square

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
we want negative two times the square

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.660 
we want negative two times the square
root<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:45.079> three<00:03:45.500> over<00:03:45.829> three<00:03:46.900> squared<00:03:48.670> minus

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
root of three over three squared minus

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.650 
root of three over three squared minus
one<00:03:51.549> well<00:03:52.549> negative<00:03:52.790> two<00:03:53.120> squared<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.600> four

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
one well negative two squared is four

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.710 
one well negative two squared is four
square<00:03:54.590> root<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.920> three<00:03:55.190> squared<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.639> 3<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.480> 4

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
square root of three squared is 3 so 4

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.949 
square root of three squared is 3 so 4
times<00:03:56.930> 3<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.260> 12<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:58.480> three<00:03:59.480> squared<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.900> nine

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
times 3 is 12 and three squared is nine

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.599 
times 3 is 12 and three squared is nine
so<00:04:00.620> I've<00:04:01.100> got<00:04:01.250> 12<00:04:01.549> over<00:04:01.850> nine<00:04:02.030> minus<00:04:02.959> one<00:04:03.609> let's

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
so I've got 12 over nine minus one let's

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.030 
so I've got 12 over nine minus one let's
take<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.060> one<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.720> turn<00:04:05.989> it<00:04:06.139> into<00:04:06.290> nine<00:04:06.680> over

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
take that one and turn it into nine over

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.890 
take that one and turn it into nine over
nine

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.660 

so<00:04:10.440> twelve<00:04:10.890> nine<00:04:11.159> minus<00:04:12.120> nine<00:04:12.150> nine<00:04:12.659> is<00:04:13.049> just

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
so twelve nine minus nine nine is just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.420 
so twelve nine minus nine nine is just
three<00:04:15.590> over<00:04:16.590> nine<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.299> tangent

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
three over nine and that's the tangent

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.090 
three over nine and that's the tangent
squared<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.699> theta<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.590> want<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> take<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
squared of theta so we want to take the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.730 
squared of theta so we want to take the
square<00:04:23.370> roots<00:04:23.669> of<00:04:23.790> both<00:04:23.850> sides<00:04:24.500> I'm<00:04:25.500> gonna

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
square roots of both sides I'm gonna

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.000 
square roots of both sides I'm gonna
have<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.919> tangent<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.550> theta<00:04:26.820> equals<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
have the tangent of theta equals the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.070 
have the tangent of theta equals the
square<00:04:29.280> root<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:29.940> three<00:04:30.419> over<00:04:30.889> three<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.460> and

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
square root of three over three you and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.659 
square root of three over three you and
let's<00:04:34.080> see

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
let's see

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.760 
let's see
theta<00:04:35.669> terminates<00:04:36.360> in<00:04:36.540> Quadrant<00:04:37.470> two<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:43.110> over

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
theta terminates in Quadrant two so over

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.270 
theta terminates in Quadrant two so over
here<00:04:43.979> in<00:04:44.130> Quadrant<00:04:44.820> two<00:04:46.100> tangents<00:04:47.100> are

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
here in Quadrant two tangents are

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.820 
here in Quadrant two tangents are
negative<00:04:47.910> because<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.870> Y<00:04:49.199> values<00:04:49.680> are

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
negative because the Y values are

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.310 
negative because the Y values are
positive<00:04:50.039> and<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.030> X<00:04:51.270> values<00:04:51.750> are<00:04:51.930> negative

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
positive and the X values are negative

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.520 
positive and the X values are negative
so<00:04:52.620> this<00:04:53.400> tangent<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.210> theta<00:04:54.479> is<00:04:54.720> going<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.199> be

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
so this tangent of theta is going to be

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.760 
so this tangent of theta is going to be
negative<00:04:56.460> square<00:04:56.910> root<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.330> three<00:04:57.690> over<00:04:58.020> three

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
negative square root of three over three

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:08.659 
negative square root of three over three
and<00:05:00.830> let's<00:05:01.830> fit<00:05:02.039> in<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.310> more<00:05:07.039> so<00:05:08.039> let's<00:05:08.430> do

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
and let's fit in one more so let's do

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.000 
and let's fit in one more so let's do
find<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.840> cosecant<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:11.210> theta<00:05:12.210> if<00:05:13.010> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
find the cosecant of theta if the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.070 
find the cosecant of theta if the
cotangent<00:05:16.190> equals<00:05:17.599> let's<00:05:18.599> just<00:05:18.660> have<00:05:18.930> that

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
cotangent equals let's just have that

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.420 
cotangent equals let's just have that
equal<00:05:19.320> one<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.720> we'll<00:05:21.720> put<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.110> in<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
equal one and we'll put that in the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.879 
equal one and we'll put that in the
first<00:05:23.669> quadrant<00:05:25.039> okay<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:27.200> by<00:05:28.200> Pythagorean

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
first quadrant okay so by Pythagorean

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.670 
first quadrant okay so by Pythagorean
identity<00:05:29.460> for<00:05:29.700> what<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.820> want<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.180> use<00:05:30.620> one<00:05:31.620> that

theta of theta equals the cosecant
squared<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.660> theta<00:05:46.729> I'm<00:05:47.729> going<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.000> swap<00:05:48.330> the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
squared of theta I'm going to swap the

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.900 
squared of theta I'm going to swap the
sides<00:05:48.750> of<00:05:48.930> this<00:05:49.050> in<00:05:49.470> this<00:05:49.590> equation<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:50.729> the

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
sides of this in this equation so the

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.260 
sides of this in this equation so the
cosecant<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:52.070> on<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.220> left<00:05:53.430> side<00:05:53.639> so<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
cosecant is on the left side so the

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.960 
cosecant is on the left side so the
cosecant<00:05:54.810> squared<00:05:55.169> of<00:05:55.260> theta<00:05:55.580> equals<00:05:56.580> one

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
cosecant squared of theta equals one

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:05.750 
cosecant squared of theta equals one
plus<00:05:58.280> cotangent<00:05:59.280> squared<00:06:00.139> of<00:06:01.250> theta<00:06:04.760> we're

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
plus cotangent squared of theta we're

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.580 
plus cotangent squared of theta we're
put<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.240> value<00:06:06.570> for<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.840> cotangent<00:06:07.260> of

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
put in the value for the cotangent of

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.560 
put in the value for the cotangent of
theta<00:06:07.830> cotangent<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:09.270> theta<00:06:09.539> was<00:06:09.930> just<00:06:10.260> one

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
theta cotangent of theta was just one

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.130 
theta cotangent of theta was just one
okay<00:06:12.070> so<00:06:13.070> that's<00:06:13.220> going<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.490> be<00:06:13.580> 1<00:06:13.790> squared<00:06:14.140> 1

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
okay so that's going to be 1 squared 1

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.370 
okay so that's going to be 1 squared 1
plus<00:06:15.170> 1<00:06:15.590> squared<00:06:15.920> is<00:06:16.040> 2<00:06:16.780> so<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:18.400> cosecant

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
plus 1 squared is 2 so the cosecant

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.670 
plus 1 squared is 2 so the cosecant
squared<00:06:21.380> of<00:06:21.710> theta<00:06:22.550> is<00:06:22.910> 2<00:06:23.240> which<00:06:24.200> means<00:06:24.440> that

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
squared of theta is 2 which means that

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.080 
squared of theta is 2 which means that
the<00:06:24.950> cosecant<00:06:25.700> of<00:06:26.060> theta<00:06:26.780> will<00:06:27.710> be<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.220> square

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
the cosecant of theta will be the square

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.480 
the cosecant of theta will be the square
root<00:06:29.120> of<00:06:29.480> 2<00:06:29.750> let's<00:06:30.620> see<00:06:30.770> if<00:06:30.830> that's<00:06:30.980> positive

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
root of 2 let's see if that's positive

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.440 
root of 2 let's see if that's positive
or<00:06:31.610> negative<00:06:32.830> theta<00:06:33.830> terminates<00:06:34.520> in<00:06:34.790> Quadrant

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
or negative theta terminates in Quadrant

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.770 
or negative theta terminates in Quadrant
1

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
1

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:44.290 
1
so<00:06:36.770> in<00:06:37.070> Quadrant<00:06:37.610> 1<00:06:41.530> in<00:06:42.530> Quadrant<00:06:43.040> 1<00:06:43.070> all<00:06:43.970> of

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
so in Quadrant 1 in Quadrant 1 all of

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.410 
so in Quadrant 1 in Quadrant 1 all of
the<00:06:44.450> trig<00:06:45.050> functions<00:06:45.080> are<00:06:45.710> positive<00:06:46.270> so<00:06:47.270> we're

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
the trig functions are positive so we're

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.960 
the trig functions are positive so we're
going<00:06:47.540> to<00:06:47.630> have<00:06:47.810> cosecant<00:06:48.620> of<00:06:48.770> theta<00:06:48.980> equals

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
going to have cosecant of theta equals

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.110 
going to have cosecant of theta equals
the<00:06:50.300> square<00:06:50.660> root<00:06:51.050> of<00:06:51.140> 2<00:06:51.350> okay<00:06:52.280> that's<00:06:52.970> about

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
the square root of 2 okay that's about

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.940 
the square root of 2 okay that's about
it<00:06:53.650> take<00:06:54.650> care<00:06:54.680> I'll<00:06:55.070> see<00:06:55.310> you<00:06:55.550> next<00:06:55.640> time
