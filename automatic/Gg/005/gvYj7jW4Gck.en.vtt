00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello sport analysis staff me and 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.090
 I 'll explain how to get the second 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.770
 fifth day are in the passage just before 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.650
 It was perennial that day or more 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.020
 of actively treasure hunter 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.109
 radical it is referring to the part of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.859
 actively in the treasure chest in flight has 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 rope is very simple you will have to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.550
 to walk by three ropes here goes with 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 careful with calm patience not to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 fall down has to come back from scratch 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.469
 well the secret here is you make me good 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 right at the crossing of the strings of his 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.120
 character has to be right in the middle of the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.180
 run from under you to jump with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 safety 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 so you do not fall 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.690
 I'm doing here with my tauren. 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 because I can guide myself better pro 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.330
 his helmet when the helmet shift 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.229
 they are in the middle I know I have to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.490
 to jump but it's very simple just follow this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 this tip even when you arrive at 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.909
 crossing the two strings when they 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 make this cross is right in the middle and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.060
 followed by the rope below his 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 character has to be right in the middle of it 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.320
 here po 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.810
 here you will see that the latter 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.470
 Cordoba, another in the front 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.409
 My tip is do not play straight to the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.950
 your chance to fall down is well 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 High so what I do I prefer 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.840
 to do it this way so I do not mistake myself 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'm going to the end of the jump rope in that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 cornerstone 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.410
 in the pillar and then I play pillar of the chest and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.180
 I'm good, people wake up because she 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.970
 will control my fall and give me 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.450
 balance to fall right right 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.550
 Good, I hope I have helped if you 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.550
