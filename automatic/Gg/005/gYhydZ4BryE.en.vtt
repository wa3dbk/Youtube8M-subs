camping and the Boundary Waters and all
those<00:00:17.550> fun<00:00:17.760> activities<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> figured<00:00:18.900> why

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
those fun activities so I figured why

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.240 
those fun activities so I figured why
not<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> bag<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.910> act<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> multi

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
not get a bag that can act as a multi

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
not get a bag that can act as a multi
functional<00:00:23.250> purpose<00:00:23.970> type<00:00:24.590> setup<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.269> said<00:00:27.269> go

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
functional purpose type setup so said go

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.859 
functional purpose type setup so said go
on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> hunt<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.359> waterproof<00:00:30.359> backpack

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
on the hunt for a waterproof backpack

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.860 
on the hunt for a waterproof backpack
because<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:31.830> you're<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.450> foraging<00:00:33.450> all

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
because when you're out foraging all

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.040 
because when you're out foraging all
your<00:00:34.170> stuff<00:00:34.829> from<00:00:35.070> point<00:00:35.430> A<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> B<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
your stuff from point A to B you want to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
your stuff from point A to B you want to
be<00:00:37.140> able<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> move<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.860> stuff<00:00:38.300> in<00:00:39.300> one

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
be able to move all your stuff in one

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
be able to move all your stuff in one
trip<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> set<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.379> multiple<00:00:40.559> trips<00:00:40.980> because

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
trip and set up multiple trips because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.389 
trip and set up multiple trips because
sometimes<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> quarter<00:00:42.300> mile<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:43.399> from

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
sometimes it's a quarter mile from from

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.270 
sometimes it's a quarter mile from from
one<00:00:44.730> end<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> next<00:00:45.750> end<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.860> requires<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
one end to the next end so it requires a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
one end to the next end so it requires a
lot<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lot of work and you want to go back and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
lot of work and you want to go back and
forth<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> basically<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.510> wanted<00:00:51.719> something

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
forth so basically we wanted something

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
forth so basically we wanted something
that<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.170> waterproof<00:00:54.559> backpack<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:56.190> up<00:01:02.449> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that was waterproof backpack set up and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.800 
that was waterproof backpack set up and
extremely<00:01:04.019> lightweight<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.510> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
extremely lightweight so this is the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
extremely lightweight so this is the
drive<00:01:07.260> peak<00:01:07.710> bagger<00:01:08.250> again<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.600> an

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
drive peak bagger again it's got an

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.719 
drive peak bagger again it's got an
exterior<00:01:10.229> pouch<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> front

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.719 

apparently<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.850> made<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.270> ice<00:01:15.509> picks<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
apparently it's made for ice picks but

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.720 
apparently it's made for ice picks but
which<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> goes<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:20.240> down<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.509> slots

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
which kind of goes down down these slots

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.800 
which kind of goes down down these slots
see<00:01:24.730> them<00:01:24.850> but<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.300> just<00:01:25.360> one<00:01:25.720> big<00:01:26.110> old<00:01:26.380> hole

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
see them but it's just one big old hole

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.450 
see them but it's just one big old hole
and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:31.230> the<00:01:32.230> ice<00:01:32.380> pick<00:01:32.680> slot<00:01:32.950> goes<00:01:33.160> down

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
and then the ice pick slot goes down

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.570 
and then the ice pick slot goes down
here<00:01:33.790> like<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:40.200> standard<00:01:41.200> old<00:01:41.410> methods<00:01:42.370> is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
here like so standard old methods is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.490 
here like so standard old methods is
roll<00:01:43.450> three<00:01:43.720> times<00:01:44.430> clip<00:01:46.440> done<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.110> little

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
roll three times clip done is a little

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.690 
roll three times clip done is a little
area<00:01:50.620> down<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:51.190> where<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.400> can<00:01:51.550> put

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
area down here where you can put

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.730 
area down here where you can put
something<00:01:52.000> else<00:01:52.150> some<00:01:53.050> type<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.230> other<00:01:53.470> toy

the<00:02:14.050> way<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.560> designed

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the way it's designed

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
the way it's designed
let's<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> weight

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
let's see if I can get a weight

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.030 
let's see if I can get a weight
measurement<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.709> beast<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.830> my

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
measurement on this beast this is my

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.100 
measurement on this beast this is my
trusty<00:02:22.050> frisbee

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.190 

it's<00:02:26.860> gonna<00:02:27.040> act<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> plate

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:42.420 

tear<00:02:34.290> rolled<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.710> nice<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.160> small
