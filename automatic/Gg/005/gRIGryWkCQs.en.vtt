very simple very easy to attack it's
either<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.120> building<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.020> if

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
either one building or the other and if

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
either one building or the other and if
you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.410> three<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.309> three<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> each<00:00:48.090> side<00:00:48.120> it

you have three on three on each side it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
you have three on three on each side it
is<00:00:48.840> extremely<00:00:49.260> easy<00:00:49.469> most<00:00:50.399> again<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:50.910> had

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is extremely easy most again we only had

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
is extremely easy most again we only had
about<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.750> only<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.020> five<00:00:52.199> players

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
about I think we only have five players

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.650 
about I think we only have five players
in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> end<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.250> only<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.449> fire

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in the end so we only did this with fire

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
in the end so we only did this with fire
players<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.340> lot<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.000> suppose
