these are fuel-injected they mission

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.249 
these are fuel-injected they mission
switches<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:42.180> we've<00:01:42.420> gotten<00:01:42.720> gone<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
switches right here we've gotten gone so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
switches right here we've gotten gone so
we'll<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.710> ahead<00:01:43.770> push<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> button

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
we'll just go ahead push the button

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.480 
we'll just go ahead push the button
start<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.229> idle<00:01:46.710> fast<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
start it up now these idle fast for a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
start it up now these idle fast for a
minute<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.380> when<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> first<00:01:49.590> crank<00:01:49.920> them

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
minute or so when you first crank them

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
minute or so when you first crank them
up<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.630> warmed<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.170> or

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

so here it runs nice it has a great
sound<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.550> those<00:02:33.700> pipes<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.360> got<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> fuel

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
sound to it those pipes on it got a fuel

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.050 
sound to it those pipes on it got a fuel
gauge<00:02:35.400> speedometer<00:02:36.400> got<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.730> digital

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
gauge speedometer got the digital

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.520
