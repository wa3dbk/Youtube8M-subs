00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
I even cut it this is how much lace you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.530 
I even cut it this is how much lace you
get<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.150> it's<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.360> soft<00:03:48.630> lace<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
get and it's a soft lace so in the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.370 
get and it's a soft lace so in the
middle<00:03:52.340> right<00:03:53.340> where<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.510> people<00:03:54.959> start<00:03:55.230> at<00:03:55.350> I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
middle right where the people start at I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.170 
middle right where the people start at I
would<00:03:55.620> say<00:03:57.260> yeah<00:03:58.260> three<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.550> half<00:03:59.700> inches

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
would say yeah three and a half inches

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.540 
would say yeah three and a half inches
on<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.570> unit<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.200> don't<00:04:01.860> know<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.370> them<00:04:02.459> I

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
on this unit I don't know one of them I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.190 
on this unit I don't know one of them I
think<00:04:02.610> was<00:04:02.880> four<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.239> half<00:04:03.300> inches<00:04:03.750> they<00:04:04.140> do

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
think was four and a half inches they do

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960 
think was four and a half inches they do
come<00:04:04.590> with<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.860> combs<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:05.850> to

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
worry about that you don't have to tape

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.350 
worry about that you don't have to tape
use<00:04:07.500> tape<00:04:07.770> or<00:04:07.950> anything<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:08.910> it

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
use tape or anything like that but it

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.660 
use tape or anything like that but it
does<00:04:09.660> come<00:04:10.080> with<00:04:10.290> tape<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.220> unit<00:04:11.489> does<00:04:11.520> come

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
does come with tape the unit does come

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.699 
does come with tape the unit does come
with<00:04:12.000> tape<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.360> case<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> use<00:04:13.230> tape<00:04:13.590> I

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
don't use the tape I use the combs as

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.990 
don't use the tape I use the combs as
well<00:04:16.049> as<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> combing<00:04:16.830> of<00:04:16.950> back<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.520> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
well as the combing of back and the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.330 
well as the combing of back and the
adjustable<00:04:18.540> straps<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.169> their<00:04:19.890> wigs

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
adjustable straps and their wigs

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.310 
adjustable straps and their wigs
it<00:04:20.489> all<00:04:20.730> depends<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.480> color<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.080> hair

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
it all depends on the color of the hair

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.310 
it all depends on the color of the hair
so<00:04:23.010> say<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.280> had<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> color<00:04:23.820> 1b<00:04:24.360> your<00:04:25.020> cap

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
so say you had a color 1b your cap

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.990 
so say you had a color 1b your cap
construction<00:04:25.590> wouldn't<00:04:26.310> be<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.580> light<00:04:26.880> it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
construction wouldn't be this light it

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.580 
construction wouldn't be this light it
would<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.360> know<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.780> black<00:04:28.140> lace

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590

lace right here but the weaving the cap

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.890 
lace right here but the weaving the cap
construction<00:04:32.610> will<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.300> dark<00:04:33.660> color

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900

where ozone they make their cap
constructions<00:04:37.919> lighter<00:04:38.190> too

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
constructions lighter too

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.290 
constructions lighter too
actually<00:04:39.160> hold<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> hair<00:04:39.819> the<00:04:39.970> tracks

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
actually hold with the hair the tracks

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.110 
actually hold with the hair the tracks
are<00:04:40.569> lighter<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.889> forth<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:43.000> know

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
are lighter and so forth so you know

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.270 
are lighter and so forth so you know
same<00:04:43.750> thing<00:04:43.780> with<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.229> darker<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:45.069> what<00:04:45.190> I'm

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
same thing with the darker so what I'm

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.369 
same thing with the darker so what I'm
gonna<00:04:45.400> do<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:45.879> is<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.360> said<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:46.599> wavy<00:04:47.050> unit

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
gonna do this is like I said a wavy unit

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.830 
gonna do this is like I said a wavy unit
and<00:04:47.919> she's<00:04:48.190> really<00:04:48.490> pretty<00:04:48.669> in<00:04:48.849> full<00:04:49.180> she's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
and she's really pretty in full she's

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.540 
and she's really pretty in full she's
got<00:04:50.050> blonde<00:04:50.409> streaks<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.919> them<00:04:51.069> but<00:04:51.220> not<00:04:51.370> as

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
got blonde streaks in them but not as

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.129 
got blonde streaks in them but not as
much<00:04:51.729> as<00:04:51.909> moonstone<00:04:52.449> this<00:04:52.690> because<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.050> a

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
much as moonstone this because it's a

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.570 
much as moonstone this because it's a
darker<00:04:53.470> color<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:53.949> think<00:04:54.159> this<00:04:54.280> color<00:04:54.460> is

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
darker color and I think this color is

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.960 
darker color and I think this color is
probably<00:04:54.759> like<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.180> number<00:04:55.509> two<00:04:55.750> as<00:04:55.990> well<00:04:56.970> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
probably like the number two as well the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.749 
probably like the number two as well the
color<00:04:58.150> name<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.870> called<00:04:59.139> Fame<00:04:59.470> F<00:04:59.770> AME<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.610> the

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
color name is called Fame F AME like the

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.939 
color name is called Fame F AME like the
movie<00:05:01.030> fame<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> color<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.440> name<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
movie fame so the color of the name the

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.850 
movie fame so the color of the name the
color<00:05:03.129> of<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.340> wig<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.639> actually<00:05:03.970> called<00:05:04.210> Fame

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
color of the wig is actually called Fame

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.800 
color of the wig is actually called Fame
so<00:05:05.860> Rama<00:05:06.400> do<00:05:06.610> real<00:05:06.819> quick<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.060> cut<00:05:07.419> off<00:05:07.599> the

so Rama do real quick is cut off the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.830 
so Rama do real quick is cut off the
lace<00:05:08.409> and<00:05:08.710> I'll<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.919> right<00:05:09.099> back

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840
