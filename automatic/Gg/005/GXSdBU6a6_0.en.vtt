00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.039
lot to do

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.590
to get organized here and for starters
you recommend

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.180
putting a big discount or not a little
one but a big win on the wall tell us

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.830
why in

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.140
what you can do with all those pens sure
you know

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.570
so much and being organized is knowing
what's coming up that will need to be

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.710
organized for

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.440
absolutely so a master calendar has
everything

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.140
your family has going on is so important
i'm talking everything school

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.980
assignments

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.050
after school programs business trip that
one of the parents are taking

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.230
special mom and dad time you know if
you're technologically savvy

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.020
you could set this up I calendar or
Outlook but if you prefer paper and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.699
i do. I would like to have it in front
of me and everybody knows what's coming

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.199
up

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.030
it's on the wall exactly see you should
choose one that large enough to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.690
accommodate

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.630
all your family's needs and hanging in a
central location

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.720
I think color coding is great that at a
glance you'd be able to see that

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.140
I whoever's are and has this going on
today you just attach it right there in

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.250
oh yeah hand if you can hang these
markers by

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.210
strengthen anyone can add to the
calendar whenever something new comes up

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.799
okay much bigger calendar you have
inspired me my little one has gotta go

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.380
now

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.619
and before school now this in my house
is the most stressful time of the day

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.729
in the morning everyone to running
around very hectic where's my backpack

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.780
wheres my lunch

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.890
what is your tip to make it much

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.829
easier time of day well you know
mornings are hectic and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.409
things get lost in the shuffle and I
think that it's always a good idea to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.439
teach children to plan ahead for things

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.729
so if you could start tournament evening
routine

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.380
where the kids gather their homework
assignment anything special they might

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.090
need for school the next day like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.340
team uniform or a band instrument other

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.570
on one place so that it's ready to go in
the morning once they got a bad you can

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.149
do a little prep work yourself

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.209
had to the kitchen pack their lunch put
it in the fridge

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.250
and then they just have to grab it in
the morning go so much easier for

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.000
everybody

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.849
okay see you recommend zones having his
own setup for each child with their

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.780
supplies and backpacks tell us what

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.319
we should have been this is the cell
writes his own okay for your son and

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.540
your daughter nowhere

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.700
what you have here well like I just said
if you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.170
pack the bags the night before they
should go someplace I love a space that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.459
encourages efficiency

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.450
it doesn't have to be elaborate with
that one up here with toobin

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.750
okay they should be placed as close to
the door as possible

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
okay we get the lunch box we got the
last laugh that their backpacks and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.190
their

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.980
here ready to go ready to go they would
just go to their been in the morning

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.129
grab what's in there

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.010
and get out the door another thing I
like are these Hawks

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.030
that you can hang kid level such a great
idea

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.700
they can get their own stuff and be
responsible for stealth a little more

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.430
about that well you know the over the
door once was actually work here cuz

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.150
kids can't reach that high up so if you
get one of these petcock that go

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.420
directly into the wall then they can
hang their backpacks their jackets their

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.280
sweatshirts and you're not in charge of
that anymore I love that idea

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.790
that's perfect perfect for me and you
know one another big problem is in my

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.190
house

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.980
is in the mornings my daughter getting
dressed picking out ten different

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.750
outfits doesn't know what to wear

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.840
what can we do to cut down on that well

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.220
you can't do it all on Sunday night you
know you never have to hear mom I have

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.930
nothing to wear

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.140
again if on a Sunday night you sit down
with your daughter and you choose five

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.290
outfits for the week

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.299
yourself a sweater hanging bag have
sorta five compartments and they can

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.430
hang in the calls right

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.430
if you assign de ti each compartment on
Monday morning

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.599
your daughter knows to go to the Monday
slot grab the clothes

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.080
get dressed and come down for breakfast
that makes everything so much easier I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.180
love that idea

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.750
organic we're gonna start on that before
school starts that's that's when she get

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.299
started

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.970
okay finally there are so many things to
remember these

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.989
always slipped my mind the permission
for for the field trip the

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.810
money you need for lunch all these
little things that you forget

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.079
what a good way to keep organized with
that well when it comes to the papers to

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.389
come and the permission slips the
notices

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.750
it's a really great idea to get your
kids in the habit eventing

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.830
bad for this thing absolutely happen in
one

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.240
designated spot 30 it could be a
bulletin board

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.460
it could be in outbox when they get home
emptied the bag

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.770
about the papers that mami to stay after
they go to bed you can sort through it

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.900
if it needs your signature sign it and
stick it in there been so that they know

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.440
to take it with them in the morning

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.880
sales find it on Monday morning when are
putting their stuff in it what a great

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.729
