00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:12.809
 Hello everyone, we will be cooking very 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.670
 tasty and satisfying and yet 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.319
 relatively dietary it 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:27.249
 rabbit stew in wine and with garlic and 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:31.980
 so he for that on the rabbit carcass I 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:35.739
 cut into pieces like that here 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:44.710
 curls ie 2 bunnies mean 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:50.710
 now we need pepper salt vegetable 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:54.810
 oil a little white dry wine in 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:01:01.870
 as seasoning we will use 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:06.549
 basil and killers and thyme also 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.609
 need 1 carrot and here it is 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.390
 amount of garlic 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:15.549
 here it will need a lot well and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 a little pinch of coriander still here 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:28.859
 added will also give such a pleasant aroma 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:32.100
 and so in our dishes at the bottom pour . 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.100
 forgot to open 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.180
 means in our dishes pour 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:49.040
 cooking oil so that she 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:53.680
 covered the whole area 2 is enough so 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.049
 this oil needs to be reheated well and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:04.009
 then we put our meat in there 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:06.860
 while our oils are warming up and chopped 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.489
 carrot so basically not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.510
 thin slices of garlic until cut 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.360
 I won't because 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.040
 we will add almost to the very 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.989
 the end 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.030
 during roasting and visa te it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.239
 accordingly it will be so even that he is not 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.010
 exhausted and so oil spilled 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.819
 I put us our rabbit in the pot 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.030
 Now 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.030
 it is necessary to salt it well 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.530
 one by one hand unfortunately doing it 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.170
 uncomfortable and immediately ground ancestors 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.439
 tame I think the process will take off 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 not necessary 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:59.709
 so we look further we are promising generously 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.769
 because meat is autumn chim speed 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.049
 bead salt and pepper to taste 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.390
 but now we need on a big fire on 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.519
 maximum temperature 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.739
 mix the whole thing thoroughly 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.250
 bring to such a light golden 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.269
 crusts 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.500
 so that from all sides every piece up to 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.510
 slightly roasted then we will 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.170
 keep adding ours there 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.170
 Ingredients 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.950
 everything 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.860
 add our carrot added and 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.250
 carrot all this carefully exceeded 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.400
 need to evaporate the alcohol and the link in general so 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.890
 as 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.950
 will stop and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.630
 such a distinct smell of alcohol 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.340
 reduce the fire cover the lid and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.740
 the whole thing with a shower draw people 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.730
 This is how our rabbit looks like later. 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 about 40 minutes we put out 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.220
 at this time we have it several times 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.070
 stirred and so I chopped garlic 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.140
 that's about slices now the most 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.160
 time 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.419
 pour it our pot and in 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.150
