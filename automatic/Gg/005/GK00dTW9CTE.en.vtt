00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.009
 hallesche together and welcome 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.880
 Back on my bike singlespeed 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.280
 glock yes as we see the bike drives 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.910
 still as we see is the recording 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 already august so much later and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.340
 the bike is still in the end today 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 september in the video we just see 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.189
 made a full stop because car has 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 overlook me and ticket yourself 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.439
 watch out whoever is dead that's it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.160
 Dangerous with the partner and will be happy 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.670
 So overlook the bike back 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 it runs smoothly it runs fast 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 through the thin mature mettmann 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 really a speed advantage 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 are opposite my old bike 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.899
 really when you drive over 30 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 it hardly resisted sooner or at 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.960
 bike with thick tires but really great 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.989
 So it's hard to drive 30 35 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.480
 problems 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.949
 yes i just let run briefly so that you 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 let's hear the sound how it goes 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.200
 that is fine I have had so far 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.200
 no plates everything nice everything great 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.280
 The guy behind me with his single 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.860
 speed bike probably has 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.840
 my group is seen around a bike and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.510
 he he entered his pedals 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.040
 Although what so now I could turn could 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 but I was able to overtake him 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.240
 not bad 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.860
 In addition one is addressed really often 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.259
 that I have a good bike that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 already a great feeling when building a car 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.900
 as we just heard was the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.910
 chain still very loud in the next 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.710
 that lasts three to 100 kilometers 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.610
 problem because the lubricants are still 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.630
 not quite in the chain links 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.400
 are retracted 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.440
 just now I have a brake test 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.070
 The tires are very good, too 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.990
 in the rain 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670
 the rolling resistance is very low and 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.140
 I'm already through the shards 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.150
 no plates crossed 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.320
 these are the grand prix 4000 of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.580
 continental which are expensive though 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.450
 really good 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.280
 made in germany of course you believe 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.960
 not how hard that is too much 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 Anyway, I still have a postcard 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.600
 made inlin with Berlin 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.210
 Now we see the inside view, so to speak 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.880
 the top view on the handlebars 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.010
 Handlebar grips are now ocean road 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.430
 and thank you for watching me 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 to forget
