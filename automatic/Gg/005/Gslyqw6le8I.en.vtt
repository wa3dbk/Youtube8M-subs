you<00:02:18.130> know<00:02:18.250> they<00:02:18.400> were<00:02:18.459> asking<00:02:19.180> me<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.900> do

something that custom had reconciled

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.990 
something that custom had reconciled
them<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.840> saw<00:02:23.319> as<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.680> most<00:02:24.400> extreme

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
them to but I saw as the most extreme

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880 
them to but I saw as the most extreme
and<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.840> most<00:02:26.019> violent<00:02:26.530> of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
and the most violent of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.160 
and the most violent of
all<00:02:27.010> possible<00:02:27.640> responses<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.780> that's<00:02:28.930> put

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
all possible responses and that's put

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.140 
all possible responses and that's put
them<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.470> death<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.460> weren't<00:02:30.670> even<00:02:31.030> going

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
them to death so we weren't even going

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.120 
them to death so we weren't even going
to<00:02:31.209> have<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.780> conversation<00:02:32.530> whether<00:02:32.709> killing

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
to have the conversation whether killing

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.920 
to have the conversation whether killing
was<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:33.700> resort<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.569> know<00:02:34.690> when<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
was the first resort you know when the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.020 
was the first resort you know when the
cages<00:02:35.290> get<00:02:35.440> full<00:02:35.709> or<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> last<00:02:36.430> resort<00:02:36.760> when

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
cages get full or the last resort when

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.820 
cages get full or the last resort when
we<00:02:37.270> run<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> options<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.380> was<00:02:38.500> going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> be

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
we run out of options it was going to be

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.580 
we run out of options it was going to be
no<00:02:38.860> resort<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:40.270> when<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.600> take<00:02:40.870> killing<00:02:41.380> off

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
no resort and when you take killing off

all been proven false just the simple
one<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.720> know<00:05:37.840> there's<00:05:38.020> too<00:05:38.229> many<00:05:38.380> animals

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
one of you know there's too many animals

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.830 
one of you know there's too many animals
and<00:05:39.130> not<00:05:39.220> enough<00:05:39.580> homes<00:05:39.850> if<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.510> were<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.780> ask

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
and not enough homes if you were to ask

of the animals and their shelters

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.850 
of the animals and their shelters
so<00:05:46.449> you're<00:05:46.600> arguing<00:05:47.139> that<00:05:47.289> there<00:05:47.500> is<00:05:47.650> this

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
so you're arguing that there is this

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.760 
so you're arguing that there is this
supply-demand<00:05:48.850> imbalance<00:05:49.500> what<00:05:50.500> is<00:05:50.620> the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
supply-demand imbalance what is the

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.439 
supply-demand imbalance what is the
supply<00:05:51.130> they<00:05:51.370> can<00:05:51.550> tell<00:05:51.729> you<00:05:51.880> that<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.300> that's

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
supply they can tell you that and that's

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.120 
supply they can tell you that and that's
the<00:05:52.660> number<00:05:52.930> of<00:05:52.990> animals<00:05:53.259> that<00:05:53.440> are<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.979> they

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
the number of animals that are that they

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.339 
the number of animals that are that they
kill<00:05:54.340> every<00:05:54.580> year<00:05:54.789> what<00:05:55.360> is<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.660> demand<00:05:55.990> for

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
kill every year what is the demand for

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.779 
kill every year what is the demand for
animals<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:56.949> mean<00:05:57.099> if<00:05:57.220> you're<00:05:57.370> going<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.580> argue

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
animals I mean if you're going to argue

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.850 
animals I mean if you're going to argue
a<00:05:58.000> supply-demand<00:05:58.509> imbalance<00:05:59.080> too<00:05:59.680> many

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
another commercial source but what we

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.760 
another commercial source but what we
found<00:06:50.979> is<00:06:51.280> that<00:06:51.310> about<00:06:51.699> 17<00:06:52.360> million<00:06:52.810> people

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
found is that about 17 million people

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.279 
found is that about 17 million people
have<00:06:54.520> not<00:06:54.729> decided<00:06:55.210> where<00:06:55.990> they're<00:06:56.139> going<00:06:56.259> to

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
have not decided where they're going to

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.890 
have not decided where they're going to
get<00:06:56.440> their<00:06:56.500> next<00:06:56.770> animal<00:06:57.280> from<00:06:57.550> and<00:06:57.940> surveys

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
get their next animal from and surveys

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.540 
get their next animal from and surveys
show<00:06:59.080> that<00:06:59.110> they<00:06:59.440> can<00:06:59.770> be<00:06:59.949> influenced<00:07:00.490> to

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
show that they can be influenced to

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.339 
show that they can be influenced to
adopt<00:07:00.820> from<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:01.090> shelter<00:07:01.330> and<00:07:01.690> so<00:07:01.900> the

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
adopt from a shelter and so the

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.379 
adopt from a shelter and so the
challenge<00:07:02.590> it<00:07:03.039> isn't<00:07:03.520> about<00:07:03.610> too<00:07:04.270> many

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
challenge it isn't about too many

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.810 
challenge it isn't about too many
animals<00:07:04.900> not<00:07:05.050> of<00:07:05.229> homes<00:07:05.469> the<00:07:05.710> challenges<00:07:06.280> one

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
animals not of homes the challenges one
