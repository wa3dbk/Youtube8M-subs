00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.850
 Hello friends today I bring you my youtube 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.800
 first pancake and pasta with loquendo 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.660
 remember that it is my first crepe and 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.219
 pasta so it can not be that good 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.219
 Now, let's start 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.060
 metals rain one day as always 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.790
 I was bored and I thought about buying a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 game I went to the store but I did not 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.980
 and it was also interested in anything so expensive 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.020
 that I returned to my house di solved 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 until he gave me the idea of downloading a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.910
 I play for my computer but it was the same 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.220
 all bits were not good they were down 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 they had viruses until I found a 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.350
 page that said neither a metal slug that in 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 Spanish means new metal slug like 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.699
 I was a fan of this saga, do not hesitate 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 downloading the page was a bit 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.199
 strange was the black background with 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 red spots and even below said something 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.210
 but it was not understood I did not give 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.519
 importance and discharge when started 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.150
 the download could not give him or cancel 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.489
 pause all of a sudden he said he weighed 666 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.680
 gigabytes I got scared but then it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 happened to a gigabyte I got quiet 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 but not by much when I opened it by 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 true it was an ecce I heard a scream but 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 I thought it was from the house next door when 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.540
 start the title said 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.660
 metals cloud that in Spanish means 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.640
 dead light metals or something like that x from I thought 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.950
 that was a name that attracted attention 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.170
 so I did not owe importance when I was going to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.180
 choose the character was chosen only to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.100
 tarma how did you know the game that was my 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.190
 favorite character but then when 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.869
 started it looked like metal slug x only 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.330
 that more difficult and instead of soldiers 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.520
 of green color were red and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.650
 When they died they shouted and it seemed that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.080
 screams were from the other side when I arrived 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.759
 in the end there was no final boss but he 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.430
 he saw that the soldiers ran out 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 the screen was distorted and put on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.800
 black like for a minute then 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 he returned the image and said that the mission 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.649
 666 had started in place of the mission 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.930
 two 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.270
 I said web the fuck that mission was 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 very rare the red background and there was only one 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.100
 straight road without obstacles or enemies 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.980
 but by advancing they saw soldiers 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 dead disemboweled with realistic blood 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
 and there were shouts from far away I was 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.910
 scaring a lot when it came to the end 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.160
 the character stopped he could not 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.710
 control died without any reason 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.350
 and I saw that they came as zombies almost 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.660
 realistic to my character and they were 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.300
 eating but all realistic with the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.490
 organs left I was very disgusted then 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.430
 the computer restarted but without 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.750
 no reason on the screen said know 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 your turn that in Spanish means now 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.060
 it's your turn I got really scared and left 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.640
 running from my house take a breath and always 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.250
 when I'm sleeping at school in 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.280
 free time all the time he heard 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.310
 a whisper that says why because 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.780
 you have done and from there you heard screams 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.240
 chilling from that time I 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.080
 trauma with metal slug and never ever what 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.080
 I will play again 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.440

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.810

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.210
