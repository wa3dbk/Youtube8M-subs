 there I started as a matrix for 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 suffered some in 2004 as but sad in 3d would be sent to vpn 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.200
 she then I worked would 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.619

 a three dj nation when I enrolled in school be spvm has 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.420
 in the business lately that one could site relatively easily 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.560
 find work 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.830
 and she can have 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 a creative side that is still very strong 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.160
 the big part of this work to give up all the movements and gallimard 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.890
 the movement is still not been duped senate any time by knowledge 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 so all the movements are cut into small pieces does that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.260
 it's stupid stationery at quick is super important and it's not cheap 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 to everyone it's actually it's a lot of partial work side 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.130
 recipes it is very important but you must always look for a little 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 little further and to communicate our needs and scare the teams 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 programming a little head at the beginning of the week we talk with 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.640
 different trades vegetable arenas 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 % and loans she's fed up 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.950
 the head of equipped animations is done around a table and then look there 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.450
 the task he had to do 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.399
 so we really make him an asset of all the animations that suck r 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.890
 deal in fact to be realized movement there is an exchange then 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.760
 we animate 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.310
 a first by this way a little bit more 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.259
 the euro ended at 6 years old at that time voices are expected to margin later the 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.560
 federation in the game when we look at what movement the aspect 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.329
 specific to him and what's enough that's scary anyway 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.270
 quickly 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.760
 and then to China is getting more work this morning than the 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.140
 movement be complete federate 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.300
 this is the morning damask banana frame a place a lot of sense of observation 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.470
 apple goes in what we like are humans 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.599
 % what is important is the ump 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.270
 to develop in the proper sense and that of taking the time 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.270
 became the mom she was working would 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.789
 what is really interested in the basics is to look at everything that is 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:25.349
 made 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.359
 and then to actually be able to choose his voice because the winger of 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.450
 celtics without maybe this samsung crash is an example alone 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 and go that but would specialize mandanda the motion capture in these 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.160
 fines to find out a little what makes us sense can not find in school 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.189
 we can not find 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.429
 it's by doing that my mother specializing over the years 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.519
 of those who would like to do 3D animation is presently for this 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.349
 CV of Beaucourt Kerber 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.060
 for that what is done naturally in 3d animation time passes less 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.870
 of effect look at me time you have not without fears people play at 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.519
 video games look how it actually works how saleh agites 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.089
 a system that which constrains the real question anger lol 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.309
 for this match there were a lot of favorites and in fact keep amara 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.839
 do a brief bankruptcy look 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.709
 a little how it works it's not a nation in a few years 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.139
 previous licensing staps incentive at ease facing this 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.409
 what was the hope 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.879
 already before entering school I had an idea of ​​what it is and 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.959
 even though I do not have the words for msi young I had not taken his 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.069
 health 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.719
 walk strictly speaking show us to his friends who I say that I 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.589
 know but only drawn 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.919
 ah yes finally and by a certain spirit and the 3d is less and less of 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.069
 requests for help or demand to make it the voice of deputies pc scenes and his 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.419
 worth starting 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.649
 for all that is preparation both 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.029
 to start what's called the blank page that revealed that a desire to 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:55.769
 start itchy and really fears a landscape starts with the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.340
 chapter one year is already it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.140
 cut and so it starts very commented by saha part of the middle 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 could be a hindrance to the woman that ends as already serves actually 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.860
 the more we do the same thing for a business 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.960
 I would like to keep everyone moving all the time in all been conducted 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.869
 in turn makes us just 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.559
