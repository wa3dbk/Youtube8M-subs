00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and I'm quite I'm you know I'm quite

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.689 
and I'm quite I'm you know I'm quite
technically<00:00:53.190> minded<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:54.270> programming<00:00:54.960> PHP

they<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> guarantee<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.480> what<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
they have a guarantee and what did you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880 
they have a guarantee and what did you
do<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.699> somewhere<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.890> basically

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
do I think it's somewhere here basically

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
do I think it's somewhere here basically
they<00:01:05.400> SAT<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> satisfaction

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
they SAT they got a satisfaction

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770 
they SAT they got a satisfaction
guarantee<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.880> doesn't<00:01:09.180> seem<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> work

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
