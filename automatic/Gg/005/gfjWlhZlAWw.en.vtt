00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
tamiya think this is perfect because the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.170 
tamiya think this is perfect because the
other<00:02:55.800> brush<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.190> around<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.850> kind<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.090> get

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
like a circle motion I guess I that that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.160 
like a circle motion I guess I that that
kind<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.210> brush<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.480> good<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.020> put
