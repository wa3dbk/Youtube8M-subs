00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.390 
me this you looked like the tottering on
the<00:03:46.750> edge<00:03:46.840> there<00:03:47.110> well<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.799> does<00:03:47.950> present<00:03:48.100> its

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the edge there well it does present its

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.069 
the edge there well it does present its
own<00:03:48.519> challenges<00:03:49.030> most<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.570> all<00:03:49.630> we've<00:03:49.780> got<00:03:49.900> two

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
own challenges most of all we've got two

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.870 
own challenges most of all we've got two
and<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.260> half<00:03:50.410> miles<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.950> unfazed<00:03:51.340> cliff<00:03:51.609> around

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
and a half miles of unfazed cliff around

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.699 
and a half miles of unfazed cliff around
the<00:03:52.000> edge<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.480> think<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:52.989> people<00:03:53.019> forget<00:03:53.380> is

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
the edge I think what people forget is

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.130 
the edge I think what people forget is
that<00:03:53.739> all<00:03:54.160> dogs<00:03:54.459> are<00:03:54.609> chased<00:03:54.850> sheep<00:03:55.140> unless

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
that all dogs are chased sheep unless

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.599 
that all dogs are chased sheep unless
they've<00:03:56.350> been<00:03:56.500> proven<00:03:56.709> not<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.070> they<00:03:57.370> will

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
they've been proven not to they will

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.920 
they've been proven not to they will
it's<00:03:58.120> their<00:03:58.269> basic<00:03:58.690> instinct<00:03:59.260> now

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
it's their basic instinct now

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.449 
it's their basic instinct now
yeah<00:04:00.049> obviously<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.650> chase<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.069> sheep<00:04:01.310> it

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
yeah obviously the chase of the sheep it

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.920 
yeah obviously the chase of the sheep it
ends<00:04:01.579> up<00:04:01.760> going<00:04:01.939> downhill<00:04:02.209> with<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.569> cliff<00:04:02.810> at

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
ends up going downhill with a cliff at

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.959 
ends up going downhill with a cliff at
the<00:04:02.989> bottom<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:04.069> can<00:04:04.250> have<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.670> fairly

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
the bottom and that can have a fairly

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.179 
the bottom and that can have a fairly
serious<00:04:05.239> results<00:04:05.870> sheep<00:04:06.439> either<00:04:06.650> gets<00:04:06.920> stuck

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
serious results sheep either gets stuck

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.970 
serious results sheep either gets stuck
or<00:04:07.459> we<00:04:07.849> lose<00:04:08.090> about<00:04:08.299> five<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:09.079> six<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.739> year<00:04:09.769> I
