really suggest buying something that's

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.540 
really suggest buying something that's
kind<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.230> expensive<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.100> don't<00:03:51.430> know

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
kind of expensive because you don't know

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.250 
kind of expensive because you don't know

if it's fake or not so that's the actual

if it's fake or not so that's the actual
satellite<00:03:54.190> speaker<00:03:54.910> which<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.840> pretty<00:03:56.019> cool

gigabytes which is a lot or again I know
a<00:04:39.590> lot<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.950> gonna<00:04:40.130> be<00:04:40.220> like<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.400> don't

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
a lot of you gonna be like you don't

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.420 
a lot of you gonna be like you don't
need<00:04:40.700> anymore<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.920> rendering<00:04:42.920> still<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
need anymore but rendering still is a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.190 
need anymore but rendering still is a
bit<00:04:43.640> slow<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:43.910> me<00:04:44.180> when<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.390> make<00:04:44.600> kind<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.960> lot

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
bit slow for me when I make kind of lot

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.110 
bit slow for me when I make kind of lot
longer<00:04:45.440> video<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.100> need<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.550> put<00:04:46.880> some<00:04:47.030> more

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
longer video so I need to put some more

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.570 
longer video so I need to put some more
RAM<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.480> maybe<00:04:48.110> get<00:04:48.290> up<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.440> 32<00:04:48.860> think<00:04:49.430> that's

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
RAM in maybe get up to 32 think that's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.160 
RAM in maybe get up to 32 think that's
what<00:04:49.670> I'm<00:04:49.730> gonna<00:04:49.820> do<00:04:50.000> anyway<00:04:50.600> these<00:04:50.930> are<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
what I'm gonna do anyway these are the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.410 
what I'm gonna do anyway these are the
ones<00:04:51.380> with<00:04:51.590> V<00:04:51.800> little<00:04:52.100> volume<00:04:52.310> controls<00:04:52.790> so

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
ones with V little volume controls so

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.300 
ones with V little volume controls so
that's<00:04:53.750> more<00:04:54.380> that's<00:04:54.740> less<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.070> think<00:04:55.250> these

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
that's more that's less I think these

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.920 
that's more that's less I think these
are<00:04:55.370> tough<00:04:55.670> -<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.150> don't<00:04:56.360> know<00:04:56.450> I<00:04:56.480> need<00:04:56.720> touch

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
are tough - I don't know I need touch

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.360 
are tough - I don't know I need touch
map<00:04:57.140> but<00:04:57.350> they<00:04:57.410> don't<00:04:57.590> click<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:57.950> so<00:04:58.070> they<00:04:58.160> have

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
map but they don't click in so they have

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.160 
map but they don't click in so they have
to<00:04:58.520> be<00:04:58.640> touched

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
to be touched

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.450 
to be touched
so<00:05:00.170> yeah<00:05:00.320> they<00:05:00.560> do<00:05:00.620> exactly<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.100> same<00:05:01.130> thing

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
so yeah they do exactly the same thing

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.670 
so yeah they do exactly the same thing
they<00:05:01.610> go<00:05:01.760> back<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.540> forward<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.350> think<00:05:03.620> I'm

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
they go back and forward so I think I'm

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
they go back and forward so I think I'm
gonna<00:05:03.770> keep<00:05:03.950> them<00:05:04.070> like<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.340> when<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.520> put

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
gonna keep them like that when I put

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:14.800 
gonna keep them like that when I put
them<00:05:04.820> up<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.850> is<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> little<00:05:14.360> power<00:05:14.540> block

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
them up and this is a little power block

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.000 
them up and this is a little power block
thingy<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.740> guessing<00:05:16.700> that's<00:05:16.880> for<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:18.440> back

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
thingy so guessing that's for the back

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.260 
thingy so guessing that's for the back
of<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.310> front<00:05:19.640> to<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.660> power<00:05:21.850> pretty<00:05:22.850> standard

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
of it front to the power pretty standard

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.690 
of it front to the power pretty standard
pretty<00:05:23.870> big<00:05:24.020> what<00:05:24.200> it<00:05:24.320> is<00:05:24.410> pretty<00:05:25.340> cool<00:05:25.520> though

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
pretty big what it is pretty cool though

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.270 
pretty big what it is pretty cool though
anyway<00:05:26.420> that<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.440> pretty<00:05:27.620> much<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.830> guys<00:05:28.070> it's

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
anyway that is pretty much it guys it's

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.100 
anyway that is pretty much it guys it's
gonna<00:05:28.760> keep<00:05:28.880> quite<00:05:29.120> short<00:05:29.330> because<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:30.050> know

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
gonna keep quite short because I know

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.110 
gonna keep quite short because I know
you've<00:05:30.830> probably<00:05:30.890> seen<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.310> meaning<00:05:31.880> some

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
you've probably seen this meaning some

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.330 
you've probably seen this meaning some
well<00:05:32.390> but<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.630> thought<00:05:32.870> I'd<00:05:33.020> make<00:05:33.200> one<00:05:33.380> so<00:05:33.740> there

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
well but I thought I'd make one so there

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.960 
well but I thought I'd make one so there
is<00:05:34.630> carbon-carbon<00:05:35.630> sound<00:05:35.870> six<00:05:36.110> three<00:05:36.440> and

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
is carbon-carbon sound six three and

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.060 
is carbon-carbon sound six three and
when<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.000> put<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.570> all<00:05:38.660> together<00:05:38.810> hook<00:05:39.740> up<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:39.980> my

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
when I put it all together hook up to my

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.950 
when I put it all together hook up to my
computer<00:05:40.130> I'll<00:05:40.790> probably<00:05:41.060> make<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.510> little

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
computer I'll probably make a little

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.100 
computer I'll probably make a little
comparison<00:05:42.620> testing<00:05:43.490> thing<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:44.960> show

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
comparison testing thing just to show

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.990 
comparison testing thing just to show
you<00:05:45.170> how<00:05:45.410> good<00:05:45.710> there<00:05:45.890> yeah<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.640> thank<00:05:46.940> you
