and the only thing it does hinder is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289

sort<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> casual<00:01:50.549> listening<00:01:50.909> say<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
sort of casual listening say if you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
sort of casual listening say if you

wanted to listen to it out and about and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
wanted to listen to it out and about and
that<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.540> long<00:01:54.750> cable<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.439> have

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that it is a very long cable so you have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
that it is a very long cable so you have
to<00:01:56.009> sort<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.570> coil<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.170> bag<00:01:58.320> or

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
something but it's not an issue because

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.959 
something but it's not an issue because
these<00:02:00.719> aren't<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.409> meant<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.820> there<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
these aren't really meant for there so a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
these aren't really meant for there so a
casual<00:02:03.479> listening<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> things<00:02:04.829> like

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079

and one thing I want to talk about is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.869 
and one thing I want to talk about is
the<00:03:41.580> MV<00:03:42.330> r7<00:03:43.140> 506<00:03:43.890> mmm<00:03:44.610> excuse<00:03:45.090> me<00:03:45.290> which<00:03:46.879> you

the MV r7 506 mmm excuse me which you

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.430 
the MV r7 506 mmm excuse me which you
may<00:03:48.299> have<00:03:48.420> noticed<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:48.989> look<00:03:49.140> at<00:03:49.260> their

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
may have noticed if you look at their

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.309 
may have noticed if you look at their
terms<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.830> very<00:03:50.129> similar<00:03:50.489> model<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.120> this

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
terms is a very similar model to this

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.899 
terms is a very similar model to this
they<00:03:52.319> look<00:03:52.500> exactly<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.069> same<00:03:53.189> apart<00:03:53.760> from

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
they look exactly the same apart from

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.119 
they look exactly the same apart from
the<00:03:54.060> red<00:03:54.239> sticker<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.930> blue<00:03:55.409> on<00:03:55.439> them<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
the red sticker is blue on them and it

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.890 
the red sticker is blue on them and it
doesn't<00:03:56.430> take<00:03:56.580> for<00:03:56.790> digital<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.390> think<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.780> says

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
doesn't take for digital I think it says

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.740 
doesn't take for digital I think it says
something<00:03:57.930> else<00:03:58.349> I'm<00:03:59.010> not<00:03:59.189> sure<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.450> stats

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
something else I'm not sure the stats

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.710 
something else I'm not sure the stats
though<00:04:01.080> very<00:04:01.980> very<00:04:02.280> similar<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.150> frequency

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
though very very similar the frequency

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.100 
though very very similar the frequency
response<00:04:04.319> for<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.730> 75006<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.939> stated<00:04:06.330> as<00:04:06.480> 10

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110

to 20,000 Hertz which is slightly

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.809 
to 20,000 Hertz which is slightly
different<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:10.560> game<00:04:10.769> won't<00:04:11.640> make<00:04:11.790> a

different the game won't make a

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.360 
different the game won't make a
difference<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:13.590> probably<00:04:13.950> notice<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
difference and you probably notice the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.430

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
price for the 7 506 is quite a bit more

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.870 
price for the 7 506 is quite a bit more
in<00:04:16.500> some<00:04:16.739> cases<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.370> because<00:04:17.699> it's

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
in some cases and that's because it's

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.170 
in some cases and that's because it's
aimed

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
don't think you'd know is the difference

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
between the v6 and the 75006 myself so I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.730 
between the v6 and the 75006 myself so I
would<00:04:44.699> recommend<00:04:45.120> these<00:04:45.240> over<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> e75<00:04:46.199> 36

you're in the studio that's what you

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.150 
you're in the studio that's what you
need<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:12.449> you<00:05:12.570> monitoring<00:05:13.229> with<00:05:13.410> them<00:05:13.620> don't

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
need if you monitoring with them don't

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.830

possible<00:05:22.520> there's<00:05:23.520> quite<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.789> difference<00:05:23.880> in

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
possible there's quite a difference in

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.439
