00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.540
 gidon's release feed reincarnation late 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 for a month 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.690
 and all because the developers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 excited that they get something 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 not quite working and took a reprieve 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 promising everything up to go fix in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 In the end, the toy still came out and not quite 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 it is clear what that month was spent 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 so we took the liberty 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 do about also paused 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 for a few weeks 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 relying on the life-giving packs and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 at least raise tps to acceptable 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 level then you can show the game 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.059
 Well, let's say with a smooth video series, but 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 we were raped in this case too gi dong 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.899
 ren gherkin has remained terribly 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 unoptimized retarding parody 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.940
 on one of the best games of all time and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940
 peoples 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.739
 cool west and it seems cramped that 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.809
 flowed into reincarnation without critical 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.610
 changes already right in the menu the person starts 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.350
 involuntarily crooked in likeness 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.840
 branded smiles but now finally 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 ride suppress all these carcasses 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.130
 smash cars and enemies muahaha 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.880
 in fact, in the future, it is about all 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.860
 that's what happens 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.420
 probably especially for newfagov worth 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 tell more in detail what is there at all 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.140
 the affair and where is the immense fan lurking in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.280
 that to the magicians done she always was 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.619
 not about racing at all 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.899
 that is, the track is even checkpoints there 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.580
 circles and all that but essentially you could 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.590
 generally score on it and have fun on 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.810
 full coil because as options whether 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.460
 crazy pastime is enough 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.830
 for example, you can crush numerous 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.869
 passers-by will be blood screams panic 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.300
 pieces of scattering flesh general beauty 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.220
 incredible and voice of encouragement 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.409
 fully justifying everything here 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.300
 going on also kindly informing about 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.770
 any bonuses that you get for 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.050
 for example, multiple killings 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.429
 collect scattered barrels here and there 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.619
 with all sorts of extra chips 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.509
 for example forcing people to rush 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.909
 back and forth hysterical or vice versa 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.829
 let's freeze bonuses you can get 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.689
 by the way and for example for free wheelbarrows 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.640
 repair or some killer crap 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.709
 type of constant bouncing in place 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.399
 or here on the tail sypanut huge hole 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.380
 with spikes 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.480
 and then smash and machine the enemies to 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.370
 completely forgot this, too, in priority 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.739
 defeat everyone just by eliminating 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 there are no cars and thereâ€™s no problem 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.780
 it is said ram shoot down to catch up and I 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.610
 give more fan frenzy well this is me 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.920
 old memory as they say but in deed 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.570
 everything is far from fun 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.340
 the problem is it seems to me to 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.840
 artificial constraints which 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.180
 imposed by the players themselves 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.519
 developers see for example 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.170
 there is a single player campaign this by which 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.420
 unlocked using earned 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 races points more than the results of the race 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.140
 collected the more will fall into a common piggy bank 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 and, accordingly, the sooner they will become 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.549
 available new locations for races 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.380
 details for the machine and so on the problem in 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.570
 That to convey to drag her in every possible way 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.739
 deliver how much life it decent 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.750
 amount to finish 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.640
 turns out to be a big problem cars 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.290
 steel just cardboard develop after 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.180
 every spit and repair is perfect 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.739
 unjustifiably became doroguschy while 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.109
 earn their points as a result 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.419
 knocking down the same pedestrians or eliminating 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.600
 other cars barely barely enough for 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.430
 way out of this minus 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.140
 went somewhere according to the results of repairs so 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.300
 it turns out you have to pereprohodit 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.430
 re- existing rides sometimes not even 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.110
 once and do it neatly 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.960
 which in itself is just incomprehensible to the mind 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.430
 when it comes to gidon food and everything 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.740
 do not care how many people you crushed 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.240
 how many tricks did the main thing get 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.040
 first goalies to the finish 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.620
 then earned coins thoughtfully 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.120
 will drag off and add to the overall achievement in 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.460
 as a result, the passage is delayed and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.440
 bored with matukha on cards starts 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.120
 rather even annoy and giving back money 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 for the next repair and convulsively 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.150
 pretend that to unlock 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.070
 the next stage is not enough and 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.110
 will have to go through this race again 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.970
 reminds some kind of milk fritupley 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.590
 hydrochloric farm with gamers that's just the difference in the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.540
 the fact that they ask for the game normal such 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.400
 money as for the full final so far 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.050
 version and that might be wrong 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.970
 too bad to work on 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.460
 optimized to have removed these ridiculous 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.970
 restrictions oval hung ear pokatushki 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.620
 ready to remind you that she is reincarnated 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.970
 The authors of the original feed gi do 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.310
 raised money on a kickstarter 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.350
 actually themselves volunteered themselves 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.270
 set but in the end the release version is not 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.130
 so seriously different from pre-alpha 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.320
 Well, that is, it is clear that the toy three seams 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.610
 all the fields and hypertrophied but 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.930
 also should not affect 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.120
 frames per second you and 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.770
 comfortable passing opportunities i'm not 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 of those who will cry on the graphon in and 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.470
 that it is not on the rink 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.210
 i just want to play comfortably 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.860
 merry feed gi do battleship Nation 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.100
 it is a pity that the developers with me in this 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.600
 Of course, all who paid 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.310
 continue to argue on numerous 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 thematic forums that everything is cool 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.230
 and that all major clean in front and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.210
 Of course, if you are among those who gave 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.220
 you can look for your pros and cons 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.170
 the races are still pretty funny no matter how 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.120
 cool yes and the music is just fine and 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.800
 here you can still just ride out 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.330
 field and crush athletes who 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.070
 I think that playing in two is really 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.360
 really just run a bird in the hands of those not 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.340
 less is not enough for 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.320
 triumphant multiplayer return 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 empty so single gets off with these 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.680
 constant pereprohozhdenii and not 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.390
 opportunities to move forward in the same 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.310
 crazy pace trying to ask 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.020
 the game itself though sometimes with tempo too 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.790
 big problems but even if the batman 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.500
 did not work well and do not know at all 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.210
 I just want to scream at times 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.509
 question to go 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.520
 but in general prohodnyak from us and quite 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.620
 deserved my condolences to those 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.419
 gave money for it but itâ€™s possible 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.280
 what ever we will win sagging 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.720
 fps and get together in multiplayer in 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.580
 some crazy friday 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.319
