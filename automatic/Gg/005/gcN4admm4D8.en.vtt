00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.279 

so<00:00:20.660> we're<00:00:21.590> doing<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.920> first<00:00:22.070> step<00:00:22.430> in<00:00:22.910> our<00:00:25.029> 3v

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
so we're doing the first step in our 3v

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.670 
so we're doing the first step in our 3v
four-ninths<00:00:27.320> also<00:00:28.310> known<00:00:28.489> as<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.640> 3/8<00:00:29.180> dough

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
four-ninths also known as a 3/8 dough

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.490 
four-ninths also known as a 3/8 dough
and<00:00:30.680> we're<00:00:31.550> cutting<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.910> boards<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.390> size<00:00:32.660> so

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
and we're cutting the boards to size so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.040 
and we're cutting the boards to size so
this<00:00:33.860> will<00:00:34.070> be<00:00:34.220> one<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.550> struts<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.720> cut

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
this will be one of the a struts we cut

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.500 
this will be one of the a struts we cut
the<00:00:36.850> B<00:00:37.850> struts<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.769> C<00:00:39.980> stress<00:00:40.510> labeling

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
the B struts and the C stress labeling

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920 
the B struts and the C stress labeling
them<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:41.900> we<00:00:42.519> keep<00:00:43.519> them<00:00:43.760> straight<00:00:44.089> so<00:00:44.629> when<00:00:44.809> we

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
them so we keep them straight so when we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.619 
them so we keep them straight so when we
put<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.260> angles<00:00:45.620> on<00:00:45.800> them<00:00:46.390> know<00:00:47.390> what<00:00:47.510> we're

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
put the angles on them know what we're

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.420 
put the angles on them know what we're
doing<00:00:47.900> making<00:00:48.470> sure<00:00:48.769> we<00:00:48.920> angle<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.309> right

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
doing making sure we angle the right

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.450 
doing making sure we angle the right
boards<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:52.479> we<00:00:53.479> got<00:00:53.659> our<00:00:53.809> angles<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:55.159> need<00:00:55.309> our

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
boards and we got our angles we need our

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.490 
boards and we got our angles we need our
lengths<00:00:56.860> for<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.040> little<00:00:58.369> piece<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.760> paper

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
lengths for this little piece of paper

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.079 
lengths for this little piece of paper
did<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.589> can't<00:01:00.799> look<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:03.699> we're<00:01:04.699> using<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
did you can't look it we're using the

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.250 
did you can't look it we're using the
metric<00:01:06.220> numbers<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:07.460> way<00:01:07.670> more<00:01:07.700> accurate

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
metric numbers it's way more accurate

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:16.660 
metric numbers it's way more accurate
library's<00:01:09.260> a<00:01:09.880> lot<00:01:10.880> more<00:01:11.119> easy<00:01:12.970> it's<00:01:13.970> easier<00:01:15.670> so

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
library's a lot more easy it's easier so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
library's a lot more easy it's easier so
our<00:01:17.509> 24<00:01:18.200> foot<00:01:18.470> dome<00:01:18.710> we're<00:01:19.070> cutting<00:01:19.400> 30a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
our 24 foot dome we're cutting 30a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.899 
our 24 foot dome we're cutting 30a
struts<00:01:21.560> at<00:01:22.090> one<00:01:23.090> point<00:01:23.390> two<00:01:23.840> seven<00:01:24.200> five<00:01:24.909> what

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
struts at one point two seven five what

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.770 
struts at one point two seven five what
we<00:01:26.030> did<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:26.390> cut<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.810> one<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.439> length<00:01:28.780> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
we did was cut this one to length and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.080 
we did was cut this one to length and
now<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.079> are<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:33.069> have<00:01:34.069> to<00:01:34.219> cut<00:01:34.399> off<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.700> ends<00:01:34.969> of

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
now we are I have to cut off the ends of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.609 
now we are I have to cut off the ends of
the<00:01:35.210> old<00:01:35.420> ones

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.620 

as<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:42.859> can<00:01:43.009> see<00:01:43.509> we<00:01:44.509> had<00:01:44.719> these<00:01:46.509> angled<00:01:49.630> just

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
as you can see we had these angled just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.819 
as you can see we had these angled just
look<00:01:50.810> at<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.350> way<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.679> could<00:01:51.920> tell<00:01:52.189> that

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
look at it that way you could tell that

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.690 
look at it that way you could tell that
this<00:01:54.829> way<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:56.360> has<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:57.280> Arrowhead<00:01:58.280> cut<00:01:58.549> on

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
this way and it has a Arrowhead cut on

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.520 
this way and it has a Arrowhead cut on
it<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.560> what<00:02:00.799> we're<00:02:01.039> doing<00:02:01.069> is<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.259> our

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:17.979 

complex<00:02:10.180> line<00:02:11.180> up<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> edge<00:02:11.690> over<00:02:11.959> here<00:02:16.989> make

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
complex line up the edge over here make

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:43.120 
complex line up the edge over here make
the<00:02:18.140> mark<00:02:38.440> now<00:02:41.200> all<00:02:42.200> those<00:02:42.500> boards<00:02:42.950> are<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
the mark now all those boards are the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.129 
the mark now all those boards are the
same<00:02:44.139> so<00:02:46.090> once<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.209> get<00:02:47.329> all<00:02:47.480> those<00:02:47.569> cut<00:02:47.870> we're

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
same so once we get all those cut we're

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.180 
same so once we get all those cut we're
going<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> put<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> angles<00:02:48.799> on<00:02:48.920> them<00:02:49.040> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
going to put the angles on them and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.269 
going to put the angles on them and
we'll<00:02:50.000> be<00:02:50.120> back
