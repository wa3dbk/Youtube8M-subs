00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 
hey how's it going this is Jeremy Smith

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.100 
hey how's it going this is Jeremy Smith
with<00:00:15.470> art<00:00:15.770> design<00:00:16.040> labs<00:00:16.540> and<00:00:17.540> today<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:17.840> thought

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
with art design labs and today I thought

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.080 
with art design labs and today I thought
I'd<00:00:18.260> go<00:00:18.410> over<00:00:18.530> a<00:00:18.650> quick<00:00:18.770> tip<00:00:19.040> on<00:00:19.190> how<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.460> import

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
I'd go over a quick tip on how to import

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.900 
I'd go over a quick tip on how to import
a<00:00:20.270> Sketchup<00:00:20.720> model<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.200> to<00:00:21.560> rev<00:00:21.740> it<00:00:21.890> into<00:00:22.820> the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
a Sketchup model and to rev it into the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.490 
a Sketchup model and to rev it into the
massing<00:00:23.240> interface<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:23.750> that<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:23.960> can<00:00:24.140> apply

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
massing interface so that you can apply

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.590 
massing interface so that you can apply
roofs<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.070> walls<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.700> can<00:00:26.240> use<00:00:26.360> it<00:00:26.480> as<00:00:26.570> a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
roofs and walls to it can use it as a

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.210 
roofs and walls to it can use it as a
reference<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:27.260> start<00:00:27.830> designing<00:00:28.100> your

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
reference to start designing your

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.750 
reference to start designing your
building

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
building

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.840 
building
um<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:29.750> let's<00:00:29.840> dig<00:00:30.260> right<00:00:30.289> in<00:00:30.620> here<00:00:30.830> let's<00:00:31.730> say

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
um so let's dig right in here let's say

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.560 
um so let's dig right in here let's say
you<00:00:31.940> have<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.150> Sketchup<00:00:32.629> model<00:00:34.239> there's<00:00:35.239> one<00:00:35.540> I

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
you have a Sketchup model there's one I

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.650 
you have a Sketchup model there's one I
did<00:00:35.900> very<00:00:36.140> quickly<00:00:36.410> much<00:00:37.190> another<00:00:37.660> really

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
did very quickly much another really

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.830 
did very quickly much another really
good<00:00:38.809> Sketchup<00:00:39.379> modeler<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:40.489> um<00:00:40.820> if<00:00:41.690> you've

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
good Sketchup modeler but um if you've

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.970 
good Sketchup modeler but um if you've
ever<00:00:42.020> asked<00:00:42.170> me<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.350> question<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.770> how<00:00:42.920> to

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
ever asked me the question of how to

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.639 
ever asked me the question of how to
import<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:43.580> into<00:00:43.670> rivet<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.530> figured<00:00:45.530> I'd

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
import it into rivet so I figured I'd

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.060 
import it into rivet so I figured I'd
learned<00:00:46.040> how<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.190> do<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:47.680> but<00:00:48.680> for<00:00:48.800> those<00:00:48.920> who

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
learned how to do it but for those who

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.740 
learned how to do it but for those who
aren't<00:00:49.280> really<00:00:49.520> comfortable<00:00:49.970> with<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.270> new

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
aren't really comfortable with the new

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.560 
aren't really comfortable with the new
app<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.200> new<00:00:51.620> massing<00:00:51.980> interface<00:00:52.370> or<00:00:53.329> they

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
app the new massing interface or they

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.170 
app the new massing interface or they
just<00:00:53.750> prefer<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:54.079> use<00:00:54.170> Sketchup<00:00:54.410> for<00:00:54.620> massing

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
just prefer to use Sketchup for massing

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.729 
just prefer to use Sketchup for massing
it<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.390> quite<00:00:56.809> quick<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:57.290> can<00:00:57.620> easily

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
it is quite quick and you can easily

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.680 
it is quite quick and you can easily
mask<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.370> want<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:58.820> Sketchup<00:00:59.210> very

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
mask what you want and Sketchup very

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.090 
mask what you want and Sketchup very
quickly<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.590> if<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:00.950> you're

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
quickly and if it's what you're

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.889 
quickly and if it's what you're
comfortable<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:01.610> that's<00:01:01.910> fine<00:01:02.090> I'd

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
comfortable with and that's fine I'd

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.260 
comfortable with and that's fine I'd
mess<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.250> then<00:01:04.489> bring<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
mess it here and then bring that in and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.969 
mess it here and then bring that in and
and<00:01:05.660> use<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.140> as<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.320> reference<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.740> your

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
and use that as a reference for your

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.260 
and use that as a reference for your
walls<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.399> your<00:01:07.460> roofs<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.850> things<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.180> that

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
walls and your roofs and things of that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.380 
walls and your roofs and things of that
nature<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.490> anyway<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.090> you've<00:01:11.210> done<00:01:11.330> your

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
nature so so anyway so you've done your

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.240 
nature so so anyway so you've done your
Sketchup<00:01:11.750> model<00:01:11.990> here's<00:01:12.289> my<00:01:12.500> generic<00:01:12.979> one<00:01:13.220> I

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
Sketchup model here's my generic one I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.190 
Sketchup model here's my generic one I
just<00:01:13.340> created<00:01:13.550> just<00:01:14.360> kind<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.539> save<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.899> file

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
just created just kind of save it file

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.530 
just created just kind of save it file
save<00:01:15.440> as<00:01:15.790> typically<00:01:16.790> I'll<00:01:16.940> save<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.330> as<00:01:17.510> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
save as typically I'll save it as a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.240 
save as typically I'll save it as a
older<00:01:18.020> version<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.380> Sketchup

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.960 

sometimes<00:01:22.250> there's<00:01:22.460> quirked<00:01:22.670> with<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
sometimes there's quirked with the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.100 
sometimes there's quirked with the
newest<00:01:23.210> version<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.510> Sketchup<00:01:23.690> when<00:01:23.990> you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
newest version of Sketchup when you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.170 
newest version of Sketchup when you
import<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:24.680> does<00:01:25.490> really<00:01:25.670> matter<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.970> can

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
import it but does really matter you can

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.310 
import it but does really matter you can
choose<00:01:26.330> any<00:01:26.479> one<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:26.690> want<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.960> I'm<00:01:27.200> just

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
going to save it as Sketchup five and

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.770 
going to save it as Sketchup five and
clinic<00:01:29.240> College<00:01:29.590> building<00:01:31.540> building<00:01:32.540> starts

so<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.380> just<00:01:45.530> started<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.830> new<00:01:45.860> project<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.060> now

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
so I just started a new project and now

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.090 
so I just started a new project and now
the<00:01:47.930> important<00:01:48.350> thing<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.500> remember<00:01:48.710> when

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the important thing to remember when

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770 
the important thing to remember when
importing<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.640> Sketchup<00:01:50.000> model<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.600> can't

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
importing a Sketchup model is you can't

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.890 
importing a Sketchup model is you can't
just<00:01:51.080> simply<00:01:51.290> go<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:51.979> insert<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:53.600> know<00:01:53.689> clean

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
just simply go to insert you know clean

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.569 
just simply go to insert you know clean
cut<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.200> bring<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.680> in<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.009> actually<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.400> to

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
cut and bring it in you actually have to

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.609 
cut and bring it in you actually have to
start<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.960> actually<00:01:57.079> have<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.380> start<00:01:57.590> a

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
start it you actually have to start a

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.679 
start it you actually have to start a
master's<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.759> yeah<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.360> want<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.570> go<00:01:59.630> to

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
master's so yeah so you want to go to

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.170 
master's so yeah so you want to go to
your<00:01:59.810> mask<00:02:00.020> inside<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.680> place<00:02:01.100> mats<00:02:01.369> make

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
your mask inside and place mats make

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.760 
your mask inside and place mats make
sure<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.630> first<00:02:02.869> before<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.320> import

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
sure you do this first before you import

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.929 
sure you do this first before you import
the<00:02:03.860> mass<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.340> won't<00:02:04.520> actually<00:02:04.640> be<00:02:04.820> able

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
the mass but you won't actually be able

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.030 
the mass but you won't actually be able
to<00:02:05.060> edit<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.420> many<00:02:06.229> times<00:02:06.470> people<00:02:06.770> will<00:02:06.860> just

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
to edit it many times people will just

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.219 
to edit it many times people will just
import<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> mass<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:08.810> try<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:08.989> start

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
import the mass and then try to start

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.449 
import the mass and then try to start
applying<00:02:09.410> walls<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.920> things<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.369> nature

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
applying walls and things of that nature

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.280 
applying walls and things of that nature
to<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.209> won't<00:02:11.269> work<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.780> have<00:02:12.200> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
to it but it won't work you have to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.650 
to it but it won't work you have to
first<00:02:12.530> go<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.400> masse<00:02:13.640> insight<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.209> place<00:02:14.420> mats

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
first go to masse insight in place mats

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.259 
first go to masse insight in place mats
or<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:15.680> you're<00:02:15.799> using<00:02:15.980> 2008<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.180> go

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
or if you're using 2008 you want to go

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.490 
or if you're using 2008 you want to go
to<00:02:17.329> your<00:02:17.630> modified<00:02:18.620> create<00:02:19.280> mask<00:02:19.519> first<00:02:20.500> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
to your modified create mask first and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.240 
to your modified create mask first and
then<00:02:21.910> maybe<00:02:22.910> what<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.239> want<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.630> now

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.210 
mass automatically turned on you want to
do<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.120> place<00:02:36.300> mask<00:02:36.710> mass<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.070> what

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
do it in place mask mass and then what

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.400 
do it in place mask mass and then what
you<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:41.420> building<00:02:42.420> okay

same thing so I was gonna go to link say

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.470 
same thing so I was gonna go to link say
linked<00:02:54.900> head<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.430> CAD<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.030> only<00:02:57.180> CAD

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
linked head and then CAD is not only CAD

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.820 
linked head and then CAD is not only CAD
documents<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.080> actually<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> gives<00:02:58.620> you

other options here as well such as dot s
80,000<00:03:02.070> Sketchup<00:03:02.430> files<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.090> I'm<00:03:03.150> gonna<00:03:03.300> go<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
80,000 Sketchup files so I'm gonna go to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.630 
80,000 Sketchup files so I'm gonna go to
schedule<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.770> we're<00:03:04.860> gonna<00:03:04.980> find<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> file

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
schedule then we're gonna find the file

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.180 
schedule then we're gonna find the file
we<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:05.850> saved<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.800> think<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.860> called<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
we just saved I think I called it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.410 
we just saved I think I called it
building<00:03:08.489> yeah<00:03:08.820> there<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
building yeah there it is

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.440 
building yeah there it is
I'm<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.110> gonna<00:03:10.230> say<00:03:10.410> open<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:12.180> gonna<00:03:12.270> bring

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
I'm just gonna say open it's gonna bring

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.600 
I'm just gonna say open it's gonna bring
that<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.810> there<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.560> then<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.520> move

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
that in there it is then we can move

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.470 
that in there it is then we can move
that<00:03:14.730> into<00:03:15.030> place<00:03:15.270> here<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.020> if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.070> want<00:03:17.130> to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
that into place here or if you want to

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.699 
that into place here or if you want to
now<00:03:18.480> once<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:18.750> done<00:03:18.840> importing<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
now once you're done importing it you

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.979 
now once you're done importing it you
can<00:03:19.830> say<00:03:19.980> finish<00:03:20.220> mass<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.330> now<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.510> object

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
can say finish mass so now that object

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.680 
can say finish mass so now that object
became<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.410> mass<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.270> generic

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
became a mass and not just a generic

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.199 
became a mass and not just a generic
object<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.519> mall<00:03:29.700> election<00:03:30.000> comes

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
object and in the mall election comes

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.370 
object and in the mall election comes
actual<00:03:30.540> mass<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.140> actually

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
actual mass that you can actually

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.259 
actual mass that you can actually
manipulate<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.430> manipulated<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.150> can

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
manipulate when I manipulated you can

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.910 
manipulate when I manipulated you can
actually<00:03:33.360> apply<00:03:33.930> walls<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.560> roofs<00:03:34.739> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
actually apply walls and roofs and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.039 
actually apply walls and roofs and
things<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.190> nature<00:03:35.250> too<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.780> once<00:03:36.959> we

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
things of that nature too so once we

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.240 
things of that nature too so once we
have<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.380> there<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.769> actually<00:03:38.160> have

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
have that in there now we actually have

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.530 
have that in there now we actually have

you<00:03:47.459> want<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.510> can<00:03:48.540> say<00:03:49.730> these<00:03:50.730> walls

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you want and you can say these walls

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.810 
you want and you can say these walls
need<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.330> roofs<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:52.920> cadence<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.370> crepe<00:03:53.610> roof

and create that roof for you and you can

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.850 
and create that roof for you and you can
go<00:03:56.070> into<00:03:56.810> masks<00:03:57.810> inside<00:03:58.019> followed<00:03:58.470> by<00:03:58.680> phase

the<00:04:10.760> create<00:04:11.000> system<00:04:11.360> now<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.780> have<00:04:11.959> those<00:04:12.170> and

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
the create system now you have those and

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.470 
the create system now you have those and
now<00:04:13.340> all<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.579> have<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.849> is<00:04:13.970> turn<00:04:14.180> off<00:04:14.329> that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
now all you have to do is turn off that

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.620 
now all you have to do is turn off that
mass<00:04:14.689> and<00:04:14.720> you'll<00:04:14.989> see<00:04:15.170> your<00:04:15.319> walls<00:04:16.509> that<00:04:17.509> were

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
mass and you'll see your walls that were

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.349 
mass and you'll see your walls that were
created<00:04:17.959> off<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.350> mass<00:04:19.090> now<00:04:20.090> because

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
created off of that mass now because

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.699 
created off of that mass now because
it's<00:04:20.539> linked<00:04:20.900> we<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.139> actually<00:04:21.259> go<00:04:21.500> back<00:04:21.680> to

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
it's linked we can actually go back to

it's linked we can actually go back to
our<00:04:21.889> Sketchup<00:04:22.250> file<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> let's<00:04:24.259> say<00:04:24.410> we<00:04:24.530> raise

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
our Sketchup file and let's say we raise

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:33.010 
our Sketchup file and let's say we raise
this<00:04:24.919> up<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.160> bit<00:04:25.340> bring<00:04:25.789> this<00:04:25.910> out<00:04:26.090> some<00:04:32.020> try

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
this up a bit bring this out some try

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.060 
this up a bit bring this out some try
cuts<00:04:33.199> out<00:04:33.289> some<00:04:33.440> more<00:04:33.590> make<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.770> little<00:04:33.949> bit

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
you know reload a new one we just said

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.770 
you know reload a new one we just said
the<00:04:58.490> new<00:04:58.610> one<00:04:58.760> we<00:04:58.850> just<00:04:59.030> edited<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.479> now<00:04:59.600> it's<00:04:59.750> a

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
the new one we just edited so now it's a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.950 
the new one we just edited so now it's a
lot<00:04:59.900> wider<00:05:00.229> here<00:05:00.680> as<00:05:01.340> we<00:05:01.550> pushed<00:05:01.789> back<00:05:01.960> has

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
lot wider here as we pushed back has

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.770 
lot wider here as we pushed back has
been<00:05:03.080> pushed<00:05:03.349> up<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.610> if<00:05:05.539> you<00:05:05.630> haven't

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
been pushed up and if you haven't

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.270 
been pushed up and if you haven't
changed<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.169> geometry<00:05:06.320> too<00:05:06.740> much<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.130> can

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
changed the geometry too much you can

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.700 
changed the geometry too much you can
often<00:05:07.849> simply<00:05:08.630> choose<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.960> faces<00:05:09.560> you've

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
often simply choose the faces you've

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.680 
often simply choose the faces you've
already<00:05:09.889> created<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.639> say<00:05:10.820> update<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.360> face

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.520 

this<00:05:14.690> one<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:14.930> not<00:05:15.050> gonna<00:05:15.139> work<00:05:15.320> exactly

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
this one is not gonna work exactly

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.790 
this one is not gonna work exactly
because<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.729> was<00:05:16.820> pushed<00:05:17.030> out<00:05:17.150> too<00:05:17.360> much<00:05:17.800> many

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
because it was pushed out too much many

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560 
because it was pushed out too much many
times<00:05:19.070> with<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> sketchup<00:05:19.970> link<00:05:20.240> it's<00:05:20.419> not

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
times with a sketchup link it's not

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.050 
times with a sketchup link it's not
gonna<00:05:20.720> be<00:05:21.139> able<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.440> update<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.130> faces<00:05:22.460> as<00:05:22.669> as

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
gonna be able to update the faces as as

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.670 
gonna be able to update the faces as as
readily<00:05:23.720> as<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.050> limb<00:05:24.199> be<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:24.560> actually

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
readily as the limb be if you actually

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.980 
readily as the limb be if you actually
created<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.190> mass<00:05:25.370> in<00:05:25.580> Revit<00:05:25.909> so<00:05:26.720> there<00:05:26.900> are

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
created the mass in Revit so there are

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.360 
created the mass in Revit so there are
some<00:05:27.110> disadvantages<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.830> using<00:05:27.919> Sketchup

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
some disadvantages to using Sketchup

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.850 
some disadvantages to using Sketchup
mass<00:05:28.699> versus<00:05:29.120> one<00:05:29.419> created<00:05:29.780> in<00:05:29.870> Revit<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.440> was

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
mass versus one created in Revit I was

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.070 
mass versus one created in Revit I was
suggest<00:05:31.159> creating<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.330> mass<00:05:32.479> in<00:05:32.659> Revit<00:05:32.990> if

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
suggest creating the mass in Revit if

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.620 
suggest creating the mass in Revit if
you<00:05:33.169> can<00:05:33.460> but<00:05:34.460> if<00:05:34.580> you've<00:05:35.210> already<00:05:35.389> created

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
you can but if you've already created

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.899 
you can but if you've already created
some<00:05:35.840> complex<00:05:36.289> shape<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.280> sketchup<00:05:37.789> you

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
some complex shape and sketchup you

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.659 
some complex shape and sketchup you
wanted<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.240> use<00:05:38.360> that<00:05:38.389> one<00:05:38.720> as<00:05:38.990> far<00:05:39.320> as<00:05:39.440> well

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
wanted to use that one as far as well

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.529 
wanted to use that one as far as well
but<00:05:40.669> what's<00:05:40.849> going<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.060> ask<00:05:41.180> you<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.419> is

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
but what's going to ask you to do is

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.700 
but what's going to ask you to do is
just<00:05:41.690> gonna<00:05:41.810> have<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.050> recreate<00:05:42.349> that<00:05:42.440> whole

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
just gonna have to recreate that whole

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.719 
just gonna have to recreate that whole
system<00:05:44.139> because<00:05:45.139> it's<00:05:45.530> not<00:05:45.710> gonna<00:05:45.889> recognize

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
system because it's not gonna recognize

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.219 
system because it's not gonna recognize
it<00:05:48.820> such<00:05:49.820> as<00:05:49.940> this<00:05:50.060> roof<00:05:50.330> i<00:05:50.539> said<00:05:50.780> if<00:05:50.960> i<00:05:51.050> try<00:05:51.199> to

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
it such as this roof i said if i try to

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.260 
it such as this roof i said if i try to
update<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.620> face<00:05:51.889> it's<00:05:52.310> not<00:05:52.340> gonna<00:05:52.550> let<00:05:52.699> me<00:05:54.130> so

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
update to face it's not gonna let me so

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.520 
update to face it's not gonna let me so
so<00:05:56.270> it's<00:05:56.389> not<00:05:56.479> as<00:05:56.630> seamless<00:05:57.020> as<00:05:57.199> you<00:05:57.380> would

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
so it's not as seamless as you would

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.339 
so it's not as seamless as you would
think<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.460> sketchup<00:05:58.849> one<00:05:59.060> is<00:05:59.330> not<00:05:59.570> so<00:06:00.020> I<00:06:00.050> would

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
think the sketchup one is not so I would

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.120 
think the sketchup one is not so I would
still<00:06:00.590> say<00:06:00.770> modeling<00:06:01.310> in<00:06:02.800> Revit<00:06:03.800> as<00:06:03.889> much<00:06:04.010> as

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
still say modeling in Revit as much as

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.830 
still say modeling in Revit as much as
you<00:06:04.220> can

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
you can

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.909 
you can
versus<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> sketchup<00:06:06.289> but<00:06:06.500> if<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:06.889> a

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
versus a sketchup but if you have a

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.100 
versus a sketchup but if you have a
sketch<00:06:07.159> of<00:06:07.190> mom<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.550> want<00:06:07.729> to<00:06:07.849> use<00:06:08.000> you<00:06:08.389> can<00:06:08.930> do

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
sketch of mom you want to use you can do

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.719 
sketch of mom you want to use you can do
that<00:06:09.289> it's<00:06:09.979> just<00:06:10.220> you<00:06:10.340> don't<00:06:10.490> want<00:06:10.610> to<00:06:10.669> be
