00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.439
 hello people here is christian von 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.600
 christians how to place the hat 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.360
 and today we are doing a really cool 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.700
 grab crazy train and ozzy 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.270
 osbourne back then from randy rhoads 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.449
 played that probably because the most played 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.860
 Reef ever in all music life 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.680
 youtube or something and I'll show you now 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.650
 Just how we do it we go 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.530
 directly purely so here we are now in 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.409
 second bunch and we have to do the whole thing 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.589
 So bary grab the first note game 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.159
 with the second miracle for page and 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.040
 then you play the two again 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:06.130
 very heavy the 44 pages 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 then the two will be on top of the de 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.860
 five on the aa then neither the 2 and the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.729
 40 the 2 you see is always 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.760
 alternate 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.189
 the difficulty here is that we have the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.630
 people always different so that 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 have to play alternately and not 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 rather 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.909
 I and I play that too 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.100
 upper notes are damped and so 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.700
 the side refused and the a side then 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.700
 not damped 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 are you so up in the index finger 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.920
 the second bunch and then you go 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.539
 ring finger on the four then again the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.609
 forefinger you take him directly the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.429
 finger up a little bit 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.740
 then the little finger on the 5 of the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.399
 index finger can go back up 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.399
 to see that so well 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.979
 that was too much i need to be next to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 the forefinger not great of that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:36.680
 fingerboard from the side then off that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.370
 is the first part then comes the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 second 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.829
 you swim in the back on the a side of the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.169
 to the 2 with the little finger the five 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.700
 on the side then the 44 um with the 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.190
 So with the ring finger and with the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.130
 little fingers again the 5 peter 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.130
 hassmann already good dexterity 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.750
 then again the 2 dani 54 and then as 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.750
 last the zero 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:33.010
 no finger ring finger four small 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:43.780
 finger back five then back to 254 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:47.620
 rings and zero so times my 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.690
 right hand a bit more so now 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.090
 at the stop with right and left 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.300
 is now so I play now too 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.300
 do 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:13.990
 I play everything as a tee and first 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:15.580
 then the slightly faster notes 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.340
 they are not all are eighth 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.780
 but then the notes here with the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.870
 ring finger with the small fingers 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.340
 I play the games then as 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.340
 surcharge therefore tee 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:35.530
 now comes the 2a with the plectrum 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.520
 I now below the a side then 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.080
 I make a change on the 56 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.509
 hit the 4 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.720
 Next hit the movies soon 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:50.759
 I'm over half above the e string now 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:56.319
 I go back to the a side from the top 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:58.660
 from the bottom to the five change blow 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.810
 on the 4th 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.810
 and 9 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.849
 you then have the zero plays from the bottom 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.930
 up but that's not 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.590
 You can also do worse if you are 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.680
 one then from 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.910
 then the four interwoven beats 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.890
 then climb from the top again 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.550
 You have to be good with the way too 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.580
 hit with the alternate african gold in 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.320
 Beijing , you have to stop that one 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.080
 bit the routine 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.490
 oh yes, otherwise that would be it 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.840
 actually the whole team is just 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:55.790
 try to dampen the side up 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:55.790
 and then the a side there are so many 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.270
 So played in fast as you can hear 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.350
 very nice not covered out 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.060
 deflected dampened not dampened so 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.979

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.660
