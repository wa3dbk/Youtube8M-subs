 better explained how to install ampayer 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.129
 heart point did well let's start but 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.409
 before I present my new assistant 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.260
 Naomi station she will explain the 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.120
 rest of the installation thank you very much what 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.940
 first thing to do is go to the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.399
 links that I left in the description of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.799
 we unloaded the ampayer heath followed by the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.380
 the moon tools notice I do not release them 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.190
 because I already have them I will only teach them 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.190
 to install them 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.890
 the second thing they should do is once 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.850
 downloaded the ampayer heart file 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 they must extract it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 once they have removed it they should 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 open the leyma a tools and select the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 option that says add virtual unit dt 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 then they must click on the option that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.150
 says add image that is a disk with 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.150
 a sign of + 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.670
 now they should look where they downloaded 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.039
 the ampayer heart file and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.450

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.130
 we select the option to mount this 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.850
 will make it run as if it were a 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.850
 normal disk 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
