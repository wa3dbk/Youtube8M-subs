you'll notice that these files here are

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.550 
you'll notice that these files here are
still<00:01:58.640> named<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> safety<00:02:00.600> car<00:02:00.869> prefixes

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
of sc2 now the game will be able to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.169 
of sc2 now the game will be able to
locate<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.899> MC<00:02:07.439> 2<00:02:07.799> folder<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:09.090> will

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
locate this MC 2 folder and then it will

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.860 
locate this MC 2 folder and then it will
try<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.979> load<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.340> end<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:12.239> McLaren<00:02:12.660> files

they're<00:02:15.420> labeled<00:02:15.810> something<00:02:16.140> else<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.500> so

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
they're labeled something else here so

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.060 
they're labeled something else here so
we<00:02:17.430> need<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.730> read<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.180> riya<00:02:18.780> rename<00:02:19.560> them<00:02:19.769> to
