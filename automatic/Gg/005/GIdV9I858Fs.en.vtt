00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.799
 Y 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.419
 hello youtube guys and girls today 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.800
 I am one more day with giving them more 99 hours 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.640
 making a video in which we will show 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.590
 today how are all the costumes achieved 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.450
 I'm missing two but I know how 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.450
 get them so it will not be an impediment 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.920
 if I have eight of the ten are my costumes 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.339
 anyone is impossible 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.989
 they are very difficult good one is not 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.989
 difficult what happens is that you take a lot 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.450
 we enter the secret rooms 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.720
 all right 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.370
 the outfits are killer attire 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.120
 this is the normal one that you give to 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.670
 principle, they give it to you at the beginning of 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.820
 game when you get to sequence 5 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 I think it was nothing that at the end of the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.670
 game it looks like he took off his hood 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 and in the end it stays like this after here 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.930
 would go in this vacuum would the attire of 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.840
 altair that by the way stays much more 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.590
 bright with the bow and that and it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.860
 get doing 100% in all 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.080
 missions thing that is very difficult in the 3 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.259
 after the original attire of achilles 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.570
 he does it by doing all the missions 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.090
 of the hacienda 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.009
 I've just taken it off so I do not 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.100
 I'm going to put it back in uniform 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.100
 captain of l'aquila 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:21.830
 you get with others just like 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.830
 the attire this I'm looking at 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.790
 and this one did not forgive 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.650
 no no if it is acting from there if it is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.580
 get with the tlc of secrets 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.270
 hidden 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.270
 all right 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.620
 it's worth buying on playstation these 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.690
 dark secrets 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.170
 this is the captain's attire that 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.110
 get doing the missions of the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.810
 captain kirk or you change the trinkets 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.320

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.410
 side of the ship do the mission chairs and 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.810
 at the end he gets his attire 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.240

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.750

 with 30 points 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.110
 good but but they are achieved with more 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.270
 story so you have to do it from 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.910
 anyway the blue the outfit of 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.880
 this traditional colonial murderer 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.930
 it is also achieved with the same dlc as 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.760
 the one of the captain of l'aquila the dlc of the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.400
 hidden places and good is handsome to me 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.760
 the huddle s will get goose 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.549
 tip good you see that part there 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.079
 coming out of the head and it looks like a 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:56.540
 soldier more than a murderer I do not know why 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.269
 has the assassin symbol in the huddle 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.220
 I do not know if it looks good you see it too 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.750
 I'm looking a little loose now it will look 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.560
 best 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.540
 Well, if it were not because you have 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.160
 we say and those who have 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.600
 the axes there that also throw you 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.730
 mine those heavy annoying and the last 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.000
 is the prisoner attire you nothing 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.820
 in the story mode when 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.770
 They make you prisoners after 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.980
 complete that sequence when you already 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:33.370
 you release the pressure and then it says 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.490
 that you have unlocked it and well there 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.040
 would be like I said before the high and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.380
 that is achieved by completing 100% and here 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.440
 next to him 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:50.729

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:55.500
 ca'n and the one of carmen that here is obtained 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.600
 with the 100 pens that by the way if the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.080
 they want 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.780
 if they want to see them, they buy a map in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.390

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.520
