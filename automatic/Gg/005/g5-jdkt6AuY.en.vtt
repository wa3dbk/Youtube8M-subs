00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
let's do this now just as a random note

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910 
let's do this now just as a random note
this<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.760> may<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:43.079> louder<00:00:43.440> than

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this one may be a little bit louder than

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
this one may be a little bit louder than
the<00:00:44.489> last<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.750> sure<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the last one not sure I'm kind of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
the last one not sure I'm kind of
staying<00:00:46.950> away<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.460> microphone<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.270> little

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
staying away from my microphone a little

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
staying away from my microphone a little
bit<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.160> using<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.640> hapa

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bit just because I'm using the hapa

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.040 
bit just because I'm using the hapa
software<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.670> capture<00:00:53.670> card<00:00:53.699> um<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
software that's my capture card um I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
software that's my capture card um I
don't<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:56.010> full<00:00:56.280> control<00:00:56.610> over<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
don't really have full control over the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
don't really have full control over the
audio<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.600> can't<00:00:57.930> edit<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.320> audacity<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
audio I can't edit in audacity like I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.990 
audio I can't edit in audacity like I
did<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> last<00:00:59.609> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
did the last one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.869 
did the last one
so<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:01.170> pretty<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.980> own<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.430> so

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
so we're pretty much on our own here so

so we're pretty much on our own here so
um<00:01:03.270> yeah<00:01:03.780> let's<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> garage<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
um yeah let's just go to the garage and

alright let's begin our upgrading
process<00:01:09.900> um<00:01:10.560> engine<00:01:11.369> swap<00:01:11.670> let's<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.530> Veyron

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
process um engine swap let's see Veyron

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.510 
process um engine swap let's see Veyron
ss<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.520> don't

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
ss what can we really do here I don't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
ss what can we really do here I don't
know<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.970> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.780> an<00:01:18.990> engine<00:01:19.320> swap<00:01:19.560> or

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
know if I want to do an engine swap or

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.240 
know if I want to do an engine swap or
yet<00:01:19.950> um<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.630> meant<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.500> helps<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
yet um or not I meant it helps with the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
yet um or not I meant it helps with the
acceleration<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> launch<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.350> um

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
acceleration in the launch a lot but um

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
acceleration in the launch a lot but um
just<00:01:27.530> doesn't<00:01:28.530> adjust<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> speed<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just doesn't adjust the speed which is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
just doesn't adjust the speed which is
what<00:01:30.479> we're<00:01:30.659> doing<00:01:30.840> today<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.650> making

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
what we're doing today by the way making

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
what we're doing today by the way making
an<00:01:32.430> updated<00:01:33.210> version<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> fastest<00:01:34.439> car

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
an updated version of the fastest car

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.880 
an updated version of the fastest car
enforcer<00:01:35.400> horizon<00:01:35.790> 2<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.680> go

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
enforcer horizon 2 so we're gonna go

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
enforcer horizon 2 so we're gonna go
pretty<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.610> favor<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> speed<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pretty much in favor of speed here the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
pretty much in favor of speed here the
engine<00:01:40.350> swap<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.860> doesn't<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.820> let's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
engine swap just doesn't do it so let's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:42.560 
engine swap just doesn't do it so let's
do<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
do that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
do that
um<00:01:43.259> Audio<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:44.700> sync<00:01:45.060> um<00:01:45.869> not

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
um Audio will be little off sync um not

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
um Audio will be little off sync um not
in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> video<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:48.180> me<00:01:48.299> right<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:48.689> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in the video but for me right now just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.300 
in the video but for me right now just
because<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.579> haha<00:01:50.880> software<00:01:51.390> has<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> delay

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
because the haha software has to delay

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
because the haha software has to delay
so<00:01:53.310> um<00:01:53.640> basically<00:01:54.259> what<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.409> hearing<00:01:55.829> right

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so um basically what I'm hearing right

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740 
so um basically what I'm hearing right
now<00:01:56.040> aside<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.570> doing

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
now aside from what I'm actually doing

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.560 
now aside from what I'm actually doing
on<00:01:58.049> my<00:01:58.170> TV<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> tad<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.420> bit

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on my TV is just that tad little bit

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
on my TV is just that tad little bit
delayed<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.189> audio<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.729> makes<00:02:02.880> no<00:02:02.969> sense

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
delayed so the audio just makes no sense

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.719 
delayed so the audio just makes no sense
to<00:02:03.390> me<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.500> does<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.159> guys<00:02:05.369> because

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to me but it does to you guys because

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999 
to me but it does to you guys because
it's<00:02:05.939> perfectly<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.659> sync<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.950> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it's perfectly on sync there so here we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's perfectly on sync there so here we
go<00:02:08.129> we're<00:02:08.310> keeping<00:02:08.610> our<00:02:08.729> speed<00:02:09.060> we've<00:02:09.270> pretty

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
go we're keeping our speed we've pretty

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.510 
go we're keeping our speed we've pretty
much<00:02:09.569> gotten<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> launch<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.340> where

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
much gotten the launch right up to where

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.020 
much gotten the launch right up to where
it<00:02:11.640> was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
it was

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.990 
it was
there<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.600> go<00:02:13.780> let's<00:02:14.020> seize<00:02:14.440> do<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.760> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
there we go let's seize do that and this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.900 
there we go let's seize do that and this
we<00:02:16.990> don't<00:02:17.140> seem<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.560> be<00:02:17.710> getting<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.460> speed

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
we don't seem to be getting the speed

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.110 
we don't seem to be getting the speed
anywhere<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:20.140> after<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.460> want<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> like

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
anywhere like after this I want to like

anywhere like after this I want to like
sort<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.810> cut<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.440> see<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:25.390> doing<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.080> engine

swap<00:02:26.710> actually<00:02:27.130> helps<00:02:27.400> us<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.820> speed<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.540> be

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
swap actually helps us with speed so be

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.520 
swap actually helps us with speed so be
right<00:02:29.260> back<00:02:29.500> oh<00:02:29.740> wow<00:02:30.540> yeah<00:02:31.540> something<00:02:32.350> tells

and I think all of the parts I just
installed<00:02:38.800> yeah<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.520> not<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.060> anymore

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
some things in this game because it this

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.779 
some things in this game because it this
is<00:06:11.839> a<00:06:11.870> 360<00:06:12.589> version<00:06:12.889> it<00:06:12.979> just<00:06:13.069> doesn't<00:06:13.610> have<00:06:13.759> it

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
is a 360 version it just doesn't have it

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.269 
is a 360 version it just doesn't have it
that<00:06:14.569> includes<00:06:14.900> stuff<00:06:15.199> like<00:06:15.409> sort<00:06:15.740> of<00:06:15.830> stance

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
that includes stuff like sort of stance

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.939 
that includes stuff like sort of stance
tilts<00:06:17.000> because<00:06:17.449> Stan<00:06:17.839> Singh<00:06:18.139> really<00:06:18.589> requires

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
tilts because Stan Singh really requires

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.610 
tilts because Stan Singh really requires
a<00:06:19.099> lot<00:06:19.189> of<00:06:19.460> tuning<00:06:19.879> to<00:06:20.539> get<00:06:20.689> the<00:06:20.779> tires<00:06:21.050> correct

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
a lot of tuning to get the tires correct

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.129 
a lot of tuning to get the tires correct
and<00:06:21.919> the<00:06:22.310> handling<00:06:22.729> correct<00:06:23.060> that's<00:06:23.870> not

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
and the handling correct that's not

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.869 
and the handling correct that's not
going<00:06:24.259> to<00:06:24.349> happen<00:06:24.680> but<00:06:25.279> like<00:06:25.550> stuff<00:06:25.819> like

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879 
going to happen but like stuff like

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.809 
going to happen but like stuff like
drift<00:06:26.360> builds<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.139> source<00:06:28.129> stuff<00:06:28.400> like<00:06:28.580> that

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
drift builds and source stuff like that

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.529 
drift builds and source stuff like that
I<00:06:29.000> can<00:06:29.270> still<00:06:29.689> do<00:06:30.310> um<00:06:31.310> as<00:06:31.520> well<00:06:32.029> as<00:06:32.089> speed

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
I can still do um as well as speed

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.540 
I can still do um as well as speed
builds<00:06:32.899> even<00:06:33.259> if<00:06:33.529> they<00:06:33.770> aren't<00:06:33.979> the<00:06:34.130> fastest

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
builds even if they aren't the fastest

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.770 
builds even if they aren't the fastest
car<00:06:34.789> I<00:06:34.819> still

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
car I still

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.650 
car I still
to<00:06:36.230> do<00:06:36.350> speed<00:06:36.740> builds<00:06:37.100> cuz<00:06:37.340> I'm<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.610> speed<00:06:38.180> freak

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
to do speed builds cuz I'm a speed freak

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.260 
to do speed builds cuz I'm a speed freak
B<00:06:39.650> I<00:06:39.740> just<00:06:39.920> recommend<00:06:40.310> what<00:06:40.700> sort<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.060> builds

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
B I just recommend what sort of builds

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.080 
B I just recommend what sort of builds
you<00:06:41.360> want<00:06:41.540> like<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:42.080> guess<00:06:42.680> I<00:06:42.920> can<00:06:43.160> do<00:06:43.310> stance<00:06:43.670> so

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
you want like I guess I can do stance so

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.870 
you want like I guess I can do stance so
it<00:06:44.389> isn't<00:06:44.720> quite<00:06:44.780> stance

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
it isn't quite stance

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.020 
it isn't quite stance
e-enough<00:06:47.139> but<00:06:48.139> yeah<00:06:48.380> I<00:06:48.410> can<00:06:48.830> do<00:06:49.160> drift<00:06:49.610> builds

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
e-enough but yeah I can do drift builds

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.090 
e-enough but yeah I can do drift builds
I<00:06:50.120> can<00:06:50.240> do<00:06:50.360> race<00:06:50.750> builds<00:06:51.350> I<00:06:51.470> can<00:06:51.620> do<00:06:51.740> like

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
I can do race builds I can do like

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.150 
I can do race builds I can do like
acceleration<00:06:52.910> builds<00:06:53.389> that<00:06:53.630> don't

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
acceleration builds that don't

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.400 
acceleration builds that don't
particularly<00:06:55.160> have<00:06:55.430> good<00:06:55.970> speed<00:06:56.360> but<00:06:56.419> amazing

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
particularly have good speed but amazing

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.530 
particularly have good speed but amazing
