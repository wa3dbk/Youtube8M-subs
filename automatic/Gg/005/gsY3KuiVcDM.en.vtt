something<00:00:23.369> slightly<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.390> my

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
something slightly different you know my

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
something slightly different you know my
gcse's<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.230> coming<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.550> thought<00:00:26.730> I'd

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
gcse's are coming up and I thought I'd

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
gcse's are coming up and I thought I'd
do<00:00:27.000> wager<00:00:27.240> matches<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> bit<00:00:28.560> purely

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
do wager matches for a bit purely

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.500 
do wager matches for a bit purely
because<00:00:29.070> they're<00:00:29.279> easier<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> make<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> then

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
because they're easier to make and then

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
because they're easier to make and then
it<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:30.869> consuming<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.470> trading<00:00:31.769> and
