00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
blog so all of that's been really good

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.720 
blog so all of that's been really good
after<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.710> first<00:00:42.920> week<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.310> didn't<00:00:43.550> really

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
after the first week I didn't really

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.190 
after the first week I didn't really
experience<00:00:44.060> any<00:00:44.390> more<00:00:44.570> weight<00:00:44.750> loss<00:00:44.930> which

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
experience any more weight loss which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.720 
experience any more weight loss which
aside<00:00:45.530> because<00:00:45.710> I<00:00:45.920> wasn't<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.310> it<00:00:46.400> for<00:00:46.430> that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
aside because I wasn't in it for that

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.020 
aside because I wasn't in it for that
and<00:00:47.290> but<00:00:48.290> one<00:00:48.410> cool<00:00:48.680> thing<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:49.100> as<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
and but one cool thing is that as the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.370 
and but one cool thing is that as the
week's<00:00:50.210> progressed<00:00:50.660> even<00:00:50.840> though<00:00:51.050> my<00:00:51.170> weight

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
week's progressed even though my weight

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.920 
week's progressed even though my weight
wasn't<00:00:51.710> really<00:00:51.890> changing<00:00:52.370> my<00:00:52.550> waist<00:00:52.880> size<00:00:53.390> was

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
wasn't really changing my waist size was

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.440 
wasn't really changing my waist size was
still<00:00:54.140> going<00:00:54.380> down<00:00:54.560> so<00:00:54.980> I'm<00:00:55.520> three<00:00:56.030> weeks<00:00:56.240> in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
still going down so I'm three weeks in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.710 
still going down so I'm three weeks in
and<00:00:56.840> my<00:00:57.200> waist<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.710> down<00:00:57.950> over<00:00:58.370> two<00:00:59.270> inches

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
and my waist is down over two inches

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.870 
and my waist is down over two inches
probably<00:00:59.990> like<00:01:00.380> two<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.800> quarter<00:01:01.010> so

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
probably like two and a quarter so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760 
probably like two and a quarter so
that's<00:01:02.210> really<00:01:02.390> cool<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.050> feels<00:01:03.260> nice<00:01:03.470> I

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
that's really cool and that feels nice I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.200 
that's really cool and that feels nice I
think<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:04.189> probably<00:01:04.460> indicative<00:01:04.790> of

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
think it's probably indicative of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.880 
think it's probably indicative of
feeling<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.750> little<00:01:05.869> less<00:01:06.170> bloated<00:01:06.439> from

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
feeling a little less bloated from

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.830 
feeling a little less bloated from
eating<00:01:07.159> all<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.579> carbs<00:01:08.179> and<00:01:08.329> wheat<00:01:08.539> and<00:01:08.749> stuff

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
eating all the carbs and wheat and stuff

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.289 
eating all the carbs and wheat and stuff
like<00:01:09.109> that<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:10.429> one<00:01:10.579> thing<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.819> will<00:01:10.999> say<00:01:11.030> is

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
like that the one thing I will say is

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.630 
like that the one thing I will say is
that<00:01:11.469> for<00:01:12.469> whatever<00:01:12.619> reason<00:01:12.829> my<00:01:13.249> stomach's

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that for whatever reason my stomach's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.059 
that for whatever reason my stomach's
not<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> hundred<00:01:14.119> percent<00:01:14.240> still<00:01:14.929> so<00:01:15.679> I'm<00:01:15.920> not

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
not a hundred percent still so I'm not

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.410 
not a hundred percent still so I'm not
sure<00:01:16.249> if<00:01:16.340> there's<00:01:16.520> another<00:01:16.729> issue<00:01:16.999> there

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
sure if there's another issue there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.499 
sure if there's another issue there
maybe<00:01:17.689> I'm<00:01:17.990> also<00:01:18.520> lactose<00:01:19.520> sensitive<00:01:20.270> or

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
maybe I'm also lactose sensitive or

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.050 
maybe I'm also lactose sensitive or
something<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:21.079> nature<00:01:21.229> or<00:01:21.859> but<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.789> did

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
something of that nature or but I did

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.179 
something of that nature or but I did
start<00:01:23.210> myself<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.749> a<00:01:23.780> probiotic<00:01:24.139> regimen<00:01:24.920> um

great that maybe you should start on

that and we'll see where that goes

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.239 
that and we'll see where that goes
it'd<00:01:38.450> be<00:01:38.569> really<00:01:38.749> nice<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.679> helped<00:01:40.159> the
