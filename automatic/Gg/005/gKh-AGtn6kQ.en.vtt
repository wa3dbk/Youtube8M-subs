about a quarter of an inch or less each

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.869 
about a quarter of an inch or less each
and<00:00:56.899> once<00:00:57.899> I've<00:00:58.109> cut<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.280> slices

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and once I've cut them into these slices

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.080 
and once I've cut them into these slices
I'm<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> turn<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> 90<00:01:01.050> degrees<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> then

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I'm going to turn it 90 degrees and then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
I'm going to turn it 90 degrees and then
I'm<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> cut<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> again<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> same<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
I'm going to cut it again the same way a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.530 
I'm going to cut it again the same way a
quarter<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.409> inch<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.650> less<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.510> as<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
quarter of an inch or less and as a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.990 
quarter of an inch or less and as a
result<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.400> getting<00:01:11.790> nice

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
result of that we are getting nice

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.980 
result of that we are getting nice
flexible<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:16.820> pieces<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.030> tofu<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.840> are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
flexible little pieces of tofu that are

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.100 
flexible little pieces of tofu that are
very<00:01:19.409> similar<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.610> too-short<00:01:21.570> noodle<00:01:21.900> pasta

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
very similar to a too-short noodle pasta

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
very similar to a too-short noodle pasta
and<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> set<00:01:23.939> those<00:01:24.060> aside

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and so we're going to set those aside

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
and so we're going to set those aside
once<00:01:24.600> we've<00:01:24.750> cut<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
once we've cut it up because we have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.429 
once we've cut it up because we have
another<00:01:26.280> step<00:01:26.610> we're<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.290> before<00:01:28.290> we

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
another step we're going to do before we

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.700 
another step we're going to do before we
combine<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.930> what<00:01:30.930> we're<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
combine it what we're going to do is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490 
combine it what we're going to do is
take<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> third<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> cup<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.110> tomato

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
take about a third of a cup of tomato

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.390 
take about a third of a cup of tomato
sauce<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.329> happen<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.750> pizza<00:01:37.439> sauce<00:01:37.650> but

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and that represents about six grams of

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
and that represents about six grams of
carb<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> highest<00:01:45.329> carb<00:01:45.720> thing

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.639 
ups the carb count typically and we're
going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> blend<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.320> tomato

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
going to blend it in with the tomato

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
going to blend it in with the tomato
sauce<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.850> some<00:02:06.119> people<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:06.659> ziti

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
sauce now the way some people make ziti

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.580 
sauce now the way some people make ziti
they<00:02:07.229> put<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.879> they<00:02:08.879> put<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> ricotta<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.229> top

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
they put the they put the ricotta on top

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.710 
they put the they put the ricotta on top
if<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.069> even<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.430> ricotta<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.510> fine

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
if they even use ricotta and that's fine

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.980 
if they even use ricotta and that's fine
if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.959> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
if you want to do that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.990 
if you want to do that
that's<00:02:14.260> oftentimes<00:02:15.070> how<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> might<00:02:15.670> make<00:02:15.850> it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
that's oftentimes how I might make it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.950 
that's oftentimes how I might make it
but<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> friend<00:02:16.360> mine<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.630> telling<00:02:16.840> me<00:02:16.930> that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
but a friend mine was telling me that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.510 
but a friend mine was telling me that
she<00:02:17.110> likes<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.560> mix<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.950> into<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.310> tomato

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
she likes to mix it into the tomato

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.400 
she likes to mix it into the tomato
sauce<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.210> that's<00:02:19.360> what<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:19.630> doing<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
sauce and so that's what I'm doing the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500 
sauce and so that's what I'm doing the
reason<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.860> mixing<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.430> now<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
reason I mixing it in now is because the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.610 
reason I mixing it in now is because the
ricotta<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.140> firm<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.750> whatever<00:02:25.750> sauce<00:02:26.200> we

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
ricotta is firm and whatever sauce we

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.600 
ricotta is firm and whatever sauce we
mix<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.080> low<00:02:29.080> carb<00:02:29.350> noodle<00:02:30.070> equivalence

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
mix with the low carb noodle equivalence

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.540 
mix with the low carb noodle equivalence
needs<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.860> needs<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:33.160> something<00:02:33.400> that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
needs to be needs to be something that

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.460 
needs to be needs to be something that
you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.880> fold<00:02:34.210> easily<00:02:34.480> if<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.320> use

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you can fold easily if you have to use

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310 
you can fold easily if you have to use
muscle<00:02:35.920> power<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.480> over<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.990> noodles

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
muscle power to get it over the noodles

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.630 
muscle power to get it over the noodles
and<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.740> among<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> noodles<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.520> you're

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and in and among the noodles then you're

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.120 
and in and among the noodles then you're
going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> damage<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.360> noodles<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:41.980> don't

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
going to damage the noodles so we don't

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770 
going to damage the noodles so we don't
want<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.090> least<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.330> don't<00:02:43.540> want<00:02:43.720> that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
want that or at least I don't want that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.620 
want that or at least I don't want that
and<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.220> want<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.640> make<00:02:45.790> sure<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.330> have

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
and so I want to make sure that I have

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.590 
and so I want to make sure that I have
the<00:02:46.660> ricotta<00:02:47.230> blended<00:02:47.710> in<00:02:47.830> first<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.030> now<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the ricotta blended in first so now that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.470 
the ricotta blended in first so now that
we've<00:02:49.720> got<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.020> blended<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.120> take<00:02:52.270> our

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
we've got it blended we can take our

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.420 
we've got it blended we can take our
noodles<00:02:53.730> put<00:02:54.730> them<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.570> then<00:02:56.400> we're<00:02:57.400> just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
noodles put them in and then we're just

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.180 
noodles put them in and then we're just
going<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.850> gently<00:02:58.270> fold<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.380> because<00:03:00.040> we

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
going to gently fold this because we

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.930 
going to gently fold this because we
don't<00:03:00.490> want<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.850> destroy<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.420> noodles<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.760> I'm

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
don't want to destroy the noodles so I'm

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.580 
don't want to destroy the noodles so I'm
going<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.120> fold<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.570> around<00:03:07.990> I<00:03:10.380> think<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.470> may

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
going to fold this around I think I may

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.380 
going to fold this around I think I may
have<00:03:11.620> used<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.980> little<00:03:12.010> much<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.790> sauce<00:03:13.030> I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
have used a little much of the sauce I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.110 
have used a little much of the sauce I
mean<00:03:13.840> not<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.920> terms<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.220> car<00:03:15.430> purposes<00:03:15.940> but

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
mean not in terms of car purposes but

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.360 
mean not in terms of car purposes but
just<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.480> terms<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.870> sauce<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.740> noodle<00:03:18.010> ratio

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
just in terms of sauce to noodle ratio

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.010 
just in terms of sauce to noodle ratio
but<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.850> can<00:03:19.000> adjust<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.420> however<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.840> like

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
but you can adjust that however you like

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.230 
but you can adjust that however you like
it<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.220> then<00:03:21.340> I'm<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.640> kind<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.910> smooth

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
it so then I'm going to kind of smooth

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.300 
it so then I'm going to kind of smooth
it<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> little<00:03:22.540> bit<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:25.560> now<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.130> add

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
it a little bit and now I'm going to add

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.930 
it a little bit and now I'm going to add
some<00:03:29.250> mild<00:03:30.250> cheese<00:03:30.550> shreds<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:36.460> I'm<00:03:36.760> just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
some mild cheese shreds and I'm just

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.790 
some mild cheese shreds and I'm just
going<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.120> sprinkle<00:03:37.360> those<00:03:37.690> over<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.140> top

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.000 

these<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:42.970> about<00:03:43.270> half<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.840> gram<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.080> carb<00:03:44.500> for

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
these have about half a gram of carb for

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.060 
these have about half a gram of carb for
a<00:03:45.250> for<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> quarter<00:03:46.390> cup<00:03:46.570> which<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.440> about<00:03:47.770> half

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
a for a quarter cup which is about half

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.040 
a for a quarter cup which is about half
a<00:03:48.490> gram<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.730> car<00:03:49.090> beer<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.600> little<00:03:49.930> less

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
a gram of car beer a little less

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.350 
a gram of car beer a little less
actually<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.710> we're<00:03:51.430> still<00:03:51.670> doing<00:03:51.790> very<00:03:52.120> well

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
actually but we're still doing very well

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.650 
actually but we're still doing very well
in<00:03:52.390> terms<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:53.020> carb<00:03:53.230> count<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.770> then<00:03:54.100> lastly

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
in terms of carb count and then lastly

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.070 
in terms of carb count and then lastly
I'm<00:03:55.660> going<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:56.290> add<00:03:56.530> some<00:03:57.630> Parmesan<00:03:58.630> cheese

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
I'm going to add some Parmesan cheese

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.600 
I'm going to add some Parmesan cheese
over<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.470> top<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.890> Parmesan<00:04:00.280> cheese<00:04:00.430> is

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
over the top and Parmesan cheese is

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.370 
over the top and Parmesan cheese is
great<00:04:00.820> because<00:04:01.000> in<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.780> quantities<00:04:02.170> we're

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
great because in the quantities we're

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.080 
great because in the quantities we're
using<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.800> effectively<00:04:02.980> doesn't<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.880> any

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
using it effectively doesn't have any

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.620 
using it effectively doesn't have any
carbs<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.170> can<00:04:05.380> use<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:07.180> don't<00:04:07.360> have<00:04:07.510> to
