00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
buy this on my zazzle shop but they seem

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
buy this on my zazzle shop but they seem
to<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.710> changed<00:00:37.770> their<00:00:38.309> notebook<00:00:38.730> options

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
to have changed their notebook options

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
to have changed their notebook options
to<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.870> having<00:00:40.079> lined<00:00:40.410> pages<00:00:40.680> instead<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to only having lined pages instead of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.979 
to only having lined pages instead of
having<00:00:41.730> both<00:00:42.059> lined<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.690> unlined<00:00:43.850> options

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
having both lined and unlined options

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
having both lined and unlined options
which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> unfortunate<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.370> took<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> down

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
which is unfortunate so I took that down

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.410 
which is unfortunate so I took that down
so<00:00:48.840> no<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.879> accidentally<00:00:50.879> by<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so no one would accidentally by one and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.090 
so no one would accidentally by one and
then<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.719> disappointed<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> lines

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
then be disappointed by all the lines

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.330 
then be disappointed by all the lines
