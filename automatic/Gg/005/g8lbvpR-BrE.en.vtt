the<00:00:13.349> drum<00:00:13.650> machine<00:00:13.769> never<00:00:14.309> seems<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> go<00:00:14.910> out

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the drum machine never seems to go out

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.359 
the drum machine never seems to go out
of<00:00:15.059> style<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.230> useful<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.890> minimal

drums with a step sequencer really gives

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.429 
drums with a step sequencer really gives
the<00:00:23.760> beat<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> certain<00:00:24.359> flavor<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.140> can't<00:00:25.350> be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the beat a certain flavor that can't be

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
the beat a certain flavor that can't be
denied<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.039> let's<00:00:26.760> dive<00:00:26.939> right<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.420> the

we<00:00:47.760> definitely<00:00:48.090> need<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:48.660> snare<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.349 

let's<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:56.960> yeah<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.359> sweet

let's see yeah this one will do it sweet
let's<00:01:01.199> start<00:01:01.500> sequencing<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.360> for<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
let's start sequencing I'm going for a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
let's start sequencing I'm going for a
kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> hip-hop<00:01:04.290> beat<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.949> 90<00:01:05.400> BPM<00:01:06.979> before

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
kind of hip-hop beat at 90 BPM before

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
kind of hip-hop beat at 90 BPM before
adding<00:01:08.369> notes<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> sequencer<00:01:09.509> let's<00:01:09.899> hit

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
adding notes in the sequencer let's hit

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
adding notes in the sequencer let's hit
run<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.940> hear<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.420> we're<00:01:12.570> doing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
run that way we hear what we're doing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.550 
run that way we hear what we're doing
right<00:01:13.170> away<00:01:14.060> okay<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.810> add<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> kick<00:01:16.229> here

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
right away okay let's add a kick here

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
right away okay let's add a kick here
and<00:01:16.729> here<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.759> sequence<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.330> snare

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and here and here to sequence the snare

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.779 
and here and here to sequence the snare
select<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.440> channel<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.039> just<00:01:23.340> add<00:01:23.549> some

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
select the channel and just add some

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.850 
select the channel and just add some
hits<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.180> step<00:01:24.450> 5<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.159> 13<00:01:26.600> classic<00:01:27.619> right<00:01:28.619> now

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
hits at step 5 and 13 classic right now

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880 
hits at step 5 and 13 classic right now
all<00:01:29.340> hits<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:30.030> exactly<00:01:30.539> as<00:01:30.720> loud<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.560> remedy

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
all hits are exactly as loud to remedy

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
all hits are exactly as loud to remedy
this<00:01:32.130> I'll<00:01:32.369> set<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> dynamic<00:01:33.600> selector<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this I'll set the dynamic selector to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.559 
this I'll set the dynamic selector to
soft<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> add<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.490> softer<00:01:35.970> kick<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.330> snare

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
soft and add some softer kick and snare

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.370 
soft and add some softer kick and snare
hits<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.869> basic

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
hits here and there so that's the basic

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050 
hits here and there so that's the basic
way<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.890> sequencing<00:01:44.460> Redrum

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
way of sequencing Redrum

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
way of sequencing Redrum
let's<00:01:45.720> spice<00:01:46.080> up<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.560> pattern<00:01:46.800> with<00:01:47.100> some

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
let's spice up this pattern with some

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.899 
let's spice up this pattern with some
high<00:01:47.460> hats<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:49.190> percussion<00:01:52.130> nice<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.789> get

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
high hats and percussion nice to get

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
high hats and percussion nice to get
some<00:01:54.149> groove<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.720> we'll<00:01:55.289> also<00:01:55.500> turn<00:01:55.830> on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
some groove going we'll also turn on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
some groove going we'll also turn on
shuffle<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.729> don't<00:01:59.789> like<00:02:00.060> about<00:02:00.330> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
shuffle one thing I don't like about the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.309 
shuffle one thing I don't like about the
high<00:02:00.989> hats<00:02:01.289> is<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.160> too<00:02:02.459> bright

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
high hats is it's a bit too bright

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.839 
high hats is it's a bit too bright
luckily<00:02:04.319> we<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.679> some<00:02:04.890> control<00:02:05.340> over<00:02:05.670> each

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
luckily we have some control over each

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.270 
luckily we have some control over each
sample<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.569> each<00:02:06.720> channel<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:07.920> just

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
sample on each channel so I can just

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.369 
sample on each channel so I can just
pitch<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> hi-hat<00:02:09.000> down<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:12.080> much<00:02:13.080> better

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
pitch the hi-hat down a bit much better

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.860 
pitch the hi-hat down a bit much better
with<00:02:14.310> Redrum<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> couple<00:02:15.629> of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
with Redrum there are a couple of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
with Redrum there are a couple of
different<00:02:16.230> ways<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.010> amazing

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
different ways to get your amazing

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.270 
different ways to get your amazing
sequenced<00:02:18.239> beat<00:02:18.629> from<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.349> rack<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:20.250> your

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
sequenced beat from your rack to your

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.420 
sequenced beat from your rack to your
track<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.900> let<00:02:22.080> Redrum<00:02:22.650> run<00:02:22.920> constantly

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
track you can let Redrum run constantly

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.059 
track you can let Redrum run constantly
in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.879> background<00:02:24.019> great<00:02:25.019> for<00:02:25.290> jamming<00:02:25.860> or

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
in the background great for jamming or

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:36.320 
in the background great for jamming or
guitar<00:02:26.459> practice<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:35.220> could<00:02:35.370> also<00:02:35.580> sequence

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
guitar practice you could also sequence

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.080 
guitar practice you could also sequence
pattern<00:02:36.599> changes<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:38.190> hit<00:02:38.340> record<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
pattern changes just hit record and
