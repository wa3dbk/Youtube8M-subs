what<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.690> debuting<00:01:01.170> about

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
what we're going to be debuting about

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
what we're going to be debuting about
late<00:01:02.190> q2<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.570> quad

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
late q2 so this is the first quad

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
late q2 so this is the first quad
antenna<00:01:04.339> router<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.970> releasing

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
antenna router that we will be releasing

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
antenna router that we will be releasing
which<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> new<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> 80<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
which is something that is new and 80 to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
which is something that is new and 80 to
let<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.670> standard<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> we'll<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> able<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
let me see standard and we'll be able to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
let me see standard and we'll be able to
split<00:01:11.040> maybe<00:01:11.340> three<00:01:11.580> antennas<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.150> device

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
split maybe three antennas to one device

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
split maybe three antennas to one device
one<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.930> another<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.470> two<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
one to another or two and two I'm so

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
one to another or two and two I'm so
pretty<00:01:15.810> exciting<00:01:16.110> development<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
pretty exciting development on so is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
pretty exciting development on so is
this<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.700> particularly<00:01:18.060> useful<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this going to be particularly useful in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
this going to be particularly useful in
situations<00:01:19.500> where<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.100> many<00:01:20.460> many

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
situations where you have many many

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
situations where you have many many
devices<00:01:20.939> connecting<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> like

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
devices connecting or is it more of like

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.980 
devices connecting or is it more of like
a<00:01:22.920> bandwidth<00:01:23.369> increase<00:01:23.759> it'll<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.689> more

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a bandwidth increase it'll be more

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
a bandwidth increase it'll be more
useful<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.560> being<00:01:25.799> able<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> manage<00:01:26.280> multiple

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
useful in being able to manage multiple

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
useful in being able to manage multiple
devices<00:01:26.909> multiple<00:01:27.299> devices<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> sort

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
devices multiple devices so you can sort

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
devices multiple devices so you can sort
of<00:01:28.350> segments<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.009> especially<00:01:29.840> probably

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of segments that out especially probably

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
of segments that out especially probably
helpful<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.290> areas<00:01:31.590> where<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> might<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
helpful in areas where you might have a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.890 
helpful in areas where you might have a
lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> other<00:01:32.970> wireless<00:01:33.390> traffic<00:01:33.600> going

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
lot of other wireless traffic going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200 
lot of other wireless traffic going
around<00:01:34.170> exactly<00:01:34.860> alright<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.820> antenna

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
around exactly alright so for antenna
