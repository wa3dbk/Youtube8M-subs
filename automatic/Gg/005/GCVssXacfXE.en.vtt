nothing else it's this a fast clock at

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.050 
nothing else it's this a fast clock at
least<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.170> least<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.529> fast<00:00:29.060> parrot

o'clock blues command in it what it
basically<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.510> doing<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.590> glass<00:00:34.829> here

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
basically is doing is some glass here

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically is doing is some glass here
for<00:00:35.190> demonstration<00:00:35.640> purposes<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.290> some

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
for demonstration purposes and some

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.830 
for demonstration purposes and some
yellow<00:00:37.500> glass<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> yellow<00:00:39.540> glass<00:00:41.629> is<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
yellow glass the yellow glass is the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.639 
yellow glass the yellow glass is the
player<00:00:44.480> first<00:00:45.480> thing<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> does<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.170> checks<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
player first thing it does it checks to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
player first thing it does it checks to
see<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.520> white<00:00:47.700> glasses<00:00:47.910> air<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
see if and white glasses air so it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
see if and white glasses air so it
checks<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> air

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
checks to see if this right here is air

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
checks to see if this right here is air
and<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.449> true<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.140> we'll<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and if that is true then we'll go on to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
and if that is true then we'll go on to
detect<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> air<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> true

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
detect if this is air and that is true

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
detect if this is air and that is true
we'll<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.760> check<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.239> locker<00:01:00.480> here

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
we'll go in and check this locker here

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
we'll go in and check this locker here
is<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.190> three<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> those<00:01:02.579> blocks

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
is there if all three of those blocks

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.329 
is there if all three of those blocks
believe<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.329> heir<00:01:03.480> meaning<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.189> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
believe you are heir meaning if you have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.530 
believe you are heir meaning if you have
a<00:01:05.369> blocker<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.000> great<00:01:07.400> here<00:01:08.540> then

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
a blocker right great here then

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
a blocker right great here then
otherwise<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.170> give<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> have

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
otherwise it just give you and you have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
otherwise it just give you and you have
these<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> wasn't<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> work

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
these two and it wasn't going to work

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
these two and it wasn't going to work
out<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.810> or<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.200> right

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
out very well or if you have one right

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
out very well or if you have one right
here<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> doesn't<00:01:17.369> quite<00:01:17.460> work<00:01:17.520> either<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
here that doesn't quite work either so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
here that doesn't quite work either so
need<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> check<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.110> three<00:01:19.409> years<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> row

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
need to check all three years in a row

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
need to check all three years in a row
and<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.119> Buffalo<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.409> then

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and that just Buffalo you because then

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.990 
and that just Buffalo you because then
you<00:01:22.650> could<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.979> be<00:01:25.979> jumping<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you could just you know be jumping that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.310 
you could just you know be jumping that
would<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.240> end<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.750> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> being

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
would actually end up kind of being

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
would actually end up kind of being
buggy<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> clicks<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.579> into<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> sky

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
buggy and clicks you up into the sky

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.980 
buggy and clicks you up into the sky
when<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> jump<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.140> weird<00:01:31.640> anyway<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> way

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
when you jump it's weird anyway the way

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.030 
when you jump it's weird anyway the way
this<00:01:34.140> works<00:01:34.759> essentially<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:37.040> dump

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this works essentially you have a dump

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
this works essentially you have a dump
boost<00:01:38.189> effect<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.549> 200<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.810> one

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
boost effect of 200 on you for one

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
boost effect of 200 on you for one
second<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.400> fact<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.180> will<00:01:42.270> give

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
second and then in fact that will give

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
second and then in fact that will give
you<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.630> enough<00:01:42.720> time<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.700> not<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.880> hurt<00:01:45.799> now

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you just enough time to not get hurt now

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
you just enough time to not get hurt now
I<00:01:46.829> got<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> figure<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.060> have

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I got to figure out here because I have

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
I got to figure out here because I have
those<00:01:48.360> three<00:01:48.540> blocks<00:01:48.840> crisis<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> go

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
those three blocks crisis here if I go

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
those three blocks crisis here if I go
like<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:53.030> there's<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.360> night<00:01:54.570> air<00:01:54.720> so

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
like this there's these night air so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.630 
like this there's these night air so
yeah<00:01:56.310> yeah<00:01:56.640> yeah<00:01:58.820> now<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> all<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
yeah yeah yeah now that all there and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520 
yeah yeah yeah now that all there and
you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.540> jump<00:02:03.810> boost<00:02:03.960> effective

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you can see I get jump boost effective

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
you can see I get jump boost effective
200<00:02:05.100> which<00:02:05.729> basically<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.149> can't<00:02:06.509> because

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
200 which basically just can't because
