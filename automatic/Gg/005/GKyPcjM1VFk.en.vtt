00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.380 

but<00:00:38.880> if<00:00:39.150> I<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.820> watch<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.150> you'll<00:00:42.360> see

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but if I do this watch here you'll see

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.430 
but if I do this watch here you'll see
the<00:00:42.630> blacks<00:00:42.900> right<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> brightest<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.960> got

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the blacks right the brightest just got

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100 
the blacks right the brightest just got
messed<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.760> happens<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.900> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
messed up and this happens only in this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.240 
messed up and this happens only in this
position<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.540> back<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:52.080> that<00:00:52.440> you'll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
position if I go back like that you'll

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.870 
position if I go back like that you'll
see<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> blacks<00:00:54.110> stay<00:00:55.110> black<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
see that the blacks stay black and if I

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.370 
see that the blacks stay black and if I
do<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.980> they<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.220> washed<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:02.000> here

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
do this they get washed out and here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.600 
do this they get washed out and here
they<00:01:04.380> are<00:01:04.410> perfect<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.230> the<00:01:07.380> only

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
they are perfect so this is the only

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
they are perfect so this is the only
down<00:01:08.610> side<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> panel<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
down side of the panel is that the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
down side of the panel is that the
viewing<00:01:11.340> angles<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.940> perfect<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.720> are

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
viewing angles are perfect when you are

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.000 
viewing angles are perfect when you are
perpendicular<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.280> phone<00:01:18.740> other<00:01:19.740> than

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
perpendicular to the phone other than

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.920 
perpendicular to the phone other than
that<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.119> great<00:01:21.360> panel

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that it's a really really great panel

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.880 
that it's a really really great panel
and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.890> did<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.160> comparison<00:01:24.710> against<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and I did a comparison against the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
and I did a comparison against the
samsung<00:01:26.280> omnia<00:01:26.460> outdoors<00:01:27.119> show<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
samsung omnia outdoors show you that the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
samsung omnia outdoors show you that the
performance<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.360> identical<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> Super<00:01:30.960> AMOLED

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
performance is identical to Super AMOLED

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.520 
performance is identical to Super AMOLED
panel<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:33.300> if<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.050> a<00:01:34.080> really<00:01:34.350> really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
panel so if you see that a really really

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
panel so if you see that a really really
great<00:01:34.740> job<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.970> to

great job right here so I'm going to
show<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.479> performs<00:01:39.590> compared<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
show you how it performs compared to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.040 
show you how it performs compared to
Super<00:01:43.200> AMOLED<00:01:44.330> which<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.660> and

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
Super AMOLED which is right here and

Super AMOLED which is right here and
it's<00:01:46.350> perfect<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.920> every<00:01:47.460> viewing<00:01:48.060> angles<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
it's perfect at every viewing angles and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.930 
it's perfect at every viewing angles and
it<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.920> perfect<00:01:50.429> blacks<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:52.009> for<00:01:53.009> LCD<00:01:53.490> panel

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
it has perfect blacks but for LCD panel

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.969 
it has perfect blacks but for LCD panel
this<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> best<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.530> I've<00:01:55.679> seen

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this is actually the best one I've seen

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.990 
this is actually the best one I've seen
if<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:57.300> don't<00:01:57.479> count<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.100> iphone<00:01:59.100> 4<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
if you don't count the iphone 4 but the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.410 
if you don't count the iphone 4 but the
screen<00:02:00.179> is<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:00.660> bit<00:02:00.929> too<00:02:01.050> small<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.500> me

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
screen is a little bit too small for me

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
angles you don't lose color reproduction

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
angles you don't lose color reproduction
it<00:02:12.780> only<00:02:13.050> gets<00:02:13.350> washed<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.520> look<00:02:14.700> at
