well this ship and my score just went up
to<00:02:09.849> one<00:02:11.459> there's<00:02:12.459> another<00:02:12.550> ship<00:02:13.440> too

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
to one there's another ship too

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.890 
to one there's another ship too
it's<00:02:15.819> just<00:02:16.000> weird<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> sound<00:02:16.720> just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
a dead end just like my life

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.470 
a dead end just like my life
another<00:02:23.230> boat<00:02:23.700> looks<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> cruise<00:02:25.269> ship

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
another boat looks like the cruise ship

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180 
another boat looks like the cruise ship
that<00:02:25.660> my<00:02:25.720> parents<00:02:26.110> going<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.440> every<00:02:26.680> year<00:02:26.830> well

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
it's a big yellow thing there the pool

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.979 
it's a big yellow thing there the pool
excuse<00:02:30.370> me<00:02:30.660> one<00:02:31.660> more<00:02:31.810> boats<00:02:32.049> score<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:33.989> now

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
excuse me one more boats score for now

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.930 
excuse me one more boats score for now
I'm<00:02:35.110> gonna<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.500> close<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.340> weird

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
I'm gonna go close to that weird

I'm gonna go close to that weird
Statutes<00:02:37.660> creeping<00:02:38.140> me<00:02:38.260> out

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
Statutes creeping me out

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.170 
Statutes creeping me out
and<00:02:38.910> then<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.030> assume<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.630> exit<00:02:42.180> level

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and then I assume this is the exit level

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.819 
and then I assume this is the exit level
complete<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.880> stinks<00:02:46.840> now<00:02:47.049> as<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.769> see

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
complete it stinks now as you can see

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.550 
complete it stinks now as you can see
the<00:02:48.250> technology<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.090> not<00:02:49.299> perfect<00:02:49.360> yet<00:02:50.140> but

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the technology is not perfect yet but

now<00:03:05.500> Angelina<00:03:06.010> has<00:03:06.220> made<00:03:06.430> many<00:03:06.700> games<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
now Angelina has made many games but the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.360 
now Angelina has made many games but the
game<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.049> just<00:03:08.319> played<00:03:08.560> was<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.130> first

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
game that I just played was the first

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.129 
game that I just played was the first
that<00:03:09.549> had<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> strict<00:03:10.120> theme<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:10.630> was<00:03:10.810> entered

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
that had a strict theme and was entered

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.110 
that had a strict theme and was entered
into<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> video<00:03:11.799> game<00:03:11.980> creation<00:03:12.430> contest

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
into a video game creation contest

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.569 
into a video game creation contest
competing<00:03:13.750> with<00:03:13.870> real<00:03:14.170> human<00:03:14.769> game<00:03:15.010> designers

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
competing with real human game designers

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.640

so<00:03:16.000> what<00:03:16.389> does<00:03:16.569> this<00:03:16.690> mean<00:03:16.930> for<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.200> future<00:03:17.620> of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
so what does this mean for the future of

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.610 
so what does this mean for the future of
game<00:03:17.950> design<00:03:18.340> well<00:03:18.639> perhaps<00:03:19.019> gaming<00:03:20.019> engines

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
game design well perhaps gaming engines

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.170 
game design well perhaps gaming engines
will<00:03:20.829> be<00:03:20.950> integrated<00:03:21.579> with<00:03:21.700> artificial

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
will be integrated with artificial

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.569 
will be integrated with artificial

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
intelligence like Angelina where game

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.520 
intelligence like Angelina where game

developers enter in the guidelines of
what<00:03:26.560> they<00:03:26.829> want<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.549> AI<00:03:27.730> does<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.540> rest

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
what they want and the AI does the rest

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.720 
what they want and the AI does the rest
possibly<00:03:29.590> creating<00:03:29.920> something<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.370> human
