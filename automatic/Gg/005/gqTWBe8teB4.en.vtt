00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
as you can see the sponge is like very

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
as you can see the sponge is like very
very<00:01:00.899> dense<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> kind<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.460> velvety<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
very dense and kind of velvety and this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
very dense and kind of velvety and this
is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> actual<00:01:04.500> foundation<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
is the actual foundation it's like a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.080 
is the actual foundation it's like a
sponge<00:01:06.630> inside<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> push

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sponge inside of here and when you push

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.140 
sponge inside of here and when you push
it<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.530> liquid<00:01:11.070> comes<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> surface

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it down the liquid comes to the surface

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830 
it down the liquid comes to the surface
onto<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.860> pad<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:15.000> case<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.450> finger

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
onto the pad or in my case my finger

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
onto the pad or in my case my finger
right<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
right now so that's what it looks like

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
right now so that's what it looks like
and<00:01:20.790> I'll<00:01:20.880> show<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.020> blends

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and I'll show you kind of how it blends

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.880 
and I'll show you kind of how it blends
in<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> foundation<00:01:27.689> itself<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.320> very

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in so the foundation itself is very very

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.210 
in so the foundation itself is very very
very<00:01:29.220> lightweight<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.390> quite<00:01:31.320> liquidy<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
very lightweight and quite liquidy on

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.030 
very lightweight and quite liquidy on
very<00:01:32.670> thin<00:01:33.000> consistency<00:01:33.650> buildable<00:01:34.650> coverage

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
very thin consistency buildable coverage

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.130 
very thin consistency buildable coverage
and<00:01:35.520> definitely<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.869> good

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and definitely I think it would be good

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.440 
and definitely I think it would be good
in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.470> summertime<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.700> hot<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in the summertime when it's hot and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
in the summertime when it's hot and
you're<00:01:39.720> sweaty<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.439> those<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.130> who<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you're sweaty or those of you who have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
you're sweaty or those of you who have
dry<00:01:41.909> skin<00:01:42.270> because<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:43.860> very

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
dry skin because this is very very

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.210 
dry skin because this is very very
moisturizing<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.689> BB<00:01:46.259> creams<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> does

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
moisturizing now like BB creams it does

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.149 
moisturizing now like BB creams it does
have<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.939> slight<00:01:48.390> grey<00:01:49.079> cast<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.100> don't

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
have a slight grey cast to it I don't

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.649 
have a slight grey cast to it I don't
know<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.000> my<00:01:51.119> hand<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.420> just

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
know if you can see it on my hand I just

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.749 
know if you can see it on my hand I just
put<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.320> over<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.920> head<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.520> think

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
put it all over my head and I think

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
put it all over my head and I think
that's<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.450> has<00:01:54.689> sun<00:01:55.020> block<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that's because it has sun block in it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
that's because it has sun block in it
but<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.340> wear<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.119> soaks

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
but as you wear it and kind of soaks

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.959 
but as you wear it and kind of soaks
