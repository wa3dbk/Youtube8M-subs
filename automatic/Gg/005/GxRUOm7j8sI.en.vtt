the roast and he's got this big chunk of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.770 
the roast and he's got this big chunk of
skin<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> side<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> could<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
skin on the side here and you could you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590 
skin on the side here and you could you
could<00:00:36.930> peel<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> off<00:00:37.320> prior<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.239> cooking<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
could peel that off prior to cooking it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
could peel that off prior to cooking it
but<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.620> been<00:00:40.829> bound<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.250> string<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but it's been bound with string here so

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.459 
but it's been bound with string here so
if<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> take<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.469> fall

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
if I take this off it is going to fall

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.720 
if I take this off it is going to fall
apart<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.520> leave<00:00:47.700> it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
apart so we're going to just leave it
together<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> remove<00:00:49.050> that

325<00:04:17.239> degrees<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.480> about<00:04:18.570> an<00:04:18.690> hour<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.769> I'm

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
325 degrees for about an hour then I'm

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.550 
325 degrees for about an hour then I'm
gonna<00:04:20.040> add<00:04:20.250> carrots<00:04:20.900> cook<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.109> for<00:04:22.410> another

gonna add carrots cook that for another

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.030 
gonna add carrots cook that for another

hour and then I'm going to add potatoes
so<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:27.150> reason<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.510> cook<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.020> long<00:04:28.229> is<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so the reason I cook it so long is that

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560 
so the reason I cook it so long is that
my<00:04:28.650> husband<00:04:29.010> prefers<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.520> roast<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.940> be<00:04:30.060> very

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
my husband prefers the roast to be very

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.290 
my husband prefers the roast to be very
well<00:04:30.810> cooked<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.410> falling<00:04:32.250> apart<00:04:32.550> one<00:04:33.060> that's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
well cooked and falling apart one that's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.230 
well cooked and falling apart one that's
his<00:04:33.479> favorite<00:04:33.870> way<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.020> eating<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.500> so

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
his favorite way of eating it so

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.340 
his favorite way of eating it so
obviously<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.390> don't<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.630> cook<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.080> long

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
obviously you don't to cook it that long

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.159 
obviously you don't to cook it that long
for<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:37.979> be<00:04:38.100> true<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:38.940> that's<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.900> way<00:04:40.020> we

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
for it to be true but that's the way we

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:40.550 
for it to be true but that's the way we
like<00:04:40.320> it

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
like it

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.680 
like it
so<00:04:40.919> I'll<00:04:41.640> let<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.880> see<00:04:42.270> what<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.450> looks<00:04:42.600> like

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
so I'll let you see what it looks like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.320 
so I'll let you see what it looks like
