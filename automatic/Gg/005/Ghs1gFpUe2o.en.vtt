00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.299
 hello to all welcome to 7 695 from 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.450
 beefy then we're in a crate 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:22.320
 running jaw box only 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.289
 so that's the positive there are 2,500 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.449
 ultimate version at ultimate sport what there 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:36.809
 we are we have 190 horses 25 meters 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:40.449
 who the other couple of 130 in max speed 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.909
 997 kg in division a ton and a 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.489
 dog box what is not done on 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.629
 road cars normally but 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.940
 this bartha case is so awesome and then 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.640
 a self-blocking 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.049
 we will see if it works well and the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.589
 Brakes Brembo racing rims ago 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.589
 everything that goes well 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 small motor a lead four compressors 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.409
 on your walking really god fire 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.409
 it starts from almost everything down 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.190
 i can tell you that satan not expected 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.490
 not that the chassis is really that has 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 not look 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.930
 actually in this tower to see 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 for the brakes on the effort place well 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.160
 before then we are on a small circuit 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.370
 today the circle two happy and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.370
 [Music] 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.720
 car circuit should better 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.720
 speak out 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.170
 so we put sport version on admire 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.100
 the correction has 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 hop there 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.520
 it turns to his outfit ultra well it's 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.520
 really a great little player 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.360
 it's to see if it puts you in place 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.360
 small shot by cons 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 the aids the driving aids are 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.870
 no branches has completely and we have 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.830
 always even in sport version we have 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.020
 always the recognizable sp 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.240
 unfortunately we should have taken the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.940
 fuse but I have no right to the 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.190
 argue otherwise that I think that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.380
 was stopping for me it's a car 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.290
 that they roll absolutely without 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.470
 none of the twenty ten the box is the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.629
 madness 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 the box an option of my listening 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.510
 which costs an arm the box where a lot 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.480
 from 10000 euros 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.950
 on the other hand 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.909
 it goes to the videographer you m running 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.909
 we can not do better 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.830
 very good after when my effort 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.930
 on hay there are always 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.420
 warnings that gets the pop then be 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.260
 does well but especially the braking and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.260
 the famous warnings 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.480
 and it's really a car 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.920
 it's really a car for a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.210
 break and pull with this abatement 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.990
 it's really a super car 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.440
 I'm packed it's super small 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.440
 piece may 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.430
 I had tested the previous model good 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.000
 month 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.609
 - sporty on the roads above 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.469
 from them over canes on the roads 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.879
 turini and it had turned out 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.980
 extraordinary but this one it must 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.859
 to be really a pleasure a wii and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.859
 that it would take a car that has its 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.590
 place on the mountain roads and there 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.590
 where do you ruptures universo spel all that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.489
 it must be his place are actually 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.510
 not the ideal place fetish place 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.219
 the car is well balanced 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.379
 we would like the rear axle because 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.959
 I have more but frankly it's 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.109
 not bad and the self-locking does 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:14.340
 that the very fine his job serves to 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.500
 skating really worth it's very 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 very well 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 Congress 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.010
 [Music] 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.390
 just think if you leave this car a 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.980
 disconnected I think it's the fuse 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.190
 thirty and a few but we get 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.990
 will inform the metra on the site 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.970
 you have to leave by disconnecting the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.580
 fuse it's too much it's too frustrating 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.420
 to not be able to put it across 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.420
 and in paris 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.950
 where you go right from the conages his 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.160
 fans and every time we went the 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.350
 frames or they block the way there one 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.340
 we have the sp that bother us for 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.410
 come out but it's extraordinary 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.410
 [Music] 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.920
 good so it's overpriced at 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.930
 the story but so has sixty seven 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.120
 thousand euros it's really expensive 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.420
 on the other hand it's very very successful 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.540
 those who can afford it why 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.540
 not
