00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and and recognizing the universe is much

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
and and recognizing the universe is much
more<00:00:44.940> complex<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.070> magnificent<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.280> our

understanding<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.690> ever<00:00:51.980> let<00:00:52.980> us

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
understanding would have ever let us

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.180 
understanding would have ever let us
imagine<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:55.980> that's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
imagine and so that you're right that's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
imagine and so that you're right that's
the<00:00:56.430> intuitive<00:00:56.940> aspect<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the intuitive aspect of it and but the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
the intuitive aspect of it and but the
real<00:00:59.609> question<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> been

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
real question here that we have been

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
real question here that we have been
addressing<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.730> been<00:01:02.910> visited<00:01:02.969> are

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
addressing is have we been visited are

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.649 
addressing is have we been visited are
we<00:01:04.670> since<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> spacefaring

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we since we are now a spacefaring

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.560 
we since we are now a spacefaring
civilization<00:01:07.650> having<00:01:08.460> only<00:01:08.790> gone<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.390> own

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
civilization having only gone to our own

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.800 
civilization having only gone to our own
moon<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.430> visitors<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
moon but have our visitors are the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
moon but have our visitors are the
aliens<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> us<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> all<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
aliens have they come to us and all the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.870 
aliens have they come to us and all the
evidence<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.479> yes<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
evidence is yes so what is it that you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.300 
evidence is yes so what is it that you
want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> Obama<00:01:19.310> administration

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
want to see the Obama administration
