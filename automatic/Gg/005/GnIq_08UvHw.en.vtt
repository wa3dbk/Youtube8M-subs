00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.340
 b 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.500
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.980
 Another video of me is my name 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.740
 bond 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 you're at get over keyword this 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.669
 is a video on the topic of the meter go that 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.980
 is playing merrily reason only natural 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.210
 or 2 but you can get the word meter 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.100
 actually give up pretty much 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.150
 Respectively 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.590
 why am I doing this a video was 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.769
 quite a few people among ours 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.930
 beginner guide videos the so to speak the 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.150
 beginner is so stressed because that later 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.860
 but it will be pretty important 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.660
 all the time wondering hey why does he 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.890
 not to go hey why go 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.090
 always do not care about this weather 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 meant is not up to date with the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.070
 give metal and and and and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:57.199
 and also such questions and I say 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.340
 I would like to have smaller suggestions for correction 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.620
 to enter at this point 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.260
 First of all, what is the lunch hour ? 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.380
 im describes the circumstance like a game 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 or a certain aspect of the game itself 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.700
 changes over time 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.770
 patches through things that you about the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.319
 find out and and and and and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.890
 walking is more or less 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:21.410
 if one of these hip words 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
 wants to express a so-called trend 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.300
 that is a style and a trend 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 Wise as the worst pos this game 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.720
 It is now his turn to show him 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.910
 that's what you could call it, yes, where from 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.860
 That's why it comes through patches 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.750
 anything is changed or to 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 example that some things are complete 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 change from the metal 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.869
 small example of pot 2 in the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.300
 beta and also at the beginning of the game 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.099
 rogers still cost two more train 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.720
 now cost the second broke since 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.050
 actually the beginning of the time tuesday 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.640
 on two shelf and this has become one 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.520
 new mother gm developed by it 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.920
 had to be measured differently 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.509
 as well as some things about 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.190
 passage of time has been changed to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.690
 give new meter gets things 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.170
 example, since today I'm next 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.640
 was changed and and and and and im 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.459
 The end effect is caused by instruction 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.560
 the top layers of the pos 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.340
 A trend is emerging and everyone is doing it 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.720
 it to 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.180
 Well of course now the question in 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 Danger is worth it I say so 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.900
 I had such a small one best 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 story that happened to me then 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.920
 different maybe better what I am 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.989
 my 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.730
 colleague of mine has with me 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.530
 started playing on day and time 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.760
 he was overwhelmed with it at the same time 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.560
 two buttons to press so that we 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.019
 really just one of those at the same time 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.299
 go or chew gum but can stop 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.670
 not simultaneously that can only go 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.980
 or comedian if that would do it 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.010
 reporter job overturned I have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.489
 nothing against no matter and he meant then 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.260
 to me and that I found so interesting 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.730
 At that time there were 16 players I 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.840
 Spanish was the karmann with one 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.549
 complete new way to play so 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 Absolutely new absolutely exciting and that 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.480
 I also want to tell him you age 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.489
 can not even press two buttons 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.260
 first learn the basic mechanics 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.849
 of the game and after that takes care of 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.610
 some fucking right now in the trend 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.530
 Ninth, I want to do that and that 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.489
 That is why we in our video 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.319
 actually come on meter 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.370
 Enter with results existed in parallel 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.819
 say to the current standard gameplay 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.100
 me once 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.920
 best example maybe sticks 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.889
 let or as I in the and who for 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.870
 endotag-1 andrack you can of course 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:37.040
 At the moment, the meter will be standard 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.980
 on foot and play with words the model 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.359
 the whole podium and and and and and or 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.730
 You can play here as in all 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.579
 normal people are playing on the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.169
 mips and so nazi with carey or 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.489
 to play something like that has new cars 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.859
 Something both goes and only real 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.319
 pos or people are really 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.459
 deal with the game extremely 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.900
 Understand why you are currently playing 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.579
 somebody plays that sometimes 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.650
 small percentage sometimes 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.410
 differences of maybe ten damage 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.660
 on level 7 or so what the really that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.569
 decisive benchmarks for this are 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.709
 normal people normal mortal people the 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.329
 a little bit with the game 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.400
 I am difficult anyway 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.500
 not bad because then go something like that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.389
 never notice for us it is not 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.729
 important to pay attention to the medium 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.280
 it does not matter you do not 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.900
 crazy and very important in that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.880
 we as a tenant would enter 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.070
 what we would do because if we so 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.660
 many simply beginners confusing because 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.220
 the people think 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.470
 I just had to live my whole life 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.240
 From the pc spend the sender that itself 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.120
 every five seconds must be somewhere 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.470
 new trend registrars the sequence 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 these things you meters in the net 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.410
 This creates the worst pros 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.840
 moscow five as well as the navi dignitas 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.340
 as they are not all called 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.200
 at first things out in the game 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.400
 find the ones changed by patches 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.500
 and then they pick theirs 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.420
 calculator statements on level 12 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.460
 get power with this and this new one 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.770
 skills in these new items in the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.810
 have garden only considered 11 more harm 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.090
 I notice that these eleven damage notice 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.520
 the positive noted in the pulls 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.290
 every harm done to us 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.000
 normal mortals but does not make you 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.770
 Do not go crazy by the meter 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.630
 do not run around and say 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.420
 No, I'm not allowed to do this hero anymore 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.740
 I can not play anymore 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.570
 these are making the meter type 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.990
 used meters do not give more than 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.360
 excuse somehow all this dirt away 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.960
 I really hilfswerk got it I have 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.310
 The school is not so july 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.810
 Do not talk that is meta game 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.450
 give this is nice for the people 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.220
 that are about the pro and that are in 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.150
 quotes can afford 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.370
 weather is going to pay attention 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.990
 but do not go crazy meter 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.570
 give you will already own with 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.400
 get by simply I tell my 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.350
 for example that with the tri lane 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.850
 you can do that you have to do that 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.320
 but do not happen since where the 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.180
 people do that then makes time to time 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.600
 so you get the big trends like this or 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.100
 so with 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.320
 but you do not have to do that now 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.210
 employ and very important calls 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.820
 that will not be under each video we will 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.580
 do not enter the meter because the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.730
 people the people we are ours 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.890
 videos are aimed at beginners who will only 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.530
 confused and honestly people themselves 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.110
 which are at about a level and how 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.700
 I said I was in the top 10 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.520
 actually among the top seven best 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.790
 place of germany in the esl vm though 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.260
 But only then was hauser jacket 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.370
 like pants 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.530
 I'm not bad I say 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.700
 no case that I'm good me and so 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.300
 on 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.590
 average player maybe 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.120
 maybe something is better 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.930
 average and me that is 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.090
 I do not give a shit 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.680
 So as long as you do not say that you 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.690
 1000 times better that me and I know 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.580
 every one that is a good billion 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.100
 times better than me because the biggest club 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.480
 as long as you do not say that for so long 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.140
 Do not mess with the medium 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.390
 employ 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.800
 that were my thoughts about it 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.940
 Of course, write under this video 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.130
 whatever you want you can break me 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.140
 flame as I dare to be here 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.370
 people so important note on the meter 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.310
 to share 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.380
 but if they can do it better 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.030
 simply make videos yourself to the sender 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.030
 guys until next time and ciao
