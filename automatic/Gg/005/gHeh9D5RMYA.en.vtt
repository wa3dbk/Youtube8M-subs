00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the season was released and we did

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
the season was released and we did
indeed<00:00:34.890> find<00:00:34.920> ATM<00:00:35.580> season<00:00:36.030> hazard<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.570> i

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
indeed find ATM season hazard as i

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.560 
indeed find ATM season hazard as i
expected<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.860> he<00:00:37.920> isn't<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.400> right<00:00:38.610> mid<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> at

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
expected now he isn't a right mid and at

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.389 
expected now he isn't a right mid and at
the<00:00:39.660> day<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.230> he<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.440> released<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.250> went

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the day that he was released you went

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880 
the day that he was released you went
for<00:00:41.610> roughly<00:00:41.880> 1.3<00:00:42.510> million<00:00:42.989> coins<00:00:43.380> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> ps3

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
for roughly 1.3 million coins on the ps3

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.580 
for roughly 1.3 million coins on the ps3
so<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.390> roughly<00:00:46.079> looking<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so that's what we are roughly looking to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
so that's what we are roughly looking to
trade<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> course<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.640> hopefully<00:00:48.510> for

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
trade to of course he will hopefully for

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.250 
trade to of course he will hopefully for
us<00:00:48.809> drop<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.450> over<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.960> time

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to pick him up a little bit cheaper than

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.280 
to pick him up a little bit cheaper than
that<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.090> we'll<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.390> how<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.629> turns<00:00:57.840> out

man CDM info 12 until we picked it up
for<00:05:34.650> 15,000<00:05:35.640> looking<00:05:36.120> sell<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.480> on<00:05:36.570> for<00:05:36.780> twenty

for 15,000 looking sell it on for twenty

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.960 
for 15,000 looking sell it on for twenty
thousand<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:37.650> that's<00:05:37.800> about<00:05:37.920> a<00:05:38.010> 5k<00:05:38.460> profit<00:05:38.880> if

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
thousand so that's about a 5k profit if

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.750 
thousand so that's about a 5k profit if
we<00:05:39.060> take<00:05:39.360> away<00:05:39.540> text<00:05:40.080> roughly<00:05:40.920> up<00:05:41.040> with<00:05:41.160> 4k<00:05:41.700> so

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
we take away text roughly up with 4k so

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.190 
we take away text roughly up with 4k so
that's<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.120> pretty<00:05:42.360> nice<00:05:42.540> profit<00:05:42.900> in<00:05:43.050> my

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
that's a pretty nice profit in my

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.950 
that's a pretty nice profit in my
opinion<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.860> it's<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.730> second<00:05:45.300> inform<00:05:45.690> we

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
opinion and it's the second inform we

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.320 
opinion and it's the second inform we
picked<00:05:46.260> up<00:05:46.410> as<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.680> lucas<00:05:47.070> whole<00:05:47.310> beat<00:05:47.550> or<00:05:47.760> lewis

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
picked up as a lucas whole beat or lewis

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.210 
picked up as a lucas whole beat or lewis
holtby<00:05:48.510> i<00:05:48.690> think<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.290> center<00:05:49.800> forward

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
holtby i think it is in center forward

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.390 
holtby i think it is in center forward
and<00:05:50.370> we<00:05:51.210> picked<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.840> up<00:05:51.870> for<00:05:52.280> 19,500<00:05:53.280> Emma

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
and we picked it up for 19,500 Emma

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.700 
and we picked it up for 19,500 Emma
looks<00:05:53.670> alone<00:05:53.880> for<00:05:54.150> 24<00:05:54.720> K<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.380> that's<00:05:55.530> also

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
looks alone for 24 K so that's also

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.680 
looks alone for 24 K so that's also
about<00:05:55.950> afford<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.610> 5k<00:05:57.000> profit<00:05:57.420> so<00:05:57.510> there's

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
about afford to 5k profit so there's

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.510 
about afford to 5k profit so there's
pretty<00:05:57.930> good<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.200> my<00:05:58.380> opinion<00:05:58.410> but<00:05:59.250> this<00:05:59.430> has

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520
