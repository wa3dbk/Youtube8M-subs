00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.810 

there<00:03:37.620> were<00:03:37.739> some<00:03:37.950> great<00:03:38.100> things<00:03:38.459> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
there were some great things and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.520 
there were some great things and
coachable<00:03:39.390> things<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:39.930> able<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.200> pick<00:03:40.380> up

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
coachable things I was able to pick up

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.960 
coachable things I was able to pick up
on<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.040> video<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.400> things<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.730> want<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
on in this video and things I want to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.729 
on in this video and things I want to
see<00:03:42.090> them<00:03:42.239> get<00:03:42.390> better<00:03:42.660> at<00:03:42.900> as<00:03:43.049> they<00:03:43.530> move

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
see them get better at as they move

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.500 
see them get better at as they move
forward<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.250> overall<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.730> say<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.390> an

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
forward but overall I say this was an

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.870 
forward but overall I say this was an
even<00:03:45.900> matchup<00:03:46.110> watching<00:03:46.950> both<00:03:47.130> guys<00:03:47.370> compete

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
even matchup watching both guys compete

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.190 
even matchup watching both guys compete
against<00:03:48.120> one<00:03:48.209> another<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.870> see<00:03:49.049> why

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
against one another you can see why

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.900 
against one another you can see why
they're<00:03:49.410> both<00:03:49.590> highly<00:03:49.799> thought<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.220> entering

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
they're both highly thought of entering

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.960 
they're both highly thought of entering
the<00:03:51.180> 2015<00:03:52.080> season<00:03:52.110> both<00:03:53.100> players<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.670> believe

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
the 2015 season both players I believe

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.350 
the 2015 season both players I believe
have<00:03:54.180> really<00:03:54.600> bright<00:03:54.870> futures
