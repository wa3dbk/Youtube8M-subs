I have a better idea

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.629 
I have a better idea
so<00:04:30.910> why<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.120> raise<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.780> much<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.639> these

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
erasers are really dope I got two

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.339 
erasers are really dope I got two
binders<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.699> going<00:04:37.120> into<00:04:37.479> great<00:04:37.810> mountain<00:04:38.169> so

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
binders I'm going into great mountain so

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.810 
binders I'm going into great mountain so
I<00:04:38.440> wasn't<00:04:38.800> quite<00:04:38.949> sure<00:04:38.979> what<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.460> would<00:04:39.669> need

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
I wasn't quite sure what I would need

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.580 
I wasn't quite sure what I would need
because<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.240> am<00:04:40.330> going<00:04:40.509> to<00:04:40.690> high<00:04:40.810> school<00:04:40.840> but<00:04:41.560> I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
because I am going to high school but I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.200 
because I am going to high school but I
just<00:04:41.680> thought<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.340> two<00:04:42.550> binders<00:04:42.910> would<00:04:43.090> do

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
just thought that two binders would do

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.589 
just thought that two binders would do
me<00:04:43.360> good

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
me good

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.270 
me good
so<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> first<00:04:44.139> liner<00:04:44.380> that<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.650> got<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.039> just

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
so the first liner that I got is just

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.060 
so the first liner that I got is just
like<00:04:45.460> really<00:04:45.940> pretty<00:04:46.720> coral<00:04:47.199> called<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
like really pretty coral called the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.370 
like really pretty coral called the
little<00:04:48.370> slip<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.509> here<00:04:49.720> so<00:04:49.870> if<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.050> wanted<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
little slip in here so if I wanted to

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.620 
little slip in here so if I wanted to
make<00:04:51.039> it<00:04:51.220> close<00:04:51.550> or<00:04:51.820> something<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.330> spice<00:04:52.570> it

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
make it close or something to spice it

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.029 
make it close or something to spice it
up<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.080> definitely<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.699> comes<00:04:55.030> with

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
up I definitely can and this comes with

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.010 
up I definitely can and this comes with
it<00:04:57.039> comes<00:04:57.280> with<00:04:57.460> dividers<00:04:57.789> which<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:58.840> nice

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
it comes with dividers which is so nice

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.230
