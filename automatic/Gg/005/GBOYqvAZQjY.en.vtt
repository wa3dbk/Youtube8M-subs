 Arno Kupka offers uphill optional spoiler 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.579
 to the identification mark of the m-models 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.669
 many flood the geest trumpets tube 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.449
 sporty and comfortable 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.240
 the seats in row one 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 this is the whole interior of the 3 Series Coupe s 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 when technology in series 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.510
 Single throttle v8 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.960
 the price per ounce after 61 00 euros 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.330
 There are 420 hp for that, if you want to walk free to 280 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 Werder he is by itself already very spectacular vehicle 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 but speed up with the Launch Control 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.940
 something very special 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 over all vehicles de sowas bodies have as certain the procedure to that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.370
 means I have to go out first needs EUR 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.430
 the switches 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 the first 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 completely off 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 I want here 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.540
 a corresponding gross margin globe 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 because that leaves something 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.390
 I just wanted to go from Goslar back then to their new name 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.020
 in some way 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 that is exactly what you always do 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.210
 faster than the factory specification 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.610
 a lot of grief 5 seconds for the standard sprint 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.899
 No on 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 who slows down later 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 if you see that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.400
 that will be pretty official too 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 35 Kamber 3 tenants from one hundred to zero 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.509
 sm-3 Mosimann clean Size No 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.519
 a bit over 60 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.629
 the run over 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.119
 Johann Schmalhofer 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.209
 Lammert 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.229
 Premium gasoline will be around in the apartment 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.619
 next to the US keep Warnecke 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.709
 the big selection answer 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 not only the best she drove that very easy 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.429
 almost 70 km / h 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.429
 simply proven 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.400
 the transfer rates of the EM spreads its go on the racetracks of the world 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.780
 and forms the basis for the motorsport success of the Munich that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.239
 Recipe for success the starting point 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.489
 the others should be supposed to appear is the APA I have my opinion 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.079
 the citizen 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.789
 so that our readers of the one-world-laden voters off 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:07.479
 now waiting for the next corner 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.659
 I think now finally more so even further 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.120
 It was very warm in the clean garden furniture and indiscriminate Leo 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.299
 Schrell 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.659
 new York 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.209
 then I say 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 about Bella's touring car and that we should turn off 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.249
 Raabe 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.249
 very pregnant Zingler 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 Vienna 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.149
 After a threesome we would be so good 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.459
 which will probably be the last time 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.579
 and that one can get high, the eight-cylinder even a set ball 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.670
 USD while in the truest sense of the word expensive are over 8000 rpm 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.919
 is extremely bright for Borrmann street sports cars if advertise here 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.289
 To hold the century 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.000
 sometimes time yes and Andy Warhol's persons 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.049
 Address teachers or relatives 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.820
 Either way, you have the evening 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.770
 directly injured the accelerator b 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.730
 I'm proud to be part of the rental self thanks to four seats and 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.029
 Trunk does not need a private race track 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.639
 although a court appearance allowed TERA 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.389
 nothing stands in the way of dogan
