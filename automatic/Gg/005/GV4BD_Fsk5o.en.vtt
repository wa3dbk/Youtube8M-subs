paint effect there's a couple things we
need<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> note<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.020> you're<00:00:40.260> rendering<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.829> Maya

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
need to note if you're rendering in Maya

what<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.640> means<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:47.940> us<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.450> lights<00:00:49.200> will

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
what that means for us is lights will

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
what that means for us is lights will
affect<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> differently<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.730> effects<00:00:51.090> will

such as
ray<00:00:56.310> tracing<00:00:56.990> so<00:00:57.990> it<00:00:58.740> is<00:00:58.950> not<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.460> uncommon

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
ray tracing so it is not really uncommon

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.050 
ray tracing so it is not really uncommon
for<00:01:00.210> productions<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.400> create<00:01:02.400> separate<00:01:02.760> scene

something<00:01:17.220> called<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.580> hair<00:01:17.910> primitive

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
something called a hair primitive

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
something called a hair primitive
doesn't<00:01:19.380> automatically<00:01:19.920> absolutely<00:01:20.820> nothing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
doesn't automatically absolutely nothing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.000 
doesn't automatically absolutely nothing
going<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.660> so<00:01:22.200> there's<00:01:22.560> nothing<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.800> worry

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
going on so there's nothing to worry

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.500 
going on so there's nothing to worry
about<00:01:23.930> now<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.010> paint<00:01:26.190> effect<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
about now because it's a paint effect is

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.780 
about now because it's a paint effect is
very<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.320> dependent<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.310> I'll<00:01:29.490> show<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
very you be dependent like I'll show you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
very you be dependent like I'll show you
here<00:01:29.940> shortly<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.200> scene<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
here shortly like in this scene you can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.969 
here shortly like in this scene you can
see<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.250> plane<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:33.590> two<00:01:34.590> subdivisions

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
see I have a plane with two subdivisions

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.840 
see I have a plane with two subdivisions
on<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:36.150> each<00:01:36.540> son<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> UV<00:01:38.280> texture<00:01:38.550> open

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
on on each son and I the UV texture open

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.680 
on on each son and I the UV texture open
as<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.080> well<00:01:40.740> drawn<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.690> 2021

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
as you can see it is well drawn in 2021

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.830 
as you can see it is well drawn in 2021
space<00:01:43.970> because<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> plane<00:01:45.360> rather<00:01:45.600> easily

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
space because it's a plane rather easily

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.750 
space because it's a plane rather easily
and<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> apply<00:01:48.020> some<00:01:49.020> hair<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.410> it<00:01:49.760> you'll

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
and when I apply some hair to it you'll

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.500 
and when I apply some hair to it you'll
take<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> second<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.950> situation

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
take a second because of the situation

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.770 
take a second because of the situation
but<00:01:54.510> you'll<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> planes<00:01:55.440> here<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
but you'll see that the planes here and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.030 
but you'll see that the planes here and
the<00:01:57.780> hair<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.700> rendered<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.179> 01<00:02:00.600> space

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the hair is rendered out in the 01 space

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.690 
the hair is rendered out in the 01 space
now<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.910> like<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.330> explain<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
now I like to explain that it is in the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
now I like to explain that it is in the
01<00:02:06.150> space<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> hair<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> drawn<00:02:07.380> not

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
01 space that the hair is drawn not

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
01 space that the hair is drawn not
necessarily<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.720> 3d<00:02:10.050> field<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.820> i<00:02:12.000> just

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
necessarily on the 3d field so if i just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.320 
necessarily on the 3d field so if i just
select<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.810> UV<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.760> move<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.210> will

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
select the UV and move it you will

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.870 
select the UV and move it you will
notice<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.500> top<00:02:16.800> right<00:02:16.980> corner<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
notice that on the top right corner the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.130 
notice that on the top right corner the
hair<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.180> disappearing<00:02:20.660> that's<00:02:21.660> because<00:02:21.960> like

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
hair is disappearing that's because like

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.210 
hair is disappearing that's because like
i<00:02:22.230> said<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:23.130> drawn<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.000> texture<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:26.070> i

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
i said is drawn and the texture and if i

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
i said is drawn and the texture and if i
move<00:02:26.370> out<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> 01<00:02:27.480> space<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:28.050> completely

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
move out at the 01 space a completely

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.310 
move out at the 01 space a completely
vanishes<00:02:29.130> minus<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.910> small<00:02:30.240> artifact<00:02:31.140> right

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
vanishes minus that small artifact right

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.380 
vanishes minus that small artifact right
there<00:02:32.330> now<00:02:33.330> i'm<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> open<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.870> scene<00:02:34.050> file

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.540 

that<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.620> further<00:02:37.800> demonstrate<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that is going to further demonstrate the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
that is going to further demonstrate the
importance<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.180> UV<00:02:39.720> rapid<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.230> some

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
importance of UV rapid and some

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.670 
importance of UV rapid and some
limitations<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.459> people<00:02:41.760> may<00:02:41.880> use<00:02:42.470> now<00:02:43.470> as

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
limitations that people may use now as

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.580 
limitations that people may use now as
you<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.610> cube<00:02:45.590> nothing

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you can see here I have a cube nothing

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770 
you can see here I have a cube nothing
fancy<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> you've<00:02:47.819> each<00:02:47.940> test<00:02:48.540> run

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
fancy I just have a you've each test run

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.530 
fancy I just have a you've each test run
it<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> same<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
it as you can see it is the same all the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360 
it as you can see it is the same all the
way<00:02:51.630> around<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.740> UV<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.220> all

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
way around that is because the UV is all

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.640 
way around that is because the UV is all
piled<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.880> top<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.150> each<00:02:54.390> other

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.949 

now<00:02:57.189> if<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.519> apply<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.849> hair<00:02:58.239> what<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:58.900> is

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
now if I apply the hair what thing is

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:59.880 
now if I apply the hair what thing is
going<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.110> happen<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.530> going<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> cover

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
going to happen it's going to cover

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.410 
going to happen it's going to cover
everything<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.879> not<00:03:01.030> gonna<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.239> anything

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
everything is it not gonna do anything

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.610 
everything is it not gonna do anything
at<00:03:01.599> all<00:03:02.010> well<00:03:03.010> let's<00:03:03.610> find<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:04.379> after<00:03:05.379> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
at all well let's find out after a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.280 
at all well let's find out after a
couple<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:05.980> seconds<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:07.629> can<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:07.959> it's

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
couple of seconds you can see that it's

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.410 
couple of seconds you can see that it's
only<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:09.040> one<00:03:09.069> side<00:03:09.250> I'll<00:03:09.610> even<00:03:09.760> turn<00:03:10.060> off<00:03:10.239> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
only on one side I'll even turn off the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.920 
only on one side I'll even turn off the
texture<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.379> you<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:11.799> faster<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.310> easier

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
texture so you can see faster and easier

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.289 
texture so you can see faster and easier
it<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:13.989> only<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.799> one<00:03:15.040> side<00:03:15.069> now<00:03:15.879> why<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
it is only on one side now why is that

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.300 
it is only on one side now why is that
well<00:03:17.290> because<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.579> drawn<00:03:18.819> in<00:03:19.150> 01<00:03:19.780> space<00:03:20.019> only

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
well because it's drawn in 01 space only

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.190 
well because it's drawn in 01 space only
with<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.489> being<00:03:21.730> said<00:03:21.819> if<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.510> select<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
with that being said if I select the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.710 
with that being said if I select the
face<00:03:23.439> and<00:03:24.189> then<00:03:24.700> go<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:24.939> UVA<00:03:25.239> start<00:03:25.480> moving

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
face and then go to the UVA start moving

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.470 
face and then go to the UVA start moving
the<00:03:25.780> v's<00:03:25.959> around<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.939> previously<00:03:28.359> it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the v's around like like previously it's

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.960 
the v's around like like previously it's
going<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.659> start<00:03:29.220> taking<00:03:30.220> away<00:03:30.609> some<00:03:30.879> of<00:03:30.909> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
going to start taking away some of the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580 
going to start taking away some of the
UVs<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.359> this<00:03:31.480> side<00:03:31.659> or<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.230> hair<00:03:32.349> on<00:03:32.379> this

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
UVs on this side or the hair on this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.690 
UVs on this side or the hair on this
side<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.120> place<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:35.340> you're<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.519> there

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
side and place it you're not there

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.729 
side and place it you're not there
however<00:03:37.299> it's<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.720> go<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.200> another

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
however it's going to go to the another

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.280 
however it's going to go to the another
UV<00:03:39.129> or<00:03:39.370> another<00:03:39.670> face<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.299> shares<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.079> same

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
UV or another face that shares the same

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.770 
UV or another face that shares the same
space

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.199 

now<00:03:44.350> if<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.709> move<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.010> back<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.880> not<00:03:46.060> going

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
now if I move this back it is not going

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.730 
now if I move this back it is not going
to<00:03:46.300> replace<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.750> because<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.140> already<00:03:47.410> drawn

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
to replace it because it's already drawn

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.800 
to replace it because it's already drawn
on<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.670> set<00:03:48.940> on<00:03:49.120> his<00:03:49.330> face<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.350> if<00:03:50.530> i<00:03:50.650> go<00:03:50.680> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
on this set on his face so if i go and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.340 
on this set on his face so if i go and
completely<00:03:52.810> move<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:55.959> see<00:03:56.140> that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
completely move you can see that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.600 
completely move you can see that
everything<00:03:56.800> like<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.130> plane<00:03:57.370> is

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
everything like the plane is

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.020 
everything like the plane is
disappearing<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.270> if<00:03:58.360> i<00:03:58.450> move<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.720> back<00:03:59.670> it<00:04:00.670> is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
disappearing and if i move it back it is

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.970 
disappearing and if i move it back it is
not<00:04:01.180> replacing<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.910> like<00:04:04.209> before<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.739> won't

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
not replacing but like before it won't

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.520 
not replacing but like before it won't
replace<00:04:06.250> because<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:06.730> there<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.170> state<00:04:08.410> is

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
replace because of there like a state is

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.110 
replace because of there like a state is
previously<00:04:09.060> 01<00:04:10.060> space<00:04:10.330> not<00:04:11.170> 3d<00:04:11.530> space

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
previously 01 space not 3d space

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.690
