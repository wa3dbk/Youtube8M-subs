 beige shadow that can be matte or 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 shining that is going to be paired 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 the tones of our eyelid the second 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 step is the outline we have different 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 colors that we will choose according to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 we want and finally we have the mask 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 of tabs that will give the touch 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 special to this makeup we turn to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 see how it's done let's start with 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 a malisse expression makeup that is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.300
 very fast to make us every day 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.539
 with a flat brush and wide hair and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.850
 a very clear shadow beige we are going to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.720
 load 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.680
 the brush and we will apply it in all 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.190
 let's stick it in our whole eye 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.890
 from the lash line to the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.440
 eyebrow line and we're going to 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.020
 Make up here this line that goes 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.450
 from the end of the nose and goes through the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.570
 end of eye is called up line 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.790
 reference that line is what is going to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.800
 give the limit that from here to here 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.980
 Make up here for here not because it gives the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:35.210
 feeling that our eye falls on 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.920
 second step is with the eyeliner that in 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.990
 this case I will show you eyeliner 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.570
 brown to make a good makeup 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.330
 natural 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.330
 let's apply between the tabs 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.880
 small stretches 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.590
 well from the end of the eye and the second 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.360
 step of the outline that I already told you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.780
 in the delineated video 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.460
 with brown shadow and the brush we are going to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.460
 fix the eyeliner 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.410
 without fear of loading 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.599
 and finally we are going to apply the mask 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.940
 of eyelashes that are also taught in 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.910
 the video over mask application 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.950
 of tabs how it is applied 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.950
 remember well from the root 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.110
 looking down do not forget these 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:41.940
 last lashes with the clean brush 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.940
 of lashes we comb them 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.050
 for this makeup there is one more trick 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.600
 which may be optional if we want to give it 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.580
 a little bit of color to makeup and that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.910
 not so natural what we can 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.770
 do is apply with the same 15 lithium 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.220
 that we apply the beige shadow some 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.569
 light color can be a rose a golden 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 or an orange we are going to apply 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.370
 a doradito in the central part 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.470
 Of the eye 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 let's go loading 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.980
 and after applying the center we're going to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.980
 go to the sides 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.770
 I hope that today's tips have 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.770
