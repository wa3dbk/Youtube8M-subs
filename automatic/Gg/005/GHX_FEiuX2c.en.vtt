00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.399
 I welcome you to the sixth scenario video here on the 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.260
 youtube channel StarCraft 2 0 20 marriage 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.309
 and this time we'll talk about the contamination scenario 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.659
 you see, it's about a base with a few base units 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:16.519
 interest 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.839
 consisting of drama and protoss units 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.169
 and the key to this gold rating is actually just in the 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.220
 take over enemy units 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 namely tanks and templars and iPod 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.109
 well we start 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.490
 you see, shame and such have been provided 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.900
 the flap is best done with the r button 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.990
 Incidentally, with the r key you can also dig up the well on the 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.750
 Units is they can also be invited to move that is you 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.180
 Just grab those 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 Plattling out for a tank and take over 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.310
 I can change the Deuce to the short distance because of the planning mode 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.180
 do not attack 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.430
 But keep in mind that the case must be dug up so that the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.270
 can take over enemy units 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140
 But let's not look at all what the tanks are doing 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.570
 but in which should also be one or the other fan of such and cockroaches 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 move on because you are under time pressure 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.900
 and therefore has to fight on several fronts, so to speak 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.990
 For example, here again a template is taken over here 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.579
 the pure Ziesch tower thunders in a group of profit participation pagans 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 and now you can start writing the unit quite simply 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010
 it should be said 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.960
 the takeover of individual Olins or ailing and down there is not worth it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 really amount should take place 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.799
 The bulging little things in vain will easily take over with the damage 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.830
 but it goes on well with those for such 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.960
 everyone nice to see a distraction with contaminated 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.630
 Terrans 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.900
 so you do not unnecessarily lose your four such when he comes from Graz 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 For example, iPod has something else to do there 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.260
 Of course there is also position where to build such 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.940
 can position without the children attacking above 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.220
 but I like him the contaminated Scharner anyway and donate in addition 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.539
 hold some confusion 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.229
 By the way, could also put the stamp on press 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.689
 and chase oneself storm rows 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.759
 and then it should continue with the case 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.409
 in the place as you see 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.900
 it is quite useful again to create a diversionary maneuver around the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 Tanks and the iPod at the same time 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.469
 this may require some practice but you do not have any 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.389
 Problems that you Dr iPod the tank makes broken or the tank possibly 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.309
 the old town 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:43.459
 if she only takes one of them 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.739
 and that would be all self-runners so now if the two 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.249
 Units has taken over 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.779
 we'll do the rest and you can sit back and do that 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.819
 Wait for gold currency 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.339
 small tip on the edge 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.229
 if you still miss Kilz 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.229
 It is also easy to attack and destroy captured units 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.359
 and like him 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.719
 Almost two minutes left and already gold 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.149
 but look briefly at what they could still do in still around 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:16.459
 a few extra Kilz trains 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 so that the whole thing is a bit safer overall 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.159
 With the damage you can still take care of individual buildings 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 yes that still a spirit in between, but that's it 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.649
 so here you just have aliens click Blum Poland building in 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.709
 because buildings count as a defeated unit 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.839
 and do not worry about inherited units 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.839
 the parasitic connection lasts indefinitely 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.599
 otherwise it could be a bit with the tank from the top right at the very 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.949
 Start playing around 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.159
 because you can simply stop the dollar-course mode 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.779
 with Dr 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.469
 because then drive around a bit 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.360
 and to the metier again the field loading Smooth activate the here to see 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.549
 Of course, an alternative route could have been long uphill 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.419
 However, the scenario is so simple that you take with few 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.069
 Key units that loosely create gold mining and therefore 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
 I renounce now on this alternative routes in the video 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.990
 so the war again with the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.210
 in my opinion easy to master scenario here 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.550
 I hope you liked it and you could again tip one or the other 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.559
 dust off 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:39.189
 and we'll hear again in the next video about singer Rio's photo of death 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.539
 also soon
