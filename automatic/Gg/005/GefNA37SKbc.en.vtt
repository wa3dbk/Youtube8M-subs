 sure they will like it very well and 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 what is the first step monica the first 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.819
 step to make the rice is to wash it 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 with hot water communicates that it already has 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.350
 very cleverly 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.390
 to dance or rice the oil is already 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.040
 well hot true yes sure

 and there is everything 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 and here we are going to fry it for how long 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.459
 more or less as we know that it is already 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.560
 ready in 10 minutes has to be 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.400
 ready we are going to drain it so that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.740

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.560
