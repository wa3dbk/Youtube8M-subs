right<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.349> at<00:00:10.620> MWC<00:00:11.219> 2015<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.090> what<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> see

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
right here at MWC 2015 and what you see

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.609 
right here at MWC 2015 and what you see
right<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.400> prototype<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:15.619> Kyocera

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
right here is the prototype from Kyocera

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.670 
right here is the prototype from Kyocera
that<00:00:17.039> has<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.789> solar<00:00:18.420> charging<00:00:18.960> display

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that has the solar charging display

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
that has the solar charging display
integrated<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.850> saw<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.600> lit<00:00:21.840> up

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
integrated and as you just saw it lit up

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
integrated and as you just saw it lit up
when<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> turned<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> further<00:00:23.160> bit<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.760> little

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
when I turned it a further bit a little

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420 
when I turned it a further bit a little
bit<00:00:24.150> further<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.600> when<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.680> current<00:00:26.070> gets

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
bit further up when the current gets

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.750 
bit further up when the current gets
high<00:00:26.699> enough<00:00:26.810> -<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.109> -<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.250> app<00:00:29.490> to

high enough - so - or the app to
actually<00:00:30.150> recognize<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> device<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
actually recognize that the device is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
actually recognize that the device is
charging<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.640> basically<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.420> very

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
charging it's basically just a very

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the power input and it will let you know

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.010 
the power input and it will let you know
when<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> panel<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.210> gathered<00:00:42.780> enough

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
when the panel has gathered enough

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
when the panel has gathered enough
energy<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:44.000> charge<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> phone<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
energy to actually charge the phone it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
energy to actually charge the phone it's
got<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> four<00:00:46.200> inch<00:00:46.350> screen<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
got a four inch screen right here it's a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
got a four inch screen right here it's a
very<00:00:47.640> basic<00:00:47.820> phone<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.480> case<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.899> also

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
very basic phone in this case it's also

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.639 
very basic phone in this case it's also
trimmed<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> rugged<00:00:50.579> device<00:00:50.940> because

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
trimmed has a rugged device because

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.529 
trimmed has a rugged device because
Kyocera<00:00:52.649> has<00:00:52.860> always<00:00:53.100> been<00:00:53.489> doing<00:00:54.090> these

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
Kyocera has always been doing these

super rugged smartphones in this case I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.910 
super rugged smartphones in this case I
don't<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.379> specs<00:00:58.649> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
don't know much about the specs just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.580 
don't know much about the specs just
that<00:00:59.520> it's

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
that it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.290 
that it's

these are see-through solar cells and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.770 
these are see-through solar cells and
then<00:01:16.340> as<00:01:16.550> far<00:01:16.820> as<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:17.060> can<00:01:17.119> tell<00:01:17.390> there's<00:01:17.570> not

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
then as far as I can tell there's not

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.940 
then as far as I can tell there's not
much<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.410> any<00:01:18.979> problems<00:01:19.910> in<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.140> viewing<00:01:21.440> part

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
much of any problems in the viewing part

of<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.400> device<00:01:22.759> I<00:01:23.000> see<00:01:23.390> as<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.200> can<00:01:24.350> tell

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
of this device I see as you can tell

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.670 
of this device I see as you can tell
it's<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.130> bit<00:01:25.310> washed<00:01:25.490> out<00:01:25.700> that's<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.119> bit<00:01:26.680> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
it's a bit washed out that's a bit the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's a bit washed out that's a bit the
colors<00:01:27.979> aren't<00:01:28.220> very<00:01:28.490> full<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.030> viewing

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
colors aren't very full and the viewing

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.240 
colors aren't very full and the viewing
angles<00:01:29.690> are<00:01:29.780> also<00:01:30.020> suffering<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.770> little<00:01:30.920> bit

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
angles are also suffering a little bit

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.330 
angles are also suffering a little bit
but<00:01:32.180> overall<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:33.020> device<00:01:33.289> seems<00:01:33.560> very<00:01:33.890> useful

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
but overall the device seems very useful

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.790 
but overall the device seems very useful
very<00:01:34.520> usable<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.330> if<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:35.630> outside<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
very usable and if you're outside and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.499 
very usable and if you're outside and
you<00:01:36.860> want<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.250> use<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.610> project<00:01:37.880> unction<00:01:38.420> you

might want to live with those smaller

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.779 
might want to live with those smaller
disadvantages<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:41.690> just<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.530> go<00:01:42.729> show<00:01:43.729> you

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
disadvantages it's just to go show you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.389 
disadvantages it's just to go show you
that<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.690> definitely<00:01:45.050> working<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.979> to

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
that this is definitely working and to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.710 
that this is definitely working and to
demonstrate<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.000> I'm<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:47.360> going<00:01:47.539> to<00:01:47.600> hold

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
demonstrate that I'm just going to hold

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.190 
demonstrate that I'm just going to hold
my<00:01:47.899> hand<00:01:48.140> over<00:01:48.470> here<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.179> then<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:50.570> should<00:01:50.840> at

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
my hand over here and then it should at

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.260 
my hand over here and then it should at
some<00:01:51.440> point<00:01:51.649> stop<00:01:52.130> charging<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.820> as<00:01:52.970> soon<00:01:53.149> as

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
some point stop charging and as soon as

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.240 
some point stop charging and as soon as
you<00:01:53.420> remove<00:01:53.539> your<00:01:53.810> hand<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.619> will<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:54.950> start
