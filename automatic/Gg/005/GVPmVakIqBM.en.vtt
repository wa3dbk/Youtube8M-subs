these<00:02:03.570> shoes<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.110> dope<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.490> this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
these shoes are pretty dope I think this

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.130 
these shoes are pretty dope I think this
is<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> raptor<00:02:06.509> cut<00:02:06.689> away<00:02:06.840> but

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
is kind of like a raptor cut away but

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.130 
is kind of like a raptor cut away but
you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.910> close<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.899> guess

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can see if you look up close I guess

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
a hit of purple on the back with that

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
pull tab and that black and grey little

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.920 
pull tab and that black and grey little
box<00:02:41.290> area<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> with<00:02:42.219> the<00:02:42.250> red<00:02:42.519> 23<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.089 

that's<00:02:46.930> pretty<00:02:47.049> much<00:02:47.139> it<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.590> other<00:02:47.769> thing<00:02:47.950> is

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
that's pretty much it the other thing is

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.270 
that's pretty much it the other thing is
then<00:02:49.090> makes<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.659> pair<00:02:49.959> I'm<00:02:50.169> fairly<00:02:50.859> unique

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
then makes this pair I'm fairly unique

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.179 
then makes this pair I'm fairly unique
is<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.169> you<00:02:53.169> can<00:02:53.319> see<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.769> bottom<00:02:54.099> is

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
is that you can see that the bottom is

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.949 
is that you can see that the bottom is
just<00:02:54.459> black<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.389> so<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.689> a<00:02:55.750> black

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
just black and this so it's a black

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.520 
just black and this so it's a black
bottom<00:02:56.290> pair<00:02:56.560> um<00:02:57.459> not<00:02:58.419> I<00:02:58.719> don't<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:59.379> if

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
bottom pair um not I don't know if

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.289 
bottom pair um not I don't know if
anybody<00:02:59.859> even<00:02:59.919> has<00:03:00.189> these<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.519> don't<00:03:00.700> know<00:03:00.819> it's

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
anybody even has these I don't know it's

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.789 
anybody even has these I don't know it's
not<00:03:01.719> even<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.989> big<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.230> deal<00:03:02.349> but<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.680> was

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
not even that big of a deal but it was

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.770 
not even that big of a deal but it was
just<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.549> something<00:03:03.909> different<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.750> I

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
just kind of something different that I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.059 
just kind of something different that I
thought<00:03:04.930> was<00:03:05.049> kind<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.319> cool<00:03:05.469> so<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.769> was<00:03:05.859> like

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
thought was kind of cool so it was like

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.479 
thought was kind of cool so it was like
not<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> finished<00:03:06.879> pair<00:03:07.709> sample<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.250> like

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
not a finished pair sample it's like

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.520 
not a finished pair sample it's like
more<00:03:09.760> for<00:03:09.969> the<00:03:10.060> upper<00:03:10.359> I<00:03:10.540> guess<00:03:10.810> not<00:03:11.139> for<00:03:11.439> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
more for the upper I guess not for the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.709 
more for the upper I guess not for the
bottom<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:12.040> don't<00:03:12.519> know<00:03:12.609> how<00:03:12.760> they<00:03:12.790> necessarily

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
bottom I don't know how they necessarily

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.899 
bottom I don't know how they necessarily
produce<00:03:14.079> them<00:03:14.439> but<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:14.919> the<00:03:15.189> the<00:03:15.219> upper<00:03:15.669> looks

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
produce them but but the the upper looks

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.879 
produce them but but the the upper looks
completed<00:03:16.389> but<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.989> bottom<00:03:17.349> is<00:03:17.469> definitely

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
completed but the bottom is definitely

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.289 
completed but the bottom is definitely
all<00:03:18.010> black<00:03:18.220> but<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.430> actually<00:03:18.549> really<00:03:18.940> dig<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
all black but I actually really dig the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.390 
all black but I actually really dig the
all-black<00:03:19.599> look<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.079> these<00:03:20.229> for<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.099> bottom

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
all-black look on these for the bottom

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.270 
all-black look on these for the bottom
of<00:03:22.120> these<00:03:22.329> samples<00:03:23.169> so<00:03:23.379> just<00:03:23.889> figured<00:03:24.190> I'd

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
of these samples so just figured I'd
