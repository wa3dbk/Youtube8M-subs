don't want to go too overboard because

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.260 
don't want to go too overboard because
it<00:00:19.289> stays<00:00:19.890> light<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.430> much<00:00:20.580> longer<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.090> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it stays light so much longer and it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.210 
it stays light so much longer and it's
still<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.810> warm<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.560> don't<00:00:22.890> want<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
still so warm so you don't want to have

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.160 
still so warm so you don't want to have
any<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.609> really<00:00:23.910> super<00:00:24.390> super<00:00:24.960> dark

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
any like really super super dark

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.259 
any like really super super dark
dramatic<00:00:25.350> makeup<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> thought<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
dramatic makeup so I thought this is a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.720 
dramatic makeup so I thought this is a
good<00:00:27.510> compromise<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.949> am<00:00:29.130> bringing<00:00:29.369> back

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
good compromise and I am bringing back

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.389 
good compromise and I am bringing back

haven't<00:00:32.940> used<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> tutorial<00:00:34.410> since<00:00:35.340> my

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
haven't used this in a tutorial since my

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
haven't used this in a tutorial since my
smoked<00:00:36.329> series<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> linked

fun<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> bring<00:00:41.850> back<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> look<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.840> own

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fun to bring back with a look of my own
