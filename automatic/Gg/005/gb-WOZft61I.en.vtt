00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
called i guess at home casual but

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.419 
called i guess at home casual but
whatever<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> my<00:00:10.920> favorites

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
whatever it is it's one of my favorites

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.370 
whatever it is it's one of my favorites
and<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.670> thought<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.660> good<00:00:13.170> day

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and I thought that I would be a good day

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.620 
and I thought that I would be a good day
to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.460> no<00:00:14.790> mirror<00:00:15.059> makeup<00:00:15.210> challenge

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to do the no mirror makeup challenge

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.990 
to do the no mirror makeup challenge
because<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:17.130> anywhere<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.789> by

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
because I'm not going anywhere so by

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390 
because I'm not going anywhere so by
really<00:00:18.510> really<00:00:18.779> stuff<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.500> won't<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.189> as

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
really really stuff it up it won't be as

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.970 
really really stuff it up it won't be as
big<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.060> deal<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.769> was

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
big of a deal as if it was if I was

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500 
big of a deal as if it was if I was
going<00:00:23.279> somewhere<00:00:23.310> afterwards<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
going somewhere afterwards I think I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.670 
going somewhere afterwards I think I
would<00:00:24.630> probably<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.380> fix<00:00:25.500> my

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
would probably have to really fix my

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
would probably have to really fix my
makeup<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> don't<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
makeup because I don't have a lot of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.000 
makeup because I don't have a lot of
faith<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.810> ability<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> apply<00:00:28.650> makeup

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
faith in my ability to apply makeup

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
faith in my ability to apply makeup
without<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.369> mirror<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.910> sometimes<00:00:30.720> even

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
without a mirror because sometimes even

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.749 
without a mirror because sometimes even
when<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> mirror<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.009> steal<00:00:32.340> stuff<00:00:32.550> up

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
when I have a mirror I steal stuff up

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.889 
when I have a mirror I steal stuff up
but<00:00:33.030> anyway<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> thought<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> would<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> fun

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but anyway I thought it would be a fun

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.979 
but anyway I thought it would be a fun

good start I have this weird shiny bit

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.240 
good start I have this weird shiny bit
here<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:04.080> don't<00:06:04.500> know<00:06:04.710> what<00:06:04.979> quite

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
here and I don't know what quite

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.719 
here and I don't know what quite
happened<00:06:05.610> over<00:06:06.210> here<00:06:06.419> but<00:06:07.280> considering<00:06:08.280> i<00:06:08.550> did

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
happened over here but considering i did

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.379 
happened over here but considering i did
that<00:06:09.349> with<00:06:10.349> no<00:06:10.650> mirror<00:06:11.340> at<00:06:11.520> all<00:06:11.729> i<00:06:12.030> think<00:06:12.060> it

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
that with no mirror at all i think it

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.510 
that with no mirror at all i think it
could<00:06:12.509> have<00:06:12.599> been<00:06:12.720> a<00:06:12.780> lot<00:06:13.099> occasion<00:06:14.099> of<00:06:14.220> you<00:06:14.340> so
