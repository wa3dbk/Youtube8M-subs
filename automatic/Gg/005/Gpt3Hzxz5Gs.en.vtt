00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
using it and I really didn't honestly

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.710 
using it and I really didn't honestly
know<00:04:37.639> about<00:04:37.909> three<00:04:38.030> or<00:04:38.150> three<00:04:38.270> parts<00:04:38.510> until

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
know about three or three parts until

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.089 
know about three or three parts until
Melissa<00:04:38.990> contacted<00:04:39.560> me<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.740> honestly<00:04:40.039> tell

Melissa contacted me to honestly tell
you<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.400> truth<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.570> had<00:04:41.870> no<00:04:42.020> idea<00:04:42.139> that's

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
you the truth so I had no idea that's

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.810 
you the truth so I had no idea that's
why<00:04:42.680> she's<00:04:42.919> bringing<00:04:43.190> up<00:04:43.250> stuff<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.520> didn't

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
why she's bringing up stuff I didn't

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.360 
why she's bringing up stuff I didn't
actually<00:04:43.970> meet<00:04:44.300> proper<00:04:45.110> patio<00:04:45.409> stuff<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.340> I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
actually meet proper patio stuff so I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.250 
actually meet proper patio stuff so I
didn't<00:04:46.639> really<00:04:46.789> care<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.030> guess<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:47.510> look<00:04:48.080> at

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
didn't really care I guess but look at

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.839 
didn't really care I guess but look at
the<00:04:48.409> difference<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.039> is<00:04:49.070> night<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.520> day
