I've used this pack quite a bit this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
I've used this pack quite a bit this
winter<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> spring<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.480> I've<00:00:39.690> used<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
winter and spring and I've used it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
winter and spring and I've used it
exclusively<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.040> trail<00:00:41.309> running<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
exclusively for trail running and it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
exclusively for trail running and it's
been<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.870> nice<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.620> those<00:00:43.800> longer

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
been very nice to have on those longer

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
been very nice to have on those longer
runs<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:45.420> thing<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.200> liked<00:00:46.410> about

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
runs one thing that I really liked about

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
runs one thing that I really liked about
it<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.910> quickly<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it was that you can very quickly and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
it was that you can very quickly and
easily<00:00:48.690> adjust<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.350> hip<00:00:49.559> belt<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.950> found<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
easily adjust this hip belt I found that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
easily adjust this hip belt I found that
I<00:00:50.700> couldn't<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.210> find<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.719> position<00:00:52.050> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I couldn't really find one position that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
I couldn't really find one position that
I<00:00:52.410> liked<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> duration<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> run<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
I liked for the duration of the run and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.760 
I liked for the duration of the run and
I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> nature

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I think that's just kind of the nature

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
I think that's just kind of the nature
of<00:00:55.980> running<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> lumbar<00:00:57.149> pack<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of running with the lumbar pack but the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
of running with the lumbar pack but the
good<00:00:58.230> news<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.890> quickly<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
good news is that you can quickly and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
good news is that you can quickly and
easily<00:00:59.640> adjust<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.289> running

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
easily adjust it and when you're running

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
easily adjust it and when you're running
it<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.920> tends<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.340> stay<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.640> place<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.270> very

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it it tends to stay in place very very

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
it it tends to stay in place very very
well<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> pockets<00:01:05.369> were<00:01:05.489> definitely<00:01:05.909> big

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
well the pockets were definitely big

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.750

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
there's a smaller one which will hold

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
there's a smaller one which will hold
your<00:01:09.990> keys<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.010> bar<00:01:11.220> maybe<00:01:11.580> some<00:01:11.880> gel<00:01:12.330> packs
