00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.399
 and 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.399
 do not 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.730
 ah 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 hello everyone I'm the jute and welcome to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 the myth hunter episode 5 and as the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.680
 game is grand theft new car 55 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.060
 myths episode 5 everything fits together so 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.739
 we start 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 and in myth number one we have to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.690
 certain that tells us what happens if the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.699
 c4 we stick it on a jet wheel 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.590
 private or luxor as you want to call it 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.629
 well, here I am with my mÃ¡nquez 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.760
 usual because it can not be left to the 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.160
 wheel but at last I got it and like 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.890
 you see there it seems that the c4 well that 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.519
 go through that wheel, we do not see it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.260
 but as you see there the c-4 goes through that 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.239
 wheel and absolutely nothing like that happens 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.850
 who provides it again at the wheel 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.629
 front and as you know the luxor then 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.760
 when flying, we can hide those 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.380
 wheels and I do not know what will happen with that 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.510
 four ago if they have stuck that that is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.030
 the myth that is asking us 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.790
 true not so let's go study 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.659
 tearing up and look at the boxes where 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.540
 they have stayed have stayed in the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.580
 soil so it's a myth hunted I do not know 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 they stick to the wheels 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.060
 and scope number 2 we have a billion 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.790
 which says that if in the campaign you can 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.310
 catch the crane and that turn that crane 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.470
 take another car so I got the crane 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.690
 and I have another car there I go to where 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.360
 I have the charge I go black there all 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.340
 cool, no, it 's there, we're with maikel 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.720
 and let's take the charge I could see if 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.430
 we can take two cars at the same time 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.710
 truth is that I would be a weight 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.830
 considerable for the position but good 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.420
 maybe it may happen that when you pick it up 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.610
 simply take the curve and the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 another is normally taken off so 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.290
 let's try it that's the myth to see if 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.050
 you can catch both cars at the same time 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.790
 taking only the crane so here we go 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.010
 the truth is that I am very bad with the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.070
 good charge I'm bad with everything really 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.869
 but well nothing happens here we are with 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 the charge is trying trying and 30 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.040
 military I do not get it I do not get it 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.630
 there is I caught it and we go up to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.420
 up the truth that it weighs quite a lot 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.070
 very difficult to control the charge with 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 two cars the truth but good as 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.180
 see there the crane also lifts the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.580
 car down and there because he gave her a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.580
 hit then fell but not really 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.130
 yes confirmed you can catch 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.410
 and the car and myth number 3 we have to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.030
 smoke is it says that if we jump in 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 a ramp and we save the game in the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.320
 air and then we load it we are in the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.900
 air or on the ground for the truth that I 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.240
 it seemed quite interesting I've had 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.700
 so like that and I take the virtual ramp 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.640
 and it's from the airport I say it's there 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.800
 the day saved fast about writing 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.290
 any game and good is already 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.480
 saved is supposed so we fall and 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.760
 now simply because we have left 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.610
 give us the start and load that game that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.100
 we just obviously keep that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.640
 departure is March 14 is not the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 February 14 so here I see it 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.050
 As you can see I have the game a hundred 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.700
 hundred and we charge and as you already know that the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.820
 Charge time in this gta 5 is 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.300
 insufferable and sometimes it's even frustrating 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.090
 Well, super fast and ready camera 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.250
 so there he charged and looks when 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.320
 we appear we appear in the air I do not 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.380
 I imagined that this would happen so 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.560
 this myth is confirmed very much we appear 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.170
 in the air incredible the truth 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.760
 and the number 4 we have a master goes pro 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 that says if we shoot someone 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.090
 with the hat is what has been 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.349
 a hat in the online dies or is the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.480
 goya top hat we know a hat 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.370
 high but it does not occupy our entire head 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.610
 so it would be very false if 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.580
 we shoot up as you see there does not die 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.069
 good women if the car so what 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.200
 run over to evil not but in what 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.750
 is coming the hat does not die or is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.190
 there is a limit that is what would be the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.380
 head as you see 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.569
 This is the limit and as you can see above 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.280
 Well, I would not die if we shot so 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.930
 very good on the part of pink and sanction 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.700
 that because if it would not be very easy it 's in 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.290
 the head and in myth number 5 we have 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.079
 aces and marko that tells us that if we can 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.190
 stick a c4 on the cargo hook the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.290
 It really is but I found 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.120
 quite interesting pretty troll 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.830
 because we can work our friend or 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.290
 taking his car there with a c4 in the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.780
 hook as well as 20 g have a height 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.669
 high so that the hook hangs up and 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.290
 we can paste perfectly it becomes 4 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.600
 between the road and the building there 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.729
 michael tried to commit suicide I have it 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.020
 exploited making the myths but good 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.120
 nothing happens 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.729
 there we see the hook and hanging with 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.069
 our c4 and they actually stick those 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.930
 c4 so we can troll there's free 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.930
 it is confirmed very scenic 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.479
 and up to here the event 5 of the hunter of 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:55.580
 Myths in 7 to 5 I hope that I have 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.830
 liked that there was to the height and 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.169
 good you have in the description the channel 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.050
 from the creator who sealed the sweets for 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.089
 happen to see more videos about the gta 5 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.550

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:09.620
 pass if you like or subscribe 6 so 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.930
 I said that I hope you liked a 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.469
 like a favorite would help a lot and 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.469
 until next time
