00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.490
 proceed to install the processor and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 cooler 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.670
 first i want to say this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.860
 processors here a lot depends 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.660
 specifically from your computer here 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.400
 your processor yes that is, you can 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 the processor would be to say into it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.519
 bought up to 2 picking 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.609
 Ie either he you have show simply one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.660
 processor without anything yes it's a bundle 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.180
 y and m or either he went here in such 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 beautiful box 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 which is also attached cooler of course 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 if you bought a boxed version yes how 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.930
 It is called that is in the box version 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 with a cooler then in this version 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 the processor can be said to be completely ready 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.620
 to install and use 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.910
 that is, besides the cooler coming to them 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.760
 still covered by special 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.970
 thermopaste ie this substance is well 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.180
 yes applied to the processor it serves to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.570
 better heat transfer 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.630
 heat transfer between the processor and the cooler 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.030
 its core yes it flows much 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 better that is much more efficient cooler 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 cools the process so what am i 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.340
 saying that if you bought processes in 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.770
 boxed versions date on it probably 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 it has applied thermal grease that is, 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 you do not need to ask this question 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.369
 in general, well, you actually see it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.320
 another thing if you bought the process 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.399
 out of the box is always that is to eat 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.850
 equipment then such processors 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.549
 it is necessary to cover those dangerous 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.219
 that is, you need either when you 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.590
 acquire color give it can go 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.390
 on thermal grease included either 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 acquire it separately the point is that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.569
 Thermal grease comes here such 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.810
 and tubes 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:21.139
 does that mean you just shoot yes that's it 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.760
 cover and squeeze out of the cube 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.760
 thermal paste on the processor 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.569
 Again, I repeat that thermal grease to you 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.200
 must either be purchased separately or 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.299
 if you bought a duck cooler to your oem 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
 the processor is in it 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.310
 shipments already 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.939
 you can have such a tube of thermal grease 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.709
 does this mean applying thermal paste 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:50.930
 apply it must be on 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.629
 process, I recommend you apply it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.639
 after installation in this case I have 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.769
 since the processors were previously 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.669
 already installed in the computer so on 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.689
 It's traces of thermal paste to the left and 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:07.810
 Means as for the very application 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.430
 you need to apply thermal grease to the center 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.659
 then when are we going to install the cooler yes 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.229
 it will squeeze tight processors and 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:22.040
 thermal grease spread over the surface 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:25.840
 exactly but by no means apply 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.530
 the entire contents of the tube is enough 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.159
 a small amount 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.959
 about the size of the court this cap for 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.680
 this tube so much thermal paste 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.629
 will be more than enough for 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.720
 effective cooling because if 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.509
 you put it too much then 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.000
 CPU surface will be thick 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.769
 layer and it will reverse the way 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.859
 cooling is too thick 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.209
 it is bad but also the complete absence 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.719
 thermal paste is just as bad i mean you 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.639
 need a very thin layer of thermal paste on 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:03.500
 processor surface so here's what i 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.780
 wanted to say before starting the installation 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.560
 now let's start the installation 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.560
 processor
