00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
distant replay guess it's the brand or

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
distant replay guess it's the brand or
whatever<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.259> yeah<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.979> hoods<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> look

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
whatever but yeah some hoods and look

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.140 
whatever but yeah some hoods and look
too<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> hate<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:35.250> yeah<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
too big and I hate that but yeah so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.280 
too big and I hate that but yeah so
we'll<00:01:36.299> try<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.689> later

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
we'll try that on later

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.160 
we'll try that on later
but<00:01:38.950> most<00:01:39.310> likely<00:01:39.870> everything<00:01:40.870> will<00:01:40.990> fit

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
but most likely everything will fit

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.730 
but most likely everything will fit
correctly<00:01:41.790> I'll<00:01:42.790> post<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.150> video<00:01:43.590> saying<00:01:44.590> it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
doesn't then it doesn't this box it has

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.920 
doesn't then it doesn't this box it has
like<00:01:50.530> two<00:01:50.740> things<00:01:51.010> in<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.250> all<00:01:51.430> right<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:54.930> mean
