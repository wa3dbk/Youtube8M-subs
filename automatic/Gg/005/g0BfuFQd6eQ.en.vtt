are from the pc that are on the xbox one
okay<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.549> could<00:03:29.549> use<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.820> same<00:03:30.060> logic<00:03:30.540> like

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
okay I could use the same logic like

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.530 
okay I could use the same logic like
saying<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.769> anybody<00:03:32.130> who<00:03:32.310> uses<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.640> pc<00:03:32.970> control

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
saying to anybody who uses a pc control

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.240 
saying to anybody who uses a pc control
now<00:03:33.989> tac<00:03:34.410> controller<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.920> makes<00:03:35.100> no<00:03:35.190> sense

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
now tac controller that makes no sense

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.670 
now tac controller that makes no sense
anyone<00:03:36.180> who<00:03:36.239> uses<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.540> 360<00:03:37.260> controller<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.040> pc

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
anyone who uses a 360 controller on a pc

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.580 
anyone who uses a 360 controller on a pc
well<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.860> controller<00:03:41.280> came<00:03:41.549> from<00:03:41.700> consoles

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
well that controller came from consoles

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.050 
well that controller came from consoles
so<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:43.920> you're<00:03:44.070> using<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.519> then<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.820> means

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
so if you're using that then that means

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.479 
so if you're using that then that means
consoles<00:03:45.540> are<00:03:45.630> better<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:46.140> I'm<00:03:47.130> not<00:03:47.310> going

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
consoles are better right I'm not going

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.130 
consoles are better right I'm not going
to<00:03:47.549> use<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.700> dumbass<00:03:48.150> logic<00:03:48.690> because<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.079> know

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
to use that dumbass logic because I know

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.979 
to use that dumbass logic because I know
that<00:03:49.470> while<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.920> bit<00:03:50.070> faulty<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.870> got

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.930 
that while just a bit faulty but you got
to<00:03:52.049> admit<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.860> life<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.190> also<00:03:53.400> faulty

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
to admit that that life is also faulty

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.970 
to admit that that life is also faulty
when<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.239> compare<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.079> mods<00:03:55.320> being<00:03:55.620> trenched
