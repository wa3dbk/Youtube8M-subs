it's going to make the boot more water
resistant<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.300> will<00:00:44.390> not<00:00:44.510> make<00:00:44.750> it

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
resistant but it will not make it

resistant but it will not make it
waterproof<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.680> one<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.850> things<00:00:47.090> we<00:00:47.269> sell
