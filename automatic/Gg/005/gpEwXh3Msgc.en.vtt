00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.050
 I am german and i travel with mine 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.800
 Traveling piano through the world and 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.800
 piano concert under the open sky 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.120
 Having momentum means going for me 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 no one else else to go 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.570
 gone and did not listen to what 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 everyone says but you have the courage 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 to really implement your own ideas 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 even if everyone says it works 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.880
 Not 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.099
 we have with my father 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 this production planned and a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 taken normal piano and that just 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.020
 put on experienced platform with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 really stable wheels 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.860
 there are moments everything is just right 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.500
 there is quiet on an area environment 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.540
 and 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.830
 the people always keep the cellphone music 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.650
 The piano sounds great at the moment 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.820
 and I feel that and the people 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.760
 Arrives, and yes, if at the latest 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.230
 Goosebumps are produced by me then as well 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.230
 the people listening to the goose bumps 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 like 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.710
 I have someone we put and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 express my feelings if it suits me 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.020
 bad and I like to play 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.020
 be a school 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 I was on one with the piano now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.290
 europe tour last year in switzerland 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.980
 in france south germany in italy 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.270
 in austria and this year it should be 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.870
 nor Scandinavia may still go 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870
 Eastern Europe 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.180
 the special thing is that the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.450
 people expect everything else except 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.040
 piano music under the open sky and you 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.190
 then get out of the steffl you 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.620
 maybe they are straight and if they are then 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.180
 to hear and tell me after that they 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.740
 totally enjoyed this moment 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.740
 that's really great
