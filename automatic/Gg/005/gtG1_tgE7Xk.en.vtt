00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.619

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.500
 alarmed and has brought them much 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.560
 as an option because of what is happening and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.620
 how it happened good as of Tuesday 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.230

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.900
 morning time of finding two 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.840
 corpses in the tapir sector 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.559
 community san francisco police 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.870
 national and to this new town we 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.270
 we present the place we find 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.260
 indeed the finding of two 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.869
 corpses two adults 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.950
 and we started the previous investigations 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.810
 from that moment 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.850
 and we also knew that it 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.610
 I had kidnapped 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.729
 to one of the daughters of the lady who 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.040
 had been killed dawn the day 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.720
 Wednesday with all the elements since 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.670
 we already had the information that we 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.049
 they had given from the community 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.210
 we set out to make a 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.000
 operative in coordination with the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.580
 army forces in the community 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.240
 known as the horcones 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 the horcones and there we did the arrest 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 of three people we currently have 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.360
 stopped three people already if we're 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 Of course, only one 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.980
 person of the fact the other people 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 are still being stopped as we are going to 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 review the situation for effect 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.870
 let them go free but if we paste already 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.040
 with the true author 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.130
 the true actor of the fact already in the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.290
 work already carried out in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.020
 the interrogations the man we 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.690
 He already confessed to that ten thirty of the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.810
 night after two days of work with 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.750
 the one who had effectively murdered him 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.709
 these three people were left 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.280
 buried at approximately 35 meters 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.730
 the house where the act had been committed 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.220
 that had ended up there with a shovel and that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.880
 had buried the bodies near a 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.030
 pipe where a river passes 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.410
 and I also propose that if the girl 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.360
 he had murdered and he had buried her 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.640
 in the same place where we with the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.990
 community we had found the day 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.990
 previous the cell 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.740
 josé andrés stolen effectively yes 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.230
 has a background 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.370
 for murder he was involved in 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.560
 a murder case 189 years ago that 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.709
 you live here in a new town where 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.209
 Aunt of the case was the victim 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.280
 Paul and is he called you then 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.170
 he participated this is nephew of life 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.810
 policy and participated in this case was 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.610
 arrested for that case has a history 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.550
 for theft intimidation 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.010
 antecedents for theft and injuries yes is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.840
 a potential if a good criminal 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 we move in conjunction with 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.350
 the police to do the reconnaissance 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 truth of corpse was made the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.780
 uprising we move to the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.450
 where it was this the semi 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.670
 buried moved to this place 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890
 we proceeded to review and in the findings 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.260
 they found this good there 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.090
 post- mortar changes that more or less 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.510
 coincide with what is the window of the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.450
 death we are talking about this this 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.400
 it was approximately according to what it refers 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.340
 on Monday we are talking 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.069
 today this four have already passed 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.290
 days and the changes that it presents more 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.049
 or less match even though they also 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.790
 the body is quite preserved and 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.220
 given the place and climate that is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.180
 pretty cool the place where I was 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.810
 also this semi-buried is cool 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.970
 that helped preserve the corpse what 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.460
 we move and review what 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.940
 we find is that it presents a wound 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 by sharps gun at the level of what 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.229
 it is in the anterior thorax left side to 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.510
 level of the third and fourth space 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.830
 intercostal which it penetrates through the 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.560
 heart area and this lung 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.180
 and also presented a concussion a 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.280
 blunt blow at the level of what is the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.160
 left jaw edge as only 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.850
 injuries then we can determine with 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.970
 that the cause of death is this 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.160
 a penetrating knife wound to 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.990
 thorax and this one that pierces lung heart 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:09.020
 thus causing also a single-engine me 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.000
 this fact that this cardiogenic is not 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.800
 made the review this is taken then 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.530
 the respective samples that with that 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.390
 because it will complement to to 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.150
 completely discard that there is 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.800
 been but is physically 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.569
 macroscopically there is not this evidence 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.669
 well of that 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.490
 the name of the girl according to the data that 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:34.039
 we provided this is called back 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.039
 emerges and alvarado lario of 9 years old 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.780
 but first when the couple 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.780
 first she appeared dead as she found out 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.810
 and we look for the whole sector 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.500
 and the whole death penalty if possible 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.540
 that unfortunate is not fair they were 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.430
 four people who died for a 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.140
 unfortunate that he is worth everything as if 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.110
 was nothing so we killed him what 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.810
 lynch all together I wish I existed 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.130
 that possibility of being able to kill someone 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.840
 to do that thing you think that taste 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.770
 we do not know if the girl is already raped 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.770
 they are many things 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.900
 not that man I did not know him first 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.250
 Once I 'm seeing it they say it says 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.530
 people that in girls come by the 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.060
 another girl who has just joined 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.610
 the girl because she did not live here 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.050
 had come on the first of June and they say 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.670
 that he was looking for them because my 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.660
 dad who did not have friends with anyone 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:48.140
 we can already recognize immensely the 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.270
 great effort that the media has made 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.610
 communication from the first day the 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.820

 news of bringing the information and the 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.340
 work that has been developing 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.160
 I want to congratulate all of you
