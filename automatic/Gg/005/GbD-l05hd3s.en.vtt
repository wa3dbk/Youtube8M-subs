00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.750 

I'm<00:02:42.860> guessing<00:02:44.500> wanted<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.560> go<00:02:45.650> by<00:02:45.890> size<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
I'm guessing wanted to go by size I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
and a half dual zero gauge power and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.960 
and a half dual zero gauge power and
ground<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:59.350> roughly<00:03:00.350> maybe<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.850> six<00:03:01.850> or

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970

eight gauge speaker output all the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.440 
eight gauge speaker output all the
controls<00:03:12.530> back<00:03:12.800> here<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:15.640> also<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> set<00:03:17.330> of

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.860 
controls back here I also have a set of
fifteen<00:03:17.870> inch<00:03:19.090> dual<00:03:20.090> 2-ohm<00:03:20.830> TFS<00:03:22.750> Igor<00:03:23.750> is

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
fifteen inch dual 2-ohm TFS Igor is

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.920 
fifteen inch dual 2-ohm TFS Igor is
coming<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.440> way<00:03:25.630> should<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.660> here<00:03:26.900> shortly

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
coming on the way should be here shortly

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.000 
coming on the way should be here shortly
I<00:03:27.320> hope<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.410> keep<00:03:30.410> an<00:03:30.530> eye<00:03:30.620> out<00:03:30.740> for<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
I hope so keep an eye out for the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.850 
I hope so keep an eye out for the
