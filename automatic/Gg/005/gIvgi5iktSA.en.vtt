 offense while putting helena goes 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.799
 talk a little about people because 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.299
 these ingredients are good for fat 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.590
 because the band let it come to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.960

 and so, but they help to reduce the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.329
 absorption does not eliminate the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.220
 situation because fat is good in our 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.840
