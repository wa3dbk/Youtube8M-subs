car you can see two pieces of glass and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.569 
car you can see two pieces of glass and
what<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.080> go<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.590> glass<00:00:32.160> store

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
what I do is I go to the glass store

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.209 
what I do is I go to the glass store
here<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.540> Vancouver<00:00:34.140> area<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.800> basically

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
here in Vancouver area that basically

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and I basically clean it up with I will

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
and I basically clean it up with I will
later<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.660> remove<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.550> whatever's<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
later on remove the whatever's on the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
later on remove the whatever's on the
glass<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.020> window<00:00:49.350> cleaning

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
glass with one of my window cleaning

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670 
glass with one of my window cleaning
tools<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> scraper<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.260> removes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
tools it's a scraper and this removes

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.740 
tools it's a scraper and this removes
almost<00:00:52.920> anything<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> glass<00:00:54.360> right

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
almost anything out of the glass right

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.880 
almost anything out of the glass right
and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:56.570> wanted<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> basically<00:00:57.870> use<00:00:58.530> glass

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and I wanted to basically use glass

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
and I wanted to basically use glass
because<00:00:59.370> glass<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.850> higher<00:01:00.149> quality

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because glass is a higher quality

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
because glass is a higher quality
material<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:02.059> lasts<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> decade

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
material it basically lasts for a decade

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
material it basically lasts for a decade
or<00:01:04.019> two<00:01:04.199> instead<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> year<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
or two instead of just a year or two and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.140 
or two instead of just a year or two and
it<00:01:06.990> lets<00:01:07.260> more<00:01:07.470> light<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.000> into<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it lets more light in into the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.210 
it lets more light in into the
greenhouse<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.040> higher

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
greenhouse and it's just a higher

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.270 
greenhouse and it's just a higher
quality<00:01:11.790> material<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> roof<00:01:13.950> rack

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
quality material and I have a roof rack

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
quality material and I have a roof rack
and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.119> put<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:15.600> three

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and I just basically put two or three

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
and I just basically put two or three
pieces<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> basically

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
pieces on top of it and and I basically

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.820 
pieces on top of it and and I basically
haul<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.799> back<00:01:19.830> home<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> clean<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
haul it back home and clean it up and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.429 
haul it back home and clean it up and
cut<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> size<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.390> design<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
cut it to size if I have to design it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
cut it to size if I have to design it's
already<00:01:25.680> nice<00:01:25.950> size<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:27.600> wanted<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
already nice size and I wanted to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.679 
already nice size and I wanted to
basically<00:01:28.350> show<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.240> how<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> basically

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
basically show you how I basically

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.490 
basically show you how I basically
collect<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
collect it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
collect it
I<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.840> basically<00:01:37.020> Bungie<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.310> roof

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I just basically Bungie it on my roof

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:49.130 
I just basically Bungie it on my roof
rack<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:42.049> rope<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:47.329> this<00:01:48.329> stuff<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
rack and rope it and this stuff here

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.690 
rack and rope it and this stuff here
this<00:01:50.070> blue<00:01:51.000> stuff<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.079> side

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
this blue stuff actually on this side

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.999 
this blue stuff actually on this side
that's<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.000> basically<00:01:54.990> taped<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.590> stuff

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that's just basically taped on stuff

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
that's just basically taped on stuff
that<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.399> come<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.790> easy<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.390> tried<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
that will come off easy I tried it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.160 
that will come off easy I tried it
already<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.070> no<00:01:59.189> big<00:01:59.369> deal<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
already and it's no big deal and this is

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
already and it's no big deal and this is
a<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.130> nice<00:02:02.430> chunk<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> glass<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.600> will

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
a you know nice chunk of glass it will

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
a you know nice chunk of glass it will
basically<00:02:03.960> last<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
basically last and just have to be a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.850 
basically last and just have to be a
little<00:02:06.360> careful<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> doesn't<00:02:07.380> crack<00:02:07.649> when

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
little careful so it doesn't crack when

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.960 
little careful so it doesn't crack when
you're<00:02:07.979> transporting<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
you're transporting at the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.570 
you're transporting at the
to<00:02:10.180> visit<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:11.800> basically<00:02:12.130> gonna<00:02:12.340> use

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to visit and I'm basically gonna use

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.630 
to visit and I'm basically gonna use
that<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.030> my<00:02:13.120> greenhouse<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.490> is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
that for my greenhouse and this is

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.090 
that for my greenhouse and this is
recycled<00:02:16.180> stuff<00:02:16.390> instead<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.750> going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.410> some

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
recycled stuff instead of going to some

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.030 
recycled stuff instead of going to some
dump<00:02:18.880> or<00:02:19.150> some<00:02:19.870> recycling<00:02:20.380> depot<00:02:20.560> where

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
dump or some recycling depot where
