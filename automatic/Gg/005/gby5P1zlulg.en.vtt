00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.619

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.340
 palette if so with its colors 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.770
 so here and there the bc team that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 looked pretty much like that so that's it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.559
 I pity you you put yourself heading with its 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.239

 you'll like it soon 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.140
 so I already started doing my 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 complexion is born eyebrows us for the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 sources and you asked me for a tutorial 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 so that will come I'll leave you with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 the link so that's it if you want to see 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 how do I go my eyebrows a tutorial 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.900
 be there soon 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.690
 so we start by applying a lighthouse 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.970
 dark 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.260
 or well known to the achievement of co 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 120 I use my shining brunch and 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.450
 I'm applying this time an outer corner is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 also one in the hollow of the eye 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.480
 so it's just for 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.390
 report a few more structures to 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.550
 the eye and dimension actually to the eye 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.720
 other than that I will not apply on the other hand 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.720
 on the plus and you mix well 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.770
 then for a light touch and for 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.200
 a clean up or make-up uses a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.930
 lighthouse at home sephora with man 2 more 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.860
 close to home technics I place 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.909
 below the eyebrow and in fact that makes me 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.250
 allows to bring a touch of light 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.950
 candy and clean so that is to say 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.430
 that I erase but gesture we can it is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.510
 party where I have a little overwhelmed are in 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.510
 internal crawl 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.440
 but here it is a bit my 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:28.160
 camouflage technique 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:30.200
 when I miss his make-up I do 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.940
 even from the other side so sent as 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 it brings a touch the mayor but at the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.700
 time like that to football the parties where 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.700
 I have a little deported 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 so here I already made my feature 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.900
 eyeliner as you asked me a 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 tutorial it's a tutorial that will come next 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.340
 somewhere here and we continue the make 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.379
 up with its indispensable element it's 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.590
 the pencil the me I have a blue client of 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.680
 in whom cause and maté tabucchi if I 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 say it correctly and celine at 06 so 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 that I applied it as an internal muse 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.879
 lower and I try to pass it 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.209
 several times to actually intensify 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.209
 but the color 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.739
 but well that's what it gives 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.410
 I really like this electric blue side 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.040
 and it allows to wake up a little this 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.590
 very basic job at the base so 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.540
 I apply or Russian cmx mascara the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.519
 hair loss that co game of gold 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 really a lot and makes a brush 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.019
 huge as you can see 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.790
 and that's so it allows me to get involved 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.920
 in this setting a bit quickly like 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.750
 often I have not much time ben 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.750
 easy mascara a lot the task 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.230
 and as in the video I wore 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.599
 fossils we will stay true to the look 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.329
 so I'm replicating filing style with a 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.659
 glue of fossils of checchi kokari 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:05.370
 this favorite dish I apply the glue to 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:08.489
 close to the cl no I apply a good 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.069
 little layer I let dry a few 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.519
 moments for that consistency a little 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.519
 sticky 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.840
 and I start to apply it so I 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.050
 place the eyelash first in the center of the eye 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.760
 or watch as it sticks directly 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.160
 then I join the ports takes everything 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.750
 simply 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.150
 so take your time well that we do 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.560
 sauce and of course it's not obligatory 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.840
 to reproduce what you see very 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.550
 although it works without but as in 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.750
 life support fossils here 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.670
 I remain faithful 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.750
 you see a little what that also gives 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.750
 with fossils 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.930
 so that's what it gives I apply 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.670
 still some mascara to make 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.670
 melt the e6 together 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.059
 we pass our advice their highlighter 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.949
 clearing hours I do not know 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.239
 how do you say it's new from home 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.819
 kiko I'm trying 

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:14.269
 up to 100% convinced for now 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:16.399
 but it's the only one I have the reference 

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:22.360
 to three years by the info so I apply 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:24.919
 sun on the nose a little on the forehead 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.229
 on the greedy terminals I do not know how 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:32.119
 say think and about the world Thursday 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:35.319
 jumping but so here 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.319
 I try sounds with 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.830
 as said desproges top top of the senses 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:46.050
 where his father very smile but she 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:59.699
 depends 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:59.699
 and here is so gisèle and combines with that 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.670
 I then apply my fixed studio powder 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.400
 from max amap their favorite and 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.820
 I use my clock which also faces the 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.520
 warned 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.410
 it's a bit my shock team and 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.480
 I apply this powder everywhere 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.490
 to unify everything to mix 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.510
 all together and to have a complexion 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.510
 well uniform 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:38.530
 I still use an itouch explains for 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:43.270
 can bring a little glow yet 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:51.919
 as much as I click on the bone of the cheek 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:54.460
 a bit on the nose on the born and clip 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.460
 on the chin 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.330
 for english i use one from ebp 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.880
 and cosmetics by cons on the box there 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.410
 there is no longer the reference of the lighthouse but 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.180
 it's a pretty red brick , so 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.600
 you are never on the site search 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.700
 rather a bluff with this full hue 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.340
 I do not apply with my kabuki brush 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:20.400
 at sephora and I go back over 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:22.290
 with my pin body in red to 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.360
 lips using my brother came to you 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.630
 favorite of all times is rugby 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.370
 from at mac 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.710
 so that's a nice lipstick from the 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.160
 war crimes china and I really love 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.070
 a lot 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.000
 texture and simplicity 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.000
 Application 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:45.739
 that's what it gives me 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:48.349
 managed to reproduce exactly the same 

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:51.829
 make up so that I wore in life 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:54.799
 of the beauty curriculum and I really like 

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:57.259
 this result and it's really a beautiful 

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:59.360
 touch of color that's a little bit of creating 

00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:02.059
 what it gives hopefully that you 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:09.349
 please and that that pretty much answers this 

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:11.149
 that you wait and that's it I'm done 

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:13.569

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:13.569
