This is a review on Super Soaker CPS 2500

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.320
The little brother of the famous CPS 2000

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.960
This water gun had a mass production on the 90's

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.440
It is very popular on eBay

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.840
And it is much less expensive than the CPS 2000

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.120
It very similar to the CPS 2000

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.274
length of 90cm

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.840
with reservoir of 3.1 liter

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.340
It's pressure chamber reduced from 900ml to 650ml

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000
less powerful than the CPS 2000

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and less dangerous

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.700
kids can play with it, although it is still danger to shot from short range

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.400
Shooting range of 12 meters

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.760
and output 650ml in a second

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.640
powerful water gun. cheap. common.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640
You won't find it in stores

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.660
production line stopped on 1998

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.480
But it had a mass production, so you can still get one on eBay

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.980
As I said before - it's shooting range is up to 12 meters

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.420
Lets try to shot it up to the 2nd floor or the roof
