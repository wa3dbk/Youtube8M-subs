thing<00:00:58.730> with<00:00:58.879> one<00:00:59.059> foot<00:00:59.330> because<00:00:59.629> it's<00:01:00.110> not

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
thing with one foot because it's not

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.299 
thing with one foot because it's not
really<00:01:00.590> going<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.800> work<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.129> double

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
really going to work with the double

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.759 
really going to work with the double
pedal<00:01:01.550> because<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:01.850> have<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.150> keep<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:02.769> left

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
pedal because you have to keep you left

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.910 
pedal because you have to keep you left
for<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:05.570> nice<00:01:05.840> crisp<00:01:06.170> sound<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.740> hi-hat

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
for that nice crisp sound on the hi-hat

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.790 
for that nice crisp sound on the hi-hat
so<00:01:07.430> i'll<00:01:08.330> place<00:01:08.600> really<00:01:08.930> slow<00:01:09.170> for<00:01:09.410> you<00:01:09.440> the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
so i'll place really slow for you the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.790 
so i'll place really slow for you the
pattern<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.670> space<00:01:11.420> right<00:01:12.020> left<00:01:12.259> base<00:01:12.530> base

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
pattern is space right left base base

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.219 
pattern is space right left base base
left<00:01:13.190> right<00:01:13.430> base<00:01:13.700> base<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:14.300> left<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
left right base base right left and so

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:31.390 
left right base base right left and so
on<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:21.070> but<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:22.399> in<00:01:23.149> triplets<00:01:23.899> so<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:24.920> like

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.070 

I<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> move<00:01:33.120> it<00:01:33.180> around<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.570> kicks<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
again what you can also do with this is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.450 
again what you can also do with this is
you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.400> continue<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.840> pattern<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:20.160> long<00:02:20.370> as

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
you can continue the pattern as long as

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.420 
you can continue the pattern as long as
you<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.260> snare<00:02:22.260> drum<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.710> beat<00:02:22.920> two<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you have the snare drum on beat two and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.070 
you have the snare drum on beat two and
four<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.030> still<00:02:24.360> feel<00:02:24.690> where<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
four you can still feel where the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.600 
four you can still feel where the
Wetherby<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.070> right<00:02:29.280> hand

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.140 
Wetherby is so you have the right hand
on<00:02:30.030> beat<00:02:30.810> two<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.010> left<00:02:32.250> hand<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.700> before
