thing<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.860> don't<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.580> official<00:01:40.420> Sega

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
thing I don't like is the official Sega

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.249 
thing I don't like is the official Sega
controller<00:01:41.380> has<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> nice<00:01:42.819> much<00:01:43.630> bigger<00:01:43.899> grip

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
controller has a nice much bigger grip

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.809 
controller has a nice much bigger grip
on<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.640> mean<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:48.069> end<00:01:48.250> point<00:01:48.520> where<00:01:48.729> it

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
on it so I mean the end point where it

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.609 
on it so I mean the end point where it
connects<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> same<00:01:49.720> but<00:01:49.959> there's<00:01:50.349> just

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
connects is the same but there's just

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.260 
connects is the same but there's just
that<00:01:50.740> much<00:01:50.920> extra<00:01:51.280> room<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.580> grip<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.090> get

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
that much extra room to grip it and get

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.990 
that much extra room to grip it and get
it<00:01:52.300> plugged<00:01:52.479> into<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.840> system<00:01:53.459> as<00:01:54.459> far<00:01:54.729> as<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it plugged into the system as far as the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.650 
it plugged into the system as far as the
quality<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.690> buttons<00:01:56.110> goes<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.509> say

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
quality of the buttons goes I got to say

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.080 
quality of the buttons goes I got to say
hands<00:01:58.929> down<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.470> Sega<00:01:59.830> one<00:02:00.099> is<00:02:00.340> way<00:02:00.910> better

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
hands down the Sega one is way better

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.330 
hands down the Sega one is way better
this<00:02:01.390> thing<00:02:01.599> feels<00:02:01.869> heavier<00:02:02.349> it's<00:02:02.740> made<00:02:03.099> of<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
this thing feels heavier it's made of a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.510 
this thing feels heavier it's made of a
much<00:02:03.729> stronger<00:02:04.060> plastic<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.979> just<00:02:06.160> works<00:02:06.399> a

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
much stronger plastic it just works a

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.279 
much stronger plastic it just works a
lot<00:02:06.610> better<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.970> is<00:02:07.060> my<00:02:07.149> favorite<00:02:07.720> Genesis

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
lot better this is my favorite Genesis

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
obviously made cheaper it works just the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.140 
obviously made cheaper it works just the
same<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.790> part's<00:02:19.090> nice<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.849> little

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
same so that part's nice it's a little

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.770 
same so that part's nice it's a little
bit<00:02:22.300> smaller<00:02:22.720> than<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.349> official<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:24.780> one

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
bit smaller than the official one one

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.900 
bit smaller than the official one one
problem<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.410> did<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.920> was<00:02:27.310> whenever<00:02:27.730> I'm

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
problem I did see was whenever I'm

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.130 
problem I did see was whenever I'm
playing<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.240> game<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.690> go<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.840> slide<00:02:29.110> over
