00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.540
 Big brother has gone 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 a book in this room 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.340
 Do you still remember 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 Once this person 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.980
 Big brother really has a heart 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.620
 Keep the handwriting of Jun She 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.420
 As a souvenir 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.040
 this is 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.060
 Suddenly shocked 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 All the way to the inexplicable rush 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 In an instant 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.620
 Chamber 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 Big brother 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.220
 Shocked this eye 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.400
 moment 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.140
 Understood everything 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.160
 Early that morning 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.320
 Big brother's eyes floating red 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 There is injury on the finger 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.560
 I asked why my brother 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.580
 He shook his head silently 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 Said that the word is ok 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 That smile 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 I saw the sadness 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.680
 brothers 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.860
 This life 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.280
 Itâ€™s a fool, you are right. 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.580
 Can't take revenge for you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.400
 This blood 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.660
 Let you go under the yellow spring 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
 Remember to condemn me 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 That night 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.900
 Big brother in the independent pavilion 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.120
 Looking at the piano 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.140
 For a long time 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.200
 I asked why 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.820
 Big brother said 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.820
 Piano and piano 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.300
 Waiting 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.740
 Not just him alone 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.880
 I understand 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.640
 Big brother is heartbroken again. 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.760
 today 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.720
 Big brother finally agreed 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.020
 Let me join the project 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.120
 He wants me to never 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.240
 Leaking to brother 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.300
 I asked Big Brother 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.260
 Such a road 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.500
 Not alone? 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.320
 He says 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.280
 I am not a stone 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.060
 Also shaken the will 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.780
 But if I give up indifference 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 Then the world comes 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.300
 I may be safe 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020
 Are you sinking with the people? 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.380
 Once I take responsibility 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 I will see the future 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.100
 The future of sadness and hope 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.720
 original 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.160
 This is the secret of Big Brother. 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.720
 Infatuation 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.540
 Infatuation 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.240
 After the green frost station left 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.360
 The day of the year 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.260
 Big Brother will not go out for a trip 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.840
 When you come back 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.460
 Body 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.820
 There is another flower and earthy taste 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.920
 Big brother does not say 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.340
 I will not ask 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.940
 later 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.500
 I understand 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.460
 Autumn rain wave 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.060
 Infatuation 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.220
 Infatuated 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.140
 original 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 You are still the original you 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.140
 Dead leaves 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.940
 The bridge has been broken 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 If I didn't find it 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.640
 Big brother, you 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.960
 Whether even secret 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 Also bring to the grave 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.380
 original 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.140
 This is your silent mind. 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.440
 original 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.760
 This is your lonely road 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.940
 that 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.580
 And me 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.640
 Sound original 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.480
 The original that cannot be recovered 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.020
 As the ground is speechless 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.100
 Hidden heart 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.140
 If no one knows 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.820
 Quiet 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.480
 Wither
