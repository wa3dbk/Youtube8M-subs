old fuse or you get caught cheap you saw
the<00:00:54.570> iron<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:56.370> heat<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.870> iron<00:00:58.460> in<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.699> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the iron to heat up the iron in there so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:17.899 
the iron to heat up the iron in there so
the<00:01:01.140> fuse<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.920> remove<00:01:02.219> easier

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
measure the land up the and then cut it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
measure the land up the and then cut it
so<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.180> too<00:01:24.420> long<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> saw<00:01:26.720> mister

black mm right there and then install it
back<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.020> rum<00:01:48.290> unit<00:01:49.000> do<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.180> have<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.900> can

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
back to the rum unit do we have you can

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.469 
back to the rum unit do we have you can
use<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.530> -<00:01:51.830> run<00:01:52.130> phone<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.970> printer<00:01:53.300> will

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
use the - run phone the printer will

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.480 
use the - run phone the printer will
reset<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:54.110> zero<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:55.009> do<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
reset to zero and then you can do that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.680 
reset to zero and then you can do that
room<00:01:55.759> for<00:01:56.090> another<00:01:56.420> circle<00:01:57.170> or<00:01:57.380> two
