00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:13.930 

my<00:00:05.879> piece<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.420> three<00:00:06.660> words<00:00:06.960> would<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.680> power

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.140 

unity<00:00:17.570> I'm<00:00:18.570> thinking<00:00:18.990> about<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:20.430> women<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
unity I'm thinking about the women that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
unity I'm thinking about the women that
I'm<00:00:21.300> working<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.850> drawing<00:00:25.460> power<00:00:26.460> out

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
I'm working with and drawing power out

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.830 
I'm working with and drawing power out
of<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> power<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> if

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of them the power that they have and if

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
of them the power that they have and if
it's<00:00:31.050> almost<00:00:31.279> learning<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> new<00:00:32.489> technique<00:00:32.730> for

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it's almost learning a new technique for

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
it's almost learning a new technique for
all<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.590> not

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
all of them because it's really not

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970 
all of them because it's really not
about<00:00:35.690> what<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.829> about

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
about what you look like but it's about

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
about what you look like but it's about
what<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.730> how<00:00:38.910> effective<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.660> space

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
what we do with how effective this space

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
what we do with how effective this space
around<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.649> there's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> resistance<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
around you there's a resistance in the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.060 
around you there's a resistance in the
movement<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:43.379> getting<00:00:43.500> power

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
movement because they're getting power

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
movement because they're getting power
from<00:00:44.489> resistance<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> their<00:00:45.690> bodies<00:00:48.530> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
from resistance in their bodies that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
from resistance in their bodies that
relates<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> music<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> I'm

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
relates a lot of the music that I'm

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
relates a lot of the music that I'm
using<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:52.230> using<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.860> couple<00:00:53.100> different<00:00:53.219> punk

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
using I'm using a couple different punk

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770 
using I'm using a couple different punk
and<00:00:54.239> hardcore<00:00:54.390> bands

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.460 

there's<00:00:59.410> an<00:00:59.530> effort<00:00:59.800> quality<00:01:00.490> of<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:00.820> music

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
there's an effort quality of that music

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.930 
there's an effort quality of that music
that<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.770> see<00:01:04.530> delayed<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.860> two<00:01:06.010> forms<00:01:06.550> and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
that I see delayed the two forms and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.679 
that I see delayed the two forms and
there's<00:01:07.630> also<00:01:07.840> an<00:01:08.229> attitude<00:01:08.410> of<00:01:08.920> define

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
there's also an attitude of define

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.569 
there's also an attitude of define
which<00:01:10.079> I'm<00:01:10.259> interested<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.829> that<00:01:11.009> comes<00:01:11.340> out

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
which I'm interested in that comes out

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.419 
which I'm interested in that comes out
through<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.079> effort<00:01:13.499> and<00:01:13.679> not<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:14.039> like

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
through the effort and not only like

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.099 
through the effort and not only like
what<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:14.789> literally<00:01:15.240> saying<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:15.929> how

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
what you're literally saying but how

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:24.000 
what you're literally saying but how
you're<00:01:16.319> saying<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.640 

so<00:01:24.520> as<00:01:24.760> an<00:01:25.000> alumni<00:01:25.570> from<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.230> MFA<00:01:26.620> program

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
so as an alumni from the MFA program

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.490 
so as an alumni from the MFA program
here<00:01:27.400> at<00:01:27.670> Ohio<00:01:28.210> State<00:01:28.600> University<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
here at Ohio State University the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.160 
here at Ohio State University the
Department<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.040> Dance<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.650> use<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> lot<00:01:33.490> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
Department of Dance I do I use a lot of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.260 
Department of Dance I do I use a lot of
the<00:01:35.170> language<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.950> I've<00:01:36.130> learned<00:01:36.880> here

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the language that I've learned here

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.900 
the language that I've learned here
because<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:37.810> kind<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.230> unifying<00:01:38.740> tool<00:01:39.160> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
because it's kind of a unifying tool the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.540 
because it's kind of a unifying tool the
music's<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:44.110> really<00:01:44.770> classical

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
music's really really classical

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550 
music's really really classical
counterpoint<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.960> kind<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.230> how<00:01:47.350> I've

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
counterpoint this is kind of how I've

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.370 
counterpoint this is kind of how I've
always<00:01:47.680> moved<00:01:48.190> but<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.270> never<00:01:49.570> had<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:49.930> words

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
always moved but I never had the words

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.680 
always moved but I never had the words
to<00:01:50.830> describe<00:01:51.010> it<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:51.730> clearly<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.510> distinctly

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
to describe it so clearly and distinctly

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.260 
to describe it so clearly and distinctly
as<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.830> was<00:01:54.190> able<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.460> gain<00:01:54.700> during<00:01:55.120> my

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
as that as I was able to gain during my

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.780 
as that as I was able to gain during my
time<00:01:55.510> here
