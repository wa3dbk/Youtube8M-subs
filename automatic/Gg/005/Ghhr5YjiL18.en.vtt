options you can you could look in the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
options you can you could look in the
back<00:00:40.770> box<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> machine<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> get

back box of the machine if you can get
into<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.110> box<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
into the back box if you can get if you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.660 
into the back box if you can get if you
can't<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.360> box<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.899> there

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
can't get into the back box up there

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.700 
can't get into the back box up there
quite<00:00:47.670> often<00:00:47.940> there's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> key<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> key

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
quite often there's a key to the key

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
quite often there's a key to the key
show<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:53.059> up<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> key<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
show you up here there's a key to this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
show you up here there's a key to this
often<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.059> key<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.690> inside<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
often the key to this is inside the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
often the key to this is inside the
machine<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.789> can't<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.690> either

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
machine so if you can't get into either

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
machine so if you can't get into either
one<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.800> into<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.520> below

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
one you want to get into the one below

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
one you want to get into the one below
first<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> may<00:01:03.809> find<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.170> key<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
first because you may find a key to the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.270 
first because you may find a key to the
upper<00:01:05.040> part<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.619> case<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
upper part in there in this case we can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
upper part in there in this case we can
get<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> upper<00:01:09.060> part<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.689> there's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
get into the upper part because there's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.060 
get into the upper part because there's
a<00:01:09.960> security<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> actually

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
a security bit and we can actually

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
a security bit and we can actually
unscrew<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.180> easily<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.290> down

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
unscrew that one pretty easily but down

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.359 
unscrew that one pretty easily but down
here<00:01:14.869> there<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.080> no<00:01:16.290> easy<00:01:16.500> way<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:17.070> into

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
here there is no easy way to get into

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
here there is no easy way to get into
this<00:01:17.810> as<00:01:18.860> far<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.509> let<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.780> let<00:01:21.900> me

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.540 

first<00:01:36.410> thing<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.680> want<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.920> try<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.310> to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
first thing you want to try is just to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.890 
first thing you want to try is just to
see<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:37.940> really<00:01:38.180> locked<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.600> know<00:01:38.690> just

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
see if it's really locked you know just

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.450 
see if it's really locked you know just
take<00:01:39.050> up<00:01:39.230> take<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.500> regular<00:01:39.740> slotted

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
take up take a regular slotted

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.110 
take up take a regular slotted

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
screwdriver and see if you can turn it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.610 
screwdriver and see if you can turn it
sometimes<00:01:44.120> these<00:01:44.330> things<00:01:44.660> look<00:01:45.260> like<00:01:45.290> they're

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
sometimes these things look like they're

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.280 
sometimes these things look like they're
really<00:01:45.800> locked<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.550> they're<00:01:46.700> not

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
really locked in there but they're not

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.340 
really locked in there but they're not
no<00:01:48.290> luck<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.800> case<00:01:49.480> so<00:01:50.480> what<00:01:51.110> we're<00:01:51.260> going

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
no luck in this case so what we're going

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.720 
no luck in this case so what we're going
to<00:01:51.410> do<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.860> we're<00:01:51.980> going<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.160> drill<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:52.520> lock

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
to do is we're going to drill this lock

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.180 
to do is we're going to drill this lock
out<00:01:52.970> these<00:01:53.510> locks<00:01:53.810> only<00:01:54.230> cost<00:01:54.440> about<00:01:54.680> five

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
out these locks only cost about five

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.700 
out these locks only cost about five
bucks<00:01:55.550> or<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:55.970> they're<00:01:56.750> pretty<00:01:57.050> cheap<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.500> get

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
bucks or so they're pretty cheap to get

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.280

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.319 
and I've got like newspaper all down
here<00:03:45.260> below<00:03:45.519> because<00:03:46.519> I<00:03:46.549> read<00:03:46.819> own<00:03:47.000> a.m.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
here below because I read own a.m.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.750 
here below because I read own a.m.
because<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:48.470> thing<00:03:48.650> shoots<00:03:49.190> filings

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
because this thing shoots filings

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.599 
because this thing shoots filings
everywhere<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:51.590> course<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.489> my

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
everywhere and of course it's in my

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.069 
everywhere and of course it's in my
living<00:03:52.850> room<00:03:53.030> because<00:03:53.420> I've<00:03:53.510> run<00:03:53.630> out<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.810> room

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
living room because I've run out of room

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.539 
living room because I've run out of room
so<00:03:54.109> this<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.590> where<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:54.829> working<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.370> so

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
so this is where I'm working on it so

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.479 
so this is where I'm working on it so
let's<00:03:56.329> see<00:03:56.480> what<00:03:56.600> we<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:56.870> do

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.270 

stop<00:04:03.489> every<00:04:03.879> now<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.269> then<00:04:04.950> put<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> little<00:04:06.190> bit

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
stop every now and then put a little bit

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:25.250 
stop every now and then put a little bit
of<00:04:06.400> oil<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:06.790> there<00:04:19.680> with<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:22.900> easy

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.370 

so<00:04:27.660> sometimes<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.990> pick<00:04:29.139> out<00:04:29.320> a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
so sometimes you have to pick out a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.920 
so sometimes you have to pick out a
little<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.830> as<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.790> was<00:04:30.970> drilling<00:04:31.449> it<00:04:31.570> once<00:04:31.810> I
