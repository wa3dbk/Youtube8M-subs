00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.170
 hello everyone knows but street 83 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
 we find ourselves on call of duty kids 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.290
 in modec sanctions and today when 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.850
 of this video I will tell you about 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.440
 information from the second episode so 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.690
 the information that corresponds to 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.580
 the map help me so brief give some 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 information also tell you how 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.059
 he get and so that's it I hope that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
 this video will please you I hope that 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.680
 this one will also help you 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.150
 so that's the video on the most 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.250
 clear possible I decided to do 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.780
 like the video of the iphone ie 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.190
 to divide the information into three 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.360
 categories because we only get them 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 not all the same way 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.879
 so with regard to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.220
 first category information 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.540
 you have 2 the prologue and the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.879
 pilots so with regard to the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.229
 prologue you will get it from the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.420
 when you bought the dlc 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.130
 devastation so from the moment where 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.570
 you'll have there down can help me 1 and for 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.060
 view it you will have two 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.369
 possibilities either you will see this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.950
 intelligence by launching a part in 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.390
 solo but the advantage is that you 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.530
 can see it in full screen but 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 winning lacombe is that you will 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.770
 see it only once so the old 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 rolled over if ever after you 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 decided to redo a game in barrels 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.549
 you will not be able to visualize this 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.380
 information 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.939
 but the second possibility that offers itself 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.859
 to you and there you will be able to visualize 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.119
 as many times as you want it's in 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.429
 going into the menu with penalties that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.940
 in a long time info and then you will 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.590
 intelligence 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.990
 of this second episode simply 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.570
 regarding intelligence 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.460
 epilogue in this one will be held from 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.200
 from the moment you finish 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.850
 mission my ideas so as for the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 nightfall pilots years so it takes 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.540
 that you came to the end of the kraken a 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.670
 once you have to kill you will have a 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.770
 end kinematics that fits beautiful 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.720
 epilogue simply and you can 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.070
 visualize it again by going in 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.810
 the menu with sanction then going 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.880
 in the info as for all the others 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.350
 information so here too 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.980
 concerned information from the first 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.510
 category 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.760
 regarding the information of 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.770
 the second category these last so 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.300
 you have four of them 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.440
 random way by searching the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.880
 little boxes that lies a little 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.860
 everywhere in the different areas of the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
 map accept the last where there is the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.680
 Kraken does not have 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.960
 small search boxes as it is the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.580
 case for nightfall by the way when 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.650
 you fight the spawner you do not have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.720
 no little boxes to search it's 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.340
 just during the first three zones 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.280
 of the map and not in the four 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.140
 areas of the amap so simply by 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 against I do not know if it's me or if 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.370
 the note that wants that but I galere 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.030
 to find the information in the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.410
 small boxes 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.320
 I find that they are much more 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.459
 rare to find who are really 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.050
 much rarer to find than 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.940
 give it one night ce2 night falls is 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.739
 almost all of them from the first part 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.450
 after two games it was over 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.560
 that they all had no regard to 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 the same band and frankly I had to 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.890
 do at least ten parties 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.360
 before everyone and get and I have 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.100
 really galley so I do not know if 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.630
 it's luck that did not smile on me or 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.400
 it's really rare to find them 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.170
 but if you ever have a little bit of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.950
 bad to find them do not worry 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.019
 it's not a bug 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.760
 it just takes a little insisting and do 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.140
 a lot of parts and once that 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
 you will not have them again 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.470
 can view them again in 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.060
 going into the exception menu and then into 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.230
 going info so that's what 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.130
 information about the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.570
 second category 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.790
 and with regard to the information 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.250
 of the third category these last 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.720
 well as for nike times there is to 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.800
 specific places and not in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.570
 searching for small boots 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.920
 but here they are not 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.720
 computers but tablets 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.850
 so regarding so I'm going 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.260
 give you tell you where to get 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.840
 found different tablets one you 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.250
 have five so also relates to the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.140
 first tablet that will allow you to 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.970
 retrieve their spies teaching at 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.830
 sleep this one is in the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.300
 first part of the map in the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.220
 Romanian science to the spawn in the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.790
 first room simply and you 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.620
 will see the tablet cash 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.450
 immediately a pipe and to be able to 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 access you will have to be born from the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.329
 drill unlock a door that is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.040
 find at the top 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.840
 once you unlock the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.060
 door that will allow you to access a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.609
 very small room to a very small 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.680
 piece so you get out of this room in 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.540
 that both externally and so much the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.450
 window of bosch and you will see that you 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.120
 will be able to access the pipes and if ever 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.949
 you had to see you at the bottom of the one 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.570
 here the famous tablet that you 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.459
 will still recover a faith of 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.870
 sleep experience information in this 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.229
 which concerns the second tablet 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.090
 this one is in the room where you 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.410
 face where you have to push back 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.539
 attacks that kraken 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.880
 except that to access it you will have to 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.500
 destroy the nest of this room and you 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.419
 will also need to unlock the door 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.650
 using the drill so you can 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.500
 climb the stairs 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.699
 once you've done all this 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.919
 you go up the stairs and you go 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.289
 any time all right simply and 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.550
 you access a balcony on which 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.500
 find on the right 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.259
 the second tablet that will allow you 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.930
 to recover their teaching clip t on 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.159
 regards the third tablet 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.740
 which will allow you to recover their 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.360
 teaching sorcery this one is 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.280
 found in the second part of the map 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.440
 that was to say in the cargo area 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.599
 so you will see in the middle of dunes 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.800
 huge room a container but you do not 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.150
 can not really access it in 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.130
 climbing over it because it's you 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.419
 will first climb on others 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.610
 containers that will allow you to access 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.500
 to the other contain on which is 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.229
 the third tablet with respect 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.360
 intelligence mutiny so it takes 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.180
 that you find the fourth table is 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.979
 so this one is in the second 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.599
 part of the third zone of the amap 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.169
 so that is to say at the bridge enclosure 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.110
 superior 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.340
 you will see a small duct that surrounds 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.500
 of four gas pumps that you 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.240
 will eventually have to protect and behind 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.979
 this leads and is this famous 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.300
 fourth tablets and in what 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.919
 regards the last tablet that you 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.720
 will recover the information 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.880
 the guardian this one is at the 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.530
 last zone so in the fourth there 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.880
 where you have to fight kraken so 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.979
 once you are in this area 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.860
 to you go straight ahead and you will see 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.630
 in front of the ramp on a platform 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.340
 this famous fifth and last 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.449
 tablet so that's it with respect 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.740
 intelligence of the third 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.080
 category 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.220
 like for the iphone something that 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.660
 is important enough it's a small 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.190
 detail but that's pretty important 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.930
 anyway, whenever you go 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.639
 retrieve information about the 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.139
 second or third category 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.849
 you are going to get 500 bucks 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.690
 extra so if you ever have 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.340
 six thousand dollars 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.009
 if you are good then you can 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.449
 $ 8000 if you're ever awesome 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.789
 or there and that you have increased your 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.160
 skill your engineer class have 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.680
 wanted to have had $ 8000 but if ever 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.380
 you do not have this you can 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.000
 carry on you for up to $ 6000 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.680
 so if you're ever full and that 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.090
 good you can not know at the front 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.530
 smoke- free little boots if you have 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.970
 found such or such information but 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.710
 for tablets 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.449
 you will be able to know more 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.250
 if ever you are full peeping before 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.840
 take a tablet from before 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.940
