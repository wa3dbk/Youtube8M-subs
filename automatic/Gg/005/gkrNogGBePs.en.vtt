00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.540
 players review mario kart 8 paraguay 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.280
 challenging much more than gravity 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 from its beginnings to the present day 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.090
 Mario Kart is one of those few sagas that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.770
 they have kept us so close to control 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.300
 like the first day besides having 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.340
 destroyed a countless number of 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.810
 friends the eighth installment is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.939
 arriving with great force for the wii 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.710
 promising to revitalize both the formula 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.390
 of the game like the sales of a system 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.460
 that struggles to stay so current 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.200
 like this franchise fortunately there's no 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.730
 to worry about the changes that 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.890
 Formula of frenetic competition and 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.809
 fun are still preserved and even 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.250
 increases in several ways that 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.680
 innovation proposes this new delivery of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.150
 kart the answer is found in the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280
 antigravity mode incorporated to the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.990
 circuits when passing over a blue mark 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.610
 placed on the ground the tires of 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.870
 our vehicle will be transformed to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.580
 unfold a kind of panels 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.500
 antigravity that will let us drive from 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.660
 vertically by a wall and even 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.310
 totally on your head while we 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.810
 we maintain in this modality each shock 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.820
 that we make with the rivals we 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.739
 gives an additional mini turbo something that 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 It can not always be so beneficial 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.400
 because in narrow sections it becomes 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.500
 I easy to lose control and fall to 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.270
 empty this new element added to the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.009
 reincorporation of being able to immerse ourselves in 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.990
 the water or plan briefly has 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.670
 allowed the master to turn kiko no longer his 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 team create racing scenarios 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.750
 majestic and extremely creative 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 without much discussion the repertoire of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 new circuits presented is of the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.509
 best of the entire series is enough 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.430
 observe the skies in cloud of plus 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.140
 slide by mount guards or 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.909
 immerse ourselves in doping souls for 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 check also the vast majority of 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.450
 the retro tracks are excellent 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.159
 selections being some are so tower 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.369
 designed to add the new ones 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.369
 elements 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
 they probably noticed it at first sight 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 however, we could not stop 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.900
 confirm this is the game visually 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.760
 more spectacular than ever 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.500
 developed nintendo we not only say it 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.270
 for the incredible and striking range of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 colors used or dazzling 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 light effects but also by the most 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.150
 minimum detail that was added to the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.070
 animation of the characters in case 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.080
 little the company delights us with a 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
 amazing soundtrack recorded in 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.490
 live sessions with the famous and unique 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.110
 big band style for it in terms of 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.360
 technical aspects we do not hesitate in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.300
 place it even on the sensational 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 super mario world the addition of objects 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.750
 to the well-known repertoire of the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 Franchising is another aspect that increases 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
 the entertainment of each race the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.720
 boomerang is quite useful because 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.820
 We can use it three times and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 in which his return path is 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.570
 able to hit any rival that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 it crosses you in the same way what is the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.020
 horn that finally allows us 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 free ourselves directly from the lethal 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.709
 blue carapace the super 8 such as his 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.230
 name indicates it grants us 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.300
 simultaneously 8 objects to use them to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.400
 our whim but in reality 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.930
 our new favorite object is the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.670
 carnivorous plant that attacks the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.740
 enemies and the odd obstacle 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.569
 close in addition to boosting them a bit 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.220
 with each bite that you make from the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.989
 reintegration of the currency better neither 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.670
 speak since there are enough to 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.709
 throughout the environment as well as not 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.540
 It is very useful because it does not attack or defend 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.250
 it's a shame that the appearance balance 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.870
 between the power ops is still a bit 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.610
 annoyed because we had to witness 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 second players to those who 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.030
 they mysteriously granted them objects 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.470
 as powerful as the super 8 what 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.239
 rescatable is that for nothing we 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.650
 We face such unfair games or 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 arbitrary as the launch 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.580
 for wii rather the difference makes it 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.500
 no longer be able to carry two objects 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.060
 simultaneously a variant to which 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.920
 assured will cost them adapt to the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.319
 followers of each title but propicia 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.319
 much more intense confrontations 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.130
 this time we have a range of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.720
 30 characters at our disposal 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.520
 among those who find the already 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.620
 medium classics like mario and pitch 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.990
 heavy as rolling and donkey kong and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.820
 light as everything occupies troop likewise 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.550
 we enjoyed the debut of the unruly 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.530
 q for rose gold and baby pitch kits 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.870
 rosalina each with their respective 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.550
 Weight and disturbing characteristics 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.320
 personality the balance between 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.940
 available characters has been quite 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.830
 careful so now we will not be 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.540
 dams of the domain so marked with the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.150
 that some runners like the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.070
 of hong kong or metal mario such as in 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.870
 mario kart 7 the difference at the time of 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.620
 handle makes the customization of 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.060
 our vehicle 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.010
 we are still able to select 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.020
 a car rims and glider or 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.760
 parachute each one counting on 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.769
 own characteristics that change 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.570
 radically the feeling of driving and 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.190
 whether you prefer a car focused on 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.530
 the speed or an all - terrain vehicle 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.300
 with great traction there is a wide 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.280
 variety of parts to cover many 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.540
 needs to collect several coins 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.550
 it is still the only way to 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.930
 unlock the parts and just like before 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.000
 give a slight increase in 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.860
 speed in full competition other 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 edition were the four-wheelers which 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.529
 it's pretty good even if we had 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.269
 liked to see more 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.249
 cars or motorcycles but we 

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:43.319
 we will conform with the great motorcycles of 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.879
 giorgi or wheeler talking about the 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.379
 items we have to mention that the 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.479
 four races so players 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.909
 local are so frantic and exciting 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.009
 like those of the unforgettable Mario Kart 64 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.449
 as always and as it should be 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.159
 occasions where you end up cursing 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.139
 your friends or colleagues for winning you 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.059
 last moment or throw yourself towards a 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.189
 ravine but also many others where 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.169
 presumed of one of your victories is like this 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.299
 is the true essence of this genre 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.279
 one that so many other developers have 

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:10.399
 tried to match just that they never have 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.399
 accomplished 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.640
 the online function is another of the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.560
 points that have been notably 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.050
 improved and has support for up 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.520
 12 simultaneous players here we follow 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.440
 with the variants of competencies 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.900
 regional or exclusively 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.640
 against your registered friends whether you 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.410
 participate in races or battles 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.330
 as well as since its introduction in the 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.130
 version of 10 our victories and 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.960
 defeats are reflected before our 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.540
 opponents to thus determine our 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.280
 international ranking the biggest new 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.560
 advantage that the gamepad gives us 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.300
 online is to let us communicate by 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.160
 voice chat with our friends since 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.380
 nintendo remains with its restrictives 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.420
 policies do not allow communication 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.710
 in this way with strangers at least 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.510
 we are able to send messages 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.180
 choosing from a list of phrases 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.340
 previously selected by the great n 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.770
 Of course the look can be very important 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.780
 but so is the gameplay and more 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.910
 even if we talk about a racing title 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.010
 in this aspect we can not worry 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.660
 since the action develops to 60 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.370
 frames per second what gives us a 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.620
 feeling of fluidity of movements without 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.150
 even this speed is even preserved 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.680
 in the modality for two players of 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.870
 local way which shows that 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.460
 through a good development the console 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.560
 still has enough power 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.000
 as if to surprise us unfortunately 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.830
 this is not transmitted to the modality of 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.900
 four players in a single system already 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.639
 that it only supports 30 frames per 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.860
 second and with some visible changes 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.569
 in the graphic section a small one that 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.160
 we never find it in functionality 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.440
 to display the image directly 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.210
 in the gamepad this function literally 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.400
 reflects what unfolds in the 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.139
 TV eliminating the possibility of 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.060
 that in multiplayer the user with this 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.220
 command enjoy a complete vision 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.840
 another wasted opportunity we see 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.729
 in the way of unlocking vehicles 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.319
 or the additional parts since these 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.240
 They are still provided randomly 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.430
 when collecting a certain number of coins 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.080
 all these problems are small to 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.970
 comparison of the main setback 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.830
 that presents this eighth installment those that 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.720
 before they were intense and frantic 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.370
 battles have now been transformed into 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.630
 pretty boring competitions the 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.520
 dilemma is in changing the 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.990
 scenarios since the games no longer 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.729
 are carried out in closed sands of 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.440
 combat but in some clues that 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.690
 they are part of the usual races 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.580
 with everything and that 12 participants form 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.050
 part of these contests the truth is 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.639
 that do not grant the same emotion of 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.319
 previous scenarios although the mode in 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.319
 line if it can become chaos 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.370
 It is not easy to decide that Mario Karl is 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.050
 better than another since everyone has 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.640
 counted on their own strengths that 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.380
 they have made them the favorites of millions 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.870
 of very different players around 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.370
 of the world although that's what mario kart 8 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.560
 It has so many good characteristics 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.210
 that we could place it in a place 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.040
 of Honor of the Nintendo Series 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.540
 surprises and did it once again has 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.610
 created a game of cards 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.110
 we will enjoy to the maximum no matter if 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.880
 we play it alone to challenge the 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.440
 better online times within the time 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.660
 trail or in the company of our friends 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.370
 in a relaxing afternoon this experience 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.370
 in front of the steering wheel is unique 

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.160
 ah
