00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.500
 a thousand years 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.259
 this is the average time required for the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 formation of one centimeter of soil 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 so among the five resources 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.210
 essential for life on earth 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.519
 it is the only considered non-renewable 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 today we will know a little more about 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 the soil of the pampas region and know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 as a rural producer can improve his 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.460
 relationship with this component of the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.460
 environment 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.910
 the pampa and its biodiversity below 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.070
 of this rich vegetation there is an element that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.600
 plays a key role for the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 balance of this biome 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.640
 The ground has already stopped to think about the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.039
 importance the soil has on our lives 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 it is about him that animals and people 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 walk every day is it also that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 interacts directly with other resources 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.619
 natural resources such as water 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.869
 these monkeys were removed from a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.960
 area of ​​native field in its condition 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 natural they exemplify important 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 relationship between vegetation and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 soil through these structures is also 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.220
 perceive the results obtained 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.540
 by means of differentiated management as 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 explains this researcher from embrapa 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 so what we can observe is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 fairly easy to see these two 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.810
 beautiful is that everything that happens up 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.119
 soil handling right the result of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.159
 that we have on the ground of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.170
 increase in dry matter production of 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.600
 increase of diversity we have to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 soil down too we see that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 the mass of roots that we have in this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.079
 monolith is much larger than the mass of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.869
 roots that we have in this monolith 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.259
 nor the only difference between the two is 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.020
 the vegetation above here is not 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.899
 tighter in this more if we are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 simulating a closer grazing with 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.299
 less slack and not even who is pretending 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.300
 a grazing but with a greater slack as 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.600
 he suffered a plant deferral and 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.480
 they only communicate directly behind 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.790
 take care of these elements in a way 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.040
 appropriate integrated 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.710
 achievement of positive results for 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.050
 these natural resources a plant that 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.460
 has the best circular system 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.800
 developed it will better explore the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.380
 soil to obtain these nutrients and this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.320
 water and this is reflected in better plant 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.620
 well nourished and what is the advantage of this 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.020
 are several at the time that exposes you by 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.180
 example this situation here is grazing 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.030
 more intensive what will happen 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.800
 this plant will need to regrow it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.260
 will recruit much better and with much 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.520
 more power will recruit faster 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.340
 because it has a system 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.020
 root system developed in this 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 situation is that it will take longer to 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.270
 regrowth root system is more 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.100
 shallow less developed in terms of 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.350
 mass and shallower 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.990
 the time I saw a frost that is common in the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.910
 our winter this vegetation here 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.130
 to be better protected because of 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.110
 mass it will go 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.820
 regrow the fastest too because she 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.580
 is better in the trio attacked greater mass 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.500
 management of soil and field 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.080
 also without results in relation to a 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.520
 the main problems related to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.410
 rural production 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.030
 The time I saw is the drought that is very common. 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.720
 in our region and the whole 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 south 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.460
 How do you dry the water? 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.090
 is becoming increasingly available 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.400
 depth and then what happens in this 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.980
 situation here as the root she is in 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.850
 she searches for this water 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.610
 down there 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.700
 then the field persists for longer 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.490
 hour begins to tighten or dry 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.700
 as the one here as the arraia is 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.410
 very concentrated in the surface what 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.070
 will happen with this field will feel 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.940
 much earlier the drought and the time that 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.710
 back to rain that's so important right? 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.220
 ae is coming back because the water for 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.020
 system and the vast majority of 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.200
 production systems depend on the water 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.880
 rain that will happen in this situation 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.100
 here the rainwater will fall into the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.770
 vegetation and slowly reach 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.109
 surface will filter while 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.020
 that in this situation here we will have 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.600
 a smaller infiltration then into a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.780
 sock 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.520
 A rain here in this system goes 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.250
 more water into the soil than 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.380
 in this system and how this system 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.870
 which already has more roots 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.730
 this passage will recover from the drought 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.820
 also much faster than this 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.670
 hence the natural landscape of the pampa biome 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.130
 have typical characteristics that go 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.560
 is underneath this green layer too 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.870
 has its specific attributes 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.850
 the soils of our biome they 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.130
 are basically characterized as being 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.130
 and you can see in this 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.040
 monolith here has a stone line 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.930
 so is the depth and effectiveness of it is 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.090
 a little more there than 60 and 70 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.010
 centimeters on this soil here is the same 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.440
 thing a little below that already begins 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.910
 a line of stone also then alone 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.030
 because they are quite 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.850
 weathered a rich organic material 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.580
 have good fertility but are poorly 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.560
 are shallow and that's what this is 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.810
 characteristic of our 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.020
 soils here in the biome pampa shallow soils 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.390
 poorly drained with good fertility and is 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.530
 Clear field if that suits very well 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.270
 This environment is not 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.540
 we can see that his answer is 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.880
 very good right and management is a factor 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.210
 very important in this relation between 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.310
 soil and plant this correct management does not 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.920
 benefits only to the balance of the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.690
 biome the native fields of the pampas are 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.540
 traditionally used to 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.850
 cattle ranching, so the zeal with the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.460
 natural resources allows animals to 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.800
 have a greater availability of supply 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.350
 and forage quality 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.170
 as the producer begins to 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.090
 understand the role that the role that the 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.320
 grazing management has been exercised in the 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.690
 construction of the type of vegetation cover 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.270
 that it has or in the type that field or 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.640
 of the species that the field has it begins 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.130
 to take some of the control of the 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.440
 grazing as a way to change the 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.690
 field composition né 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.560
 when he starts doing it so with 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.860
 extremely simple tools like 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.110
 as the stocking adjustment 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.570
 and this he starts to climb a little more 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.669
 including the potentials that those who 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.340
 different types of fields they 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.020
 can offer the developer 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.750
 an area of ​​the countryside to rest for a 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.490
 good management strategy. 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.710
 researcher gives some tips on how to 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.960
 this practice can be initiated 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.180
 what we have observed that the 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.130
 best time to take a break 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.750
 field if you start the pension 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.340
 country children is not to lose those 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.190
 moments of greater abundance of resources 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.410
 as precipitation as temperature 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.790
 in those moments when, naturally, the 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.470
 production system it becomes more 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.000
 loose right 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.250
 at that point we will start 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.590
 think what areas he could choose 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.080
 a beautiful opportunity to discover 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.700
 what are the potential that 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.639
 different areas of the production system 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.650
 and there are days when we start we went 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.600
 We can start, I recommend that if 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.310
 should start with those areas that 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.160
 respond better is this period of 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.580
 rest a rest he compromise 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.560
 - to postpone a routine system 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.720
 the bank and man can 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.160
 to live harmoniously 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.770
 but for this to occur 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.289
 the fundamental input is 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.289
 essential knowledge
