their style at that time you know there
was<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.269> big<00:00:56.539> separation<00:00:57.350> between<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.670> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
was a big separation between the the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.060 
was a big separation between the the
style<00:00:59.449> of<00:00:59.749> reining<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.589> East<00:01:00.769> Coast

style of reining on the East Coast

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.399

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.930 
versus the style of reining on the west
coast<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:05.030> style<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:06.580> think<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.700> lot

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
coast and that style I think a lot

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.390 
coast and that style I think a lot
developed<00:01:08.690> because<00:01:09.050> of<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.920> lot<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.280> the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
developed because of a lot of the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.870 
developed because of a lot of the

ground you know back in back in Ohio the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.389 
ground you know back in back in Ohio the
ground<00:01:49.280> was<00:01:49.549> very<00:01:50.079> well<00:01:51.079> prepared<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.920> was<00:01:52.070> it

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
ground was very well prepared it was it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.050 
ground was very well prepared it was it
was<00:01:52.549> slick<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:54.100> which<00:01:55.100> enabled<00:01:55.549> those<00:01:55.729> horses

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
was slick and which enabled those horses

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060 
was slick and which enabled those horses
to<00:01:56.210> go<00:01:56.539> a<00:01:56.570> long<00:01:56.810> ways

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
to go a long ways

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.389 
to go a long ways
these<00:01:58.490> horses<00:01:58.939> here<00:01:59.500> again<00:02:00.500> didn't<00:02:01.070> go<00:02:01.219> that

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
these horses here again didn't go that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.940 
these horses here again didn't go that
far<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.090> we're<00:02:02.240> very<00:02:02.539> powerful<00:02:03.229> doing<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.740> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
far but we're very powerful doing it and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.569 
far but we're very powerful doing it and
so<00:02:04.670> again<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.329> was<00:02:05.450> part<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:06.549> something<00:02:07.549> that

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
so again that was part of something that

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.280 
so again that was part of something that
I<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.330> was<00:02:08.690> appealed<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.710> me<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.990> possibly<00:02:11.990> be

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
I I was appealed to me to possibly be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.080 
I I was appealed to me to possibly be
able<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.590> learn<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.130> stopping<00:02:13.640> any<00:02:13.760> kind<00:02:14.060> of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
able to learn to do stopping any kind of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.250 
able to learn to do stopping any kind of
ground

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
ground

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.960 
ground
the<00:02:16.260> whole<00:02:16.439> thing<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.829> much<00:02:17.069> more<00:02:17.280> collected

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the whole thing was much more collected

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.069 
the whole thing was much more collected
maybe<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:19.019> little<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:19.739> finesse<00:02:19.980> ville<00:02:20.370> than

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
maybe a little more finesse ville than

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.990 
maybe a little more finesse ville than
what<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.230> East<00:02:22.439> Coast<00:02:22.739> raining<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.879> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
what the East Coast raining was at that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.539 
what the East Coast raining was at that
time<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> kind<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.950> developed<00:02:26.400> and

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
time and it is kind of developed and
