simple you just pick notes out of the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.430 
simple you just pick notes out of the
scale<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> key<00:01:57.360> things<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
scale so one of the key things is to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.160 
scale so one of the key things is to
learn<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> notes<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.330> scale<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.050> is

learn the notes in your scale this is
we're<00:02:01.320> learning<00:02:01.440> your<00:02:01.679> scale<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.070> comes

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
we're learning your scale really comes

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.279 
we're learning your scale really comes
in<00:02:02.460> handy<00:02:02.490> especially<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.810> E<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
in handy especially on the E and a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.230 
in handy especially on the E and a
strange<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:04.800> that's<00:02:05.039> most<00:02:05.340> where<00:02:06.119> you're

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
strange because that's most where you're

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.499 
strange because that's most where you're
passing<00:02:06.630> notes<00:02:06.750> come<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.830> example

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
passing notes come from so for example

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.100 
passing notes come from so for example
the<00:02:09.509> notes<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.019> choose<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:11.989> let<00:02:12.989> me

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the notes you have to choose from let me

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.170 
the notes you have to choose from let me
go<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.850> me<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.300> could<00:02:15.540> use<00:02:15.720> D<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> be

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
go to me so I could use D to get to be

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.740 
go to me so I could use D to get to be
so<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:18.780> gonna<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.530 

and<00:02:27.320> what<00:02:28.160> I'm<00:02:28.250> doing<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.610> I'm<00:02:28.790> holding<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.510> E

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and what I'm doing is I'm holding the E

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.610 
and what I'm doing is I'm holding the E
chord<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.930> changing<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.990> bass<00:02:33.170> note<00:02:33.410> while

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
chord and changing the bass note while

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.090 
chord and changing the bass note while
holding<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.310> Gordon<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> get<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:36.890> kind

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
holding that Gordon so you get this kind

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.430 
holding that Gordon so you get this kind
of<00:02:37.220> cool<00:02:37.540> slightly<00:02:38.540> dissonant<00:02:39.110> thing<00:02:39.260> going

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
of cool slightly dissonant thing going

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.820 
of cool slightly dissonant thing going
on<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.740> go<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.160> beach<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.650> I'm<00:02:42.740> just

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
on and go to the beach then I'm just

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.680 
on and go to the beach then I'm just
going<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> make<00:02:43.490> up<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.820> riff<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.390> by<00:02:44.540> using

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
going to make up a riff just by using

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370 
going to make up a riff just by using
the<00:02:44.930> first<00:02:45.170> three<00:02:45.440> notes<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.770> scale<00:02:47.380> it's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the first three notes of the scale it's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.690 
the first three notes of the scale it's
kind<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.770> break<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:49.310> between<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
kind of like a break in between the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.040 
kind of like a break in between the
rhythm<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.690> got<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.080 

so<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> scale<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.490> using<00:03:02.700> this

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so going up the scale if I'm using this

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.330 
so going up the scale if I'm using this
as<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> little<00:03:04.170> riff<00:03:05.870> next<00:03:06.870> note<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.250> we

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
as a little riff next note is a so if we

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820 
as a little riff next note is a so if we
got<00:03:08.460> an<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.700> chord<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.180> gonna<00:03:09.320> sound<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
got an a chord it's gonna sound like it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.800 
got an a chord it's gonna sound like it
belongs<00:03:11.160> there<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.890> go<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.070> an<00:03:14.190> A

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.960 

and<00:03:17.620> then<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.220> gonna<00:03:18.310> do<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.520> same<00:03:18.730> thing

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
and then I'm gonna do the same thing

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.160 
and then I'm gonna do the same thing
going<00:03:19.239> up<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.599> scene

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.200 

and<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.320> lot<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.710> depends<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.910> rhythm

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
and a lot of this depends on the rhythm

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.060 
and a lot of this depends on the rhythm
that<00:03:30.300> you're<00:03:30.450> playing<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.530> could<00:03:31.560> be<00:03:31.800> doing

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
that you're playing you could be doing

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.130 
that you're playing you could be doing
any<00:03:32.370> style<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.850> music<00:03:32.940> country<00:03:33.480> acoustic

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
any style of music country acoustic

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.790 
any style of music country acoustic
metal<00:03:35.040> thrash<00:03:36.080> I'm<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.260> kind<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.470> doing<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
metal thrash I'm just kind of doing a

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.400 
metal thrash I'm just kind of doing a
rock<00:03:38.040> classic<00:03:38.610> rock<00:03:38.670> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.120> feel<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.110> I've

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
rock classic rock kind of feel so I've

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.840 
rock classic rock kind of feel so I've
got<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.740> rhythm<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.580> whatever

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
got that rhythm going on but whatever

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.540 
got that rhythm going on but whatever
rhythm<00:03:42.360> you're<00:03:43.320> using<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.860> example<00:03:43.920> if<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.400> use

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
rhythm you're using for example if I use

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.180 
rhythm you're using for example if I use
a<00:03:44.580> different

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.560 

it<00:03:53.190> sounds<00:03:53.520> totally<00:03:53.670> different<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
it sounds totally different but the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.360 
it sounds totally different but the
concept<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> same<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.620> any<00:03:55.950> style<00:03:56.280> of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
concept is the same for any style of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.010 
concept is the same for any style of
music<00:03:56.460> so<00:03:56.790> that's<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:57.030> cool<00:03:57.180> part<00:03:57.480> here's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
music so that's a cool part here's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.220 
music so that's a cool part here's
another<00:03:58.230> way<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.710> change<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.850> way<00:04:00.060> you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
another way you can change the way you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.170 
another way you can change the way you
by<00:04:01.230> changing<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.800> way<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:01.920> accent1<00:04:02.490> note<00:04:02.880> can

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
by changing the way you accent1 note can

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.930 
by changing the way you accent1 note can
really<00:04:03.420> affect<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.980> way<00:04:05.130> your<00:04:05.430> song<00:04:05.700> is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
really affect the way your song is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.370 
really affect the way your song is
sounding<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.750> did<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.290> heat<00:04:07.530> thing<00:04:09.380> and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
sounding so I did this heat thing and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.520 
sounding so I did this heat thing and
then<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:10.860> did<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> could<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.140> add<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> little

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
then I did so I could just add a little

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.729 
then I did so I could just add a little
vibrato<00:04:15.019> work<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.140> out<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.260> little<00:04:16.470> pinch

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
vibrato work it out a little pinch

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.600 
vibrato work it out a little pinch
harmonic<00:04:17.930> or<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:18.959> could<00:04:19.200> make<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> open<00:04:20.430> power

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
harmonic or I could make it a open power

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.030 
harmonic or I could make it a open power
cord

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.830 

another<00:04:24.040> way<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.520> change<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.300> way<00:04:25.449> a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
another way you can change the way a

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.950 
another way you can change the way a
song<00:04:26.440> flows<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.400> your<00:04:27.550> writing<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.090> by

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
song flows that your writing is by

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.379 
song flows that your writing is by
spending<00:04:29.710> less<00:04:30.100> time<00:04:30.130> or<00:04:30.639> more<00:04:30.790> time<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
spending less time or more time on a

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.360 
spending less time or more time on a
cord<00:04:31.810> during<00:04:32.110> your<00:04:32.199> chord<00:04:32.410> change<00:04:32.680> for

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
cord during your chord change for

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.909 
cord during your chord change for
instance<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.850> thing<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.300> was<00:04:34.389> just<00:04:34.570> playing

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.719 

originally<00:04:38.919> I<00:04:38.949> was<00:04:39.039> playing<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.370> longer

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.939 

spending<00:04:42.729> more<00:04:42.880> time<00:04:42.940> line<00:04:43.270> score<00:04:43.949> might

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
spending more time line score might

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:56.090 
spending more time line score might
tighten<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.340> all<00:04:45.490> up<00:04:45.729> you<00:04:45.880> get<00:04:46.030> this

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.750 

so<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.270> by<00:04:57.480> adding<00:04:57.960> less<00:04:58.490> spending<00:04:59.490> less

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
so you see by adding less spending less

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.480 
so you see by adding less spending less
time<00:04:59.790> on<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.210> cord<00:05:00.480> or<00:05:00.600> more<00:05:00.780> time<00:05:00.990> an<00:05:01.110> accord
