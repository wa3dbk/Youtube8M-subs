first<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> remove<00:00:23.609> these<00:00:23.880> screws

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
first we have to remove these screws

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.710 
first we have to remove these screws
here<00:00:24.650> now<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> screws<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.340> talks<00:00:26.720> talks

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
here now the screws are talks talks

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.859 
here now the screws are talks talks
screws<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.500> need<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> Torx<00:00:29.189> screwdriver<00:00:29.869> so

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
screws so you need a Torx screwdriver so

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.680 
screws so you need a Torx screwdriver so
before<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.800> start<00:00:32.279> doing<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.000> make

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
before you start doing this just make

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.500 
before you start doing this just make
sure<00:00:33.870> you've<00:00:34.020> got<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.260> correct<00:00:35.239> screw<00:00:36.239> driver

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
sure you've got the correct screw driver

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.020 
sure you've got the correct screw driver
else<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> won't<00:00:37.170> data<00:00:37.440> getting<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> drive

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
else you won't data getting to the drive

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990 
else you won't data getting to the drive
itself<00:00:39.680> as<00:00:40.680> mentioned<00:00:41.160> before<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.940> just

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
itself as mentioned before I'm just

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.130 
itself as mentioned before I'm just
doing<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.840> purely<00:00:43.610> informational

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
doing this for purely informational

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.660 
doing this for purely informational
reasons<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> hard<00:00:46.829> drive<00:00:46.890> itself<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
reasons and the hard drive itself is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.900 
reasons and the hard drive itself is
dead<00:00:48.090> already

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
dead already

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
dead already
so<00:00:50.910> once<00:00:51.510> we've<00:00:51.719> removed<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.469> screws

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so once we've removed all these screws

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.930 
so once we've removed all these screws
there<00:00:53.250> may<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.719> screw<00:00:55.579> under<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> label

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there may be a can screw under the label

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.959 
there may be a can screw under the label
but<00:00:57.300> we'll<00:00:57.480> soon<00:00:57.750> find<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> just

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
but we'll soon find out you know just

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.880 
but we'll soon find out you know just
get<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.430> go

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.240 

so<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.480> little<00:01:11.930> screwdriver<00:01:12.890> to

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
so it's like a little screwdriver to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:22.150 
so it's like a little screwdriver to
wedge<00:01:13.490> under<00:01:13.880> there<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.720> looks<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:21.160> we

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
wedge under there and it looks like we

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.940 
wedge under there and it looks like we
do<00:01:22.460> have<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.730> hidden<00:01:23.090> screw<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.110> just<00:01:24.560> try<00:01:24.920> to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
do have a hidden screw so just try to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.460 
do have a hidden screw so just try to
remove<00:01:25.400> this<00:01:25.640> label<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.630> see<00:01:26.840> if<00:01:26.900> we<00:01:27.020> can<00:01:27.170> find

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
remove this label to see if we can find

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.930 
remove this label to see if we can find
out<00:01:28.030> where<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.060> hidden<00:01:29.690> screw<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:31.810> now<00:01:32.810> looks

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
out where that hidden screw is now looks

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.450 
out where that hidden screw is now looks
looking<00:01:34.940> like<00:01:35.180> it's<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.630> there<00:01:36.460> yes<00:01:37.460> correct

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.320 

so<00:01:43.460> it's<00:01:43.640> actually<00:01:43.790> hidden<00:01:44.180> under<00:01:44.770> two<00:01:45.770> labels

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
so it's actually hidden under two labels

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.090 
so it's actually hidden under two labels
we've<00:01:47.330> got<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.630> normal<00:01:47.810> harddrive<00:01:48.680> label

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
we've got the normal harddrive label

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.880 
we've got the normal harddrive label
then<00:01:49.280> there's<00:01:49.520> another<00:01:49.610> label<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.390> and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
then there's another label there and

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.440 
then there's another label there and
there<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.010> go<00:01:53.260> that's<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> insides<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
there we go that's the insides of the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.080 
there we go that's the insides of the
hard<00:01:56.450> drive<00:01:56.720> itself<00:01:57.640> we've<00:01:58.640> got<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> disk

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
hard drive itself we've got the disk

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.120 
hard drive itself we've got the disk
platters<00:01:59.510> they<00:01:59.720> spin<00:02:00.170> around<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
platters they spin around and the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460 
platters they spin around and the
read/write<00:02:01.340> head<00:02:01.610> which<00:02:02.270> moves<00:02:02.869> across<00:02:03.170> and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
read/write head which moves across and

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.250 
read/write head which moves across and
reads<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.920> data<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.090> they're<00:02:05.660> very<00:02:05.690> as<00:02:06.170> you

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
reads the data so they're very as you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.840 
reads the data so they're very as you
can<00:02:06.380> see<00:02:06.530> very<00:02:06.560> shiny<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.310> can<00:02:07.430> probably<00:02:07.610> see

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
can see very shiny you can probably see

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.660 
can see very shiny you can probably see
