00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 tactical wolak x masters in that a new 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 which implies mind call of duty goes to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 final I'll get used to it and it's about to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
 copy figure 2 but good and good what 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 first of all encounter is that I have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.079
 a horrible headache and quite 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 stomach pain and I 'm not feeling well 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.220
 and I'm going to try to get over it to do 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.349
 this comment and nothing guys I'm going to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 start in a somewhat special way 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.520
 and is saying saying is very 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.679
 good guy does not matter and is saying 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.179
 the gameplay itself yes that is something not very 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.440
 normal in me but I'm seeing 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.640
 that I'm going to run out of time 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.589
 I'm going to say nothing about the gameplay is not 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 good plan is playing with lacquer 12 with 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.320
 silencer loaders extended in a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.239
 map of which I do not know the name because 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 just started the game is a thirty 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.850
 and peak to fifteen or that's good 31-32 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.079
 neither are thirty and a peak to 15 we go 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.819
 proportion of 2 did not start quite 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.559
 moved that is what matters I die 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.839
 quite in very false ways a lot 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.269
 campero so that the normal things of 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.640
 call of duty and I got streak did not reach the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.409
 mania that we do not have illusions and I have 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 best saves for the saved 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.020
 I will not lie I have a better game 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 because it 's saved because I do not get sacked 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.780
 gameplays from what 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.259
 the last time I played by the way was 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 yesterday the last game so good 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.229
 nothing that came with a thing that I suppose 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 that you will have seen in titles but good 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.350
 degrees I repeat it again because 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 I am special they are very intelligent and very 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.270
 cool movie mode 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.010
 the end that zinc comes is incredible 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.540
 which is useful to see them and that was very useful 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.980
 and well let's go back to their 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.570
 origins if I'm not wrong the first one in 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.240
 doing it was treyarch m is amazing 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.510
 whites one is game so weird that ball 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:53.190
 so much and that what that ball although it is weird 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:54.600
 and that I have to upload the ticos uploaded 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.340
 so much but good this all everything 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.570
 the world that upload ghosts but good if 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.610
 you want to see the gameplay we're going to make a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.050
 thing when this video reaches 5 likes 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.850
 the day after the video reaches 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.560
 5 the exists x 5 like they are very little but 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.149
 is that I want to upload the video and besides 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 It's no use asking too much to ask for little more 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.679
 if you get you can get to it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.020
 I upload the gameplay of code duty black ops 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.440
 1 good so nothing that the video comes 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.930
 to 5 likes you know it's not much we go 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.459
 come 25 likes it costs us nothing at 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 better arrive until today if there is luck 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.520
 possibly not because I'm uploading it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.350
 a day of life and a few days of daily 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.780
 I know why I have less audience than 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.489
 custom but good does not matter 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.630
 tell you the cinema mode not this so 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.270
 it's better to start commenting on the mode 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.270
 cinema and good to cinema mode in black ops 1 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.550
 he loved he liked everyone said that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.200
 They were wonderful great spectacular 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.000
 despite their failures was the first mode 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.040
 cinema they got they never had that excuse 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.870
 and the truth is that you now get in and 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.820
 if it were not because of per se the black 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.790
 ops one has dips of fps is every two 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.470
 by three and that cinema mode already has 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.270
 the odd one because the truth is that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.680
 it's fine it works better than enough 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.140
 other ways it has and the truth is me 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.450
 love that cinema mode of black ops 1 the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.770
 original the coolest the coolest 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.470
 plus 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.960
 that already begins to repeat me but good 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.520
 then activision picked up on this idea and I'm going 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.830
 to put the cinema mode in the modern 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.150
 warfare 3 and everyone was complaining and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.500
 he complained and complained and nobody 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.450
 I liked emotions Wolfart is that if it is 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.770
 a shit that says that if not 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.660
 they did more than basically mess with 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.310
 the cinema mode that did have many failures 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.130
 but they no longer had the excuse and that was the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.280
 first cinema mode and of course how much 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.350
 people complained because what happens happens 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.130
 that then we come to the call of duty black 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.800
 ops' 2 and activision gave activision and 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.060
 treyarch sorry I confuse good I think 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400
 which is also activision activision and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.360
 good treyarch 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.769
 they make this incredible cinema mode with 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.200
 as many failures as is the 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.700
 black ops 2 that did not have as many as 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.459
 one modern warfare 3 but had also 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.340
 a lot and what happens they go back to 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.470
 criticize then if you criticize a lot the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.480
 cinema mode of one game and that of another already 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.540
 arrives infinity ward is a new game 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.220
 called here call of duty cous tomato 4 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.189
 I eat and the asshole for the truth 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.629
 honestly and says I'm going to do something 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.430
 so that they complain about me and tell me that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.319
 it is badly done and does not make more criticism in 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.690
 the game that's why we're going to remove it to see 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.940
 what they say to see what happens and we can win 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.400
 money with this because of course if you criticize 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.539
 very much one thing that is very useful the only thing 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.459
 what you are going to get is that they remove it 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.660
 example many people criticized that 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.490
 had more cheto in modern warfare 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.080
 3 you hit the target but herbs cheto 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.240
 that people started complaining but 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.550
 they had machete does not make any sense 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.950
 Boys 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.950
 what people think so 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.750
 basically they have removed cinema mode yes and 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.220
 have thought how many people are 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.020
 complaining all these people are going to be able 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.840
 buy a cinema mode if we put it on 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.210
 sure and have said it 's good movie mode of 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.430
 payment fixed and they will take out the mode 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.660
 cinema with a dlc yes they are very clever if 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.400
 everyone criticizes it is easy 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.170
 remove it and then put it back that's 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.880
 simpler you say then for the people 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.100
 that I need it I put it as payment 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.660
 the maps and all the milk because in case 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.280
 you have not noticed the packs of 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.140
 maps also criticized the modern 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.030
 warfare 3 take free maps and the 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.240
 they criticize that they pass whites 2 nor a single 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.370
 free map then nothing anymore they're not going to 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 get anything free if we stop 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.900
 criticize and settle a little 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.640
 it would be easier because of course you now 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.320
 you get in the way of new parts and it goes 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.050
 for everyone now look it's true because 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.490
 had a weird thing to the sides should 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.840
 stop the white but if you cut the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.190
 that I'm halfway through but of course it's 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.300
 better to have a cinema mode that works 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.560
 once in a while he has some small 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.630
 failure like moving to the sides 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.710
 of new warfare 3 or not having any 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.840
 like in this game and they're going to 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.970
 put then for what it costs the first 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.380
 dlc I suppose for a separate dlc that 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.780
 it will cost two euros we go but 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.670
 what is a money that must be put and 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.440
 well guys there's a story of why 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.450
 I think that in cinema mode will be 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.570
 payment and good still enough 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.360
 gameplay and by quite I mean 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.920
 exactly two minutes and about 20 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.069
 seconds 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.710
 I believe no yes no yes 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.490
 no yes saying no if there is one minute left and 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.889
 medium 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.169
 and they are robbed in Jorge as you want 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.360
 call me take the sniper tió malditos a 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.919
 new level of the game good so already 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.099
 that I have this time I will take advantage of 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.060
 eating something else because the other day 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.400
 good on another day already quite 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.389
 time and the video of the myth of the 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.129
 dedicated servers guys there was a 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.360
 person that I think my friend and he 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.250
 I said it but good if someone 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.690
 I had some doubt and I think it will be a 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.490
 person let's go that nothing else because if 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.400
 my friend has been told 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.610
 he told me that he's alone and that the servers 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.349
 dedicated are not good and 4 and xbox one 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.789
 guys I'm informing myself before 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.000
 make that comment as it's obvious I'm 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.530
 watching my videos and good first thing in 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 principle the Serbs dedicated a Ivan 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.220
 to be in xbox when then what 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.590
 expanded apply 4 and in the end they finished 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.470
 saying they were going to be in wii on xbox 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.539
 360 and in play 3 the thing is that they are not 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.990
 well and 3 neither in xbox 360 and in willow 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.630
 good 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.120
 until there it did not arrive in play 4 and in xbox 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.009
 how safe they are and here I suppose 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.530
 they will end up taking out the 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.270
 they will end up taking out but for the one that has 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.650
 some doubt if in theory it should have 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.590
 Dedicated servers takes name 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.389
 carpet in call of duty coast is worth 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.430
 It was not very rug but the guy kills me 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.569
 and roy mousepad but that follows the
