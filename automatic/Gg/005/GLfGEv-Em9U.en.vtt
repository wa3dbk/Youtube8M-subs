 It smells funny discussion Inge finally got two of his own strangely 5 stars 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 In such a case , there was a lack of relief in the party, and there was no limit. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.540
 It's a good way to get a broadcast room. 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.960
 Which it is gonna be a lot of fun as well as other helpful intermittent positive that way 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.800
 It is very important to propose through the candidate as well as lactic acid times as important 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.519
 I admit it . That's the way it is. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.779
 It is. 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 Fetal Development Limited Real Water Is Possible Experience and Regulate In Some Way 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.079
 When are you thinking, albeit not to want to prove that HA cc Rossum 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 I love you , Yantai, the true lawful work of the market damage 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 2364 It is the king. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 Besides illegal market size of nearly 300 billion won like 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.280
 Enforcement is difficult and it is so much you can do to be a waste of money now 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 There Are So please speak alone 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 We do not want to crack down on them . 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.239
 It is pointing out that it is not 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.410
 Copies of college colleges are literally a reality for students. 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 Do you think that students can do to change the reality and over crackdown 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.350
 That was only right that we continue to keep present and I need to talk to Daeam 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.680
 Education has never been more educational, 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 Because education can not be changed at once, 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.450
 What exactly is in the vassal to go to the mountains to present together 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 Most of the time I'm actually doing it now 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 Do not let the vote clone 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.130
 What then it is that the gum elastic than we are now discussing and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.759
 The four main characters are the City University of Unite are more than 50,000 professors strength 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.250
 According to the data, the purpose is to study English, so I will try to use it free of charge. 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.250
 I know you answered 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 U 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.500
 Not dawn natdago Chinese professors saw fit'll find out how well the survey 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.540
 I'm curious. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 In Korea University News In an interview with the professor if there is no answer to cancer and objectives 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.360
 I emphasized it unconditionally. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.140
 Oh well not that the cat haneungeo this fare and college in production 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.820
 Because it is hard for them to be hard, you have to hurt others. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.490
 You think so. 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.270
 How do you prove you can crack down and improve it? 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 However, rather library is currently occupied by students can lead to resistance to crack down but 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.370
 There may be a problem of revolutionary bloody equity in the crackdown. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 Do you recognize this immunity to the problem then please tell in the end time at home 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:30.130
 There is no need to say what you want about the opponents tarnished if nothing 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.030
 You should not crack down on copyright protection 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.420
 I mean, once in the copyright law, we're centralizing the perception. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.810
 An alternative to the Turn Left Act is to not ignore the Beggar Act 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.890
 One of the strong regulations is that our side is towed 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.120
 But some of you guys said it's not easy, but students can die too. 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.269
 not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.709
 And, as I said before, the professors know that the students 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:58.690
 Most of them said that they would shoot 1 not to watch 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:02.620
 Tego's going to stick to continue the investigation beyond the frame Now that this application is 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.860
 It's very dangerous. It's dangerous and not in a hybrid. 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.170
 If done well it is also gonna be a great price discussion that integrates records 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.090
 I have not seen it yet. Dream River 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 There's more international to suggest alternatives, but I got it. 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.190
 I bought the medicine and slept 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180
 The awareness and the family continues to emphasize that can be made as semi-hollow 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.510
 You did. 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.980
 You showed me some solid proof of that. 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.580
 If you're in charge, each such extreme there are now about Il Kim 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.630
 Because when you swear on his total years of pyeongsari Indra 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.400
 There is a law Book people do not do what they should not do at first 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:44.410
 But even though I do, even now, even my thoughts, 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.430
 Oh, it was the reason that He is the Higher . 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:53.109
 And I want to talk to you again. 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.950
 As we continue to say that the law is not municipal, 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:00.430
 There are alternatives to some extent with the recognition haejusigo So do not tell the crew 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.450
 I 'm thinking too much of a tilt to one side. 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.870
 Gangryeokbu now under way in the system because there is no alternative eojjeonyago want to talk about 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.169
 It is. 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.519
 He's a very effective word, no limit, 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.209
 Haha did you shovel all going to be expected to continue to tack something out alternatives 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.200
 will be 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:22.210
 Sometimes it's not coming in direct will continue to damage the ac rg 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.630
 I save it seven times I can not get the premium. And now , 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.630
 I'm nervous.
