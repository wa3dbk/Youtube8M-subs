00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 Comparison of two 2 devices of two units

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.509

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.680
 hid mcdonalds mafia 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 as thick as a globe to round 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.880
 balls and people walked constantly lined up 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 standing in line constantly billion dollars 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.540

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.399
 worked first like in america very 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.750
 such a popular topic I do not remember how 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.190
 called those people can me in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 comments tell me remind 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.600
 when a man goes from house to house them 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.430
 mostly private homes yes she don't take in 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.350
 calculation account new york country house how 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.239
 people live ordinary apartments and often 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.400
 these apartments are even smaller than Moscow 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.700
 but this is not the point again I bow away 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.010
 Here and here in America is very developed to huyam 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.050
 kolyan again forgot the name of the fucking hook 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.820
 I want a suitcase dick knows what goes on 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.980
 houses in different apartments is not an apartment 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.130
 home knocking at every house and what 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.050
 offers something trying to push here 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.760
 actually and this one seems dude 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.830
 which led to bend he gave saying here 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.769
 so that's the errand man that I don't 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.620
 I know here and here somehow I do not remember how 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.209
 one of the story I honestly did not read here 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.070
 but in short, this did not work out 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.959
 We go to start this colossus to do 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.370
 damn it's simple but quality respect 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.590
 Respect fucking this dude 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.780
 here firstly it is certainly tasty 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.360
 cool but bad it is clear all this 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.060
 understands that there are people when they buy 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 want to enjoy food but 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.970
 accordingly if you fucking want 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.769
 lose weight and healthy lifestyle to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.500
 the liver there did not hurt there knowledge 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.150
 got stuck there I don't know what's there 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.640
 further it is necessary to fucking eat this one 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.549
 crude crude communities need 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.760
 cucumbers and tomatoes and cabbage damn 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.079
 carrot I do not know everyone understands 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.420
 that's right that's why okay shorter 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.880
 distracted from the topic let's go 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.890
 let's unpack let's take a closer look I'll try 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.230
 camera to send closer like this 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.739
 here it means the type is like in all these 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.590
 rolls 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.750
 there is such a clue as here 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.720
 a pack of cigarettes that fierce pull like 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.910
 and it turns out, let me get you 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.930
 I will show more in detail what is here at all 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
 this box is 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.720
 and you showed me 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.540
 although in principle there is nothing special 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.730
 what legend they have is not written like u 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.980
 bottom max frisch and on chikin max frisch there 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.329
 written all sorts there still consists like 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 like this open further to the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.590
 The instruction is how to open type 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.189
 see yes that is, but how to appear 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.890
 all the same thing i 'm doing here but 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.310
 actually all opened for thrashing 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.979
 I apologize for vulgarity here it smells 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.199
 thing she smells you know she smells 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.570
 not beef burgers donat beef 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.660
 cutlet but it smells like real 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.880
 well here's a hamburger for example yes but he doesn't 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.350
 It smells like a hamburger that's the thing though 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.389
 there and there galleys cutlets here are you 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.300
 here plow more real meat 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.419
 trial on all straight meat somehow 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.729
 stuffing did not know here is shorter get that 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.320
 us here we see we have pita but in 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.479
 principle by and large any roll 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.349
 It could offhand and large do not know 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.060
 roughly speaking 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.250
 shawarma roughly speaking if very rude 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.180
 speak here now 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.160
 unfold yes at least look at all 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.199
 just a little nothing damn at all 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.780
 just cutlet so healthy see yes 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.870
 is a healthy healthy cutlet that 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.000
 folded as if in half into a tube 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.520
 well, nicely roasted aunts 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.440
 you can see it evenly 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.110
 arugula if I am not mistaken this hand i can 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.010
 err correct me all for shit 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.760
 so what else do we have here 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:26.220
 there is a lot of mayonnaise 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:28.320
 lettuce leaves cheese yes actually probably 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.000
 all over again here this is dark 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.010
 dark green full after all arugula I 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.229
 I can be wrong but actually all that 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.270
 there is nothing much worth beef roll 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.030
 123 rubles I have already spoken on the topic not 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.889
 I repeat that is like this 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.180
 pita them such a round small 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.460
 big chop 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.820
 but I donâ€™t know such thickness 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.560
 plump patties and actually nothing 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.120
 Especially I would be considered very much 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.090
 would hurt some tomato 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.159
 fresh I think so well, in general, such 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.380
 here is such on the king anboxing 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.520
 turned out 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.510
 with you I hope someone come in handy 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.190
 it will be interesting to someone to see 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.780
 write comments very interesting who 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.970
 of you tried this beef roll 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.310
 generally I liked but I liked it 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.680
 really smells like it usually and cutlets 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.450
 who are you stuffing it turned and cutlets 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.840
 Tuzha only from the stuffing from really straight so 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.640
 it smells 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.490
 cheating post I think it's big 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.260
 rare to smell straight natural 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.150
 products from which they were stored 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.720
 write and write that there chicken yes there 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.830
 the chicken of the chicken there seems to be weak 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.670
 it smells yes so we think 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.610
 but no less than we have here 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:45.200
 energy value written 500 10 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:48.230

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.910
 freshly prepared 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:01.430
 but again write comments this 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.440
 Another vidyushka from a series of reviews of food and 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:09.260
 smeared again this we had in 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:13.270
