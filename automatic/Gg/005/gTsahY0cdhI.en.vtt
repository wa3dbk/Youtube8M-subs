00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.520
 what amaze you now makes gelesi 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.309
 moments but the bullshit 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 I know this particularly in this case 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.670
 I understand why we talk about being 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 members who joined that is part of one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.059
 of our favorite series and it was one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.609
 of the most anticipated games of the year 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.310
 and all in all we have to say it is necessary 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 it is still early to judge the game 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 in itself we absolutely don't allow ourselves 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 to do a review as it was for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.769
 watchdog if this is not the review 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.380
 of the game and our reactions to some 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.759
 aspects that we didn't like at all 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.649
 let's say first of all that we are playing 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.690
 on playstation 4 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.850
 but we can assure you that much 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 of the problems that we would have been 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 witnessed by users on youtube also 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.110
 on xbox live and on pc it's not bad us 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.420
 really like the aesthetic aspect though 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.010
 in short, there is a bit of elias in those of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.820
 which this generation fails to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.489
 to break free 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 moreover, there are many bugs and glitches i 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.989
 present in the game now I do not remember if 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 also in assassin's creed black flag in 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 previous episodes were all there 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 but these bugs and glitches are here 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.360
 so let's talk about this episode 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.360
 look at us here 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.110
 all where to live and I saw that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.940
 we also found things 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.340
 hallucinating especially related to 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.080
 framerate injured kids of this game 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.930
 it is incredibly accurate dancer passes 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 from a classic acceptable result 30 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 fps 30 stops per second to results 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.170
 really indecent especially when 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.350
 there is so much crowd 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.970
 yet it should not be so I am not 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.680
 only companies want to say my no 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.920
 are consoles next gen 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.780
 yes no neighbors are wrong to talk 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.150
 those in which assassin's creed runs 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.950
 fucking good news is that not 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.960
 there are only slowdowns in the crowd 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 but also closed places also type 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.010
 inside a small temple 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.540
 church there are inexplicable 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.400
 slowdowns that even do 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.400
 dance the hair d arno 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.100
 in reality at some point everything 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410
 slows hair moves so 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.300
 strange then miter we have to do the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.140
 they want things that the writings stones 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.140
 unity because then 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 how it happened megaman that is in a moment 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.980
 I'm talking about software goes anteo 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.239
 I loosened everything and found them again 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.610
 hair like that without counting the various 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.970
 animations movements in short le 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.180
 Government collisions touch the ball not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.549
 it's just very fluid and clean politicians 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
 there you see that I create cumbersome and everything 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.690
 slow but what he did to us 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.610
 really spin the ball boxes says 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.260
 framerate and hair slowdowns 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.590
 fucking carts that stretch out a 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.230
 fucking dog were especially the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.299
 endless loading endless times of 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 loading, however, where it is not 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.400
 not even possible to fiddle with 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 character on duty running and I do it myself 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 would have ran jumped from point to point 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.319
 loading cannot be done now 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.269
 no queues there are those three fucking 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.769
 symbols that run between them and don't 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.450
 he understands why this is enough 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.220
 why 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.319
 also after those fucking symbols 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.940
 that rothen were in the upper right corner of the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.470
 screen 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.870
 check also the loading bar in 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.630
 certain circumstances that makes a lot of 90's and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.269
 meeting type took waits and we want 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.579
 talk about the combat system 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.450
 no, but we 're going to scream because 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:48.079
 we must the point is that I say to karaj 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.950
 I copied ubisoft from batman but 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.049
 copy the sleepbox as they left 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.780
 morton giving them in turn have 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.269
 then got a pocket cue then then 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.620
 they did it well because in assassin's 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.769
 creed must be done so badly 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.810
 have passed it is nothing then the 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.580
 this is the attempt of 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.739
 improve it by ubisoft there is 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.629
 been and actually now the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.700
 counterattack is not so automatic e 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.949
 this simply translates into one 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.280
 slower commands in a 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.049
 substantial lag ie in the sense when me 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.470
 I have to take to defend myself I have to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.160
 to think 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.560
 a second before because in reality it is one 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.479
 sort of lag between the moment the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.580
 enemy attacks is the moment when I 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.650
 then I go to talk about it and turn on the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.240
 finger the health finger over 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.430
 the enemy's head turns yellow 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.889
 just going to stick around 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.680
 expenses of realism because obviously it is 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.940
 all slow not to wait even more 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.770
 same movements during 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.510
 fighting does not seem to those of a 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.949
 real battle of mag 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.229
 other ones they used 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.060
 during the motion capture the actors 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.060
 same as the fans never simulated 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.400
 very very good guys obviously like 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 you know this the things they want said 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.449
 it only highlights the defects that are 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.830
 may occur at the beginning but not 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.620
 we know if we are going but a 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.720
 play a masterpiece we are still at a 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.539
 just under half so we can't 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.370
 judge up to this point now if 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.310
 it will be a question of peace if it is 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.889
 question of I do not know will steal 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.810
 because it is not just a fiat that with one 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.870
 peace will solve the long times of 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.120
 loading can resolve the dips of 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.120
 framerate but no more for kids 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.099
 obviously to you the final judgments e 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.620
 regards the images is not us 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:38.010
 we are with the song and then it will also come out 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.800
 the review the review will be apart 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.560
 made for watchdog it seems obvious that the 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.260
 game deserves its review and it is not 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.610
 said he won't be enthusiastic anyway 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.560
 but our problems 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.139
 we will have to consider otherwise we would be 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.139
 so strong is the soul
