00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.670 
we haven't had those in over a year but
we'll<00:02:48.600> compare<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.990> against<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> Maglite

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

you<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.140> them<00:03:25.380> focused<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.130> don't<00:03:26.340> really

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
you have them focused you don't really

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.070 
you have them focused you don't really
get<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.820> whole<00:03:26.970> lot<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.269> spill<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.780> don't<00:03:27.930> light

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
get a whole lot of spill you don't light

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.560 
get a whole lot of spill you don't light
up<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.290> wider<00:03:28.470> area<00:03:28.590> at<00:03:28.980> once<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.430> when<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.420> do

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
up a wider area at once and when you do

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.780 
up a wider area at once and when you do
unfocus<00:03:31.170> them<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:32.190> light<00:03:32.340> up<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.550> wider<00:03:32.700> area

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
unfocus them you light up a wider area

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.670 
unfocus them you light up a wider area
you<00:03:33.269> lose<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.690> throw<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.350> that's<00:03:34.530> why<00:03:34.650> I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you lose all the throw so that's why I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.259 
you lose all the throw so that's why I
really<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.340> pre<00:03:35.550> focus<00:03:35.910> lights<00:03:36.090> like

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
really like the pre focus lights like

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.820 
really like the pre focus lights like
this<00:03:36.420> with<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> reflector<00:03:37.200> because<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.739> get

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
this with a reflector because you get

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.170 
this with a reflector because you get
the<00:03:37.920> best<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> both<00:03:38.430> worlds<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.030> get

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the best of both worlds so you get

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.449 
the best of both worlds so you get
really<00:03:39.360> nice<00:03:39.510> spill<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.010> hot<00:03:41.160> spot

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
really nice spill and in the hot spot

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.580 
really nice spill and in the hot spot
you<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:42.120> light<00:03:42.300> up<00:03:42.330> whatever<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.470> you're

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
you can light up whatever it is you're

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530 
you can light up whatever it is you're
trying<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> light<00:03:43.980> up<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.820> I'll<00:03:45.180> zoom<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.420> on

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
trying to light up so I'll zoom in on

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.360 
trying to light up so I'll zoom in on
that<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:46.100> had<00:03:47.100> 100<00:03:47.430> feet<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:49.709> bush<00:03:49.860> obviously

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that I had 100 feet the bush obviously

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.800 
that I had 100 feet the bush obviously
15<00:03:50.700> feet<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.239> no<00:03:51.360> problem

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
15 feet it's no problem

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.060 
15 feet it's no problem
and<00:03:52.110> let's<00:03:52.290> drop<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> down<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.890> lower

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
and let's drop it down to the lower

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.400 
and let's drop it down to the lower
level<00:03:53.430> just<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:53.880> see<00:03:54.060> still<00:03:54.930> 100<00:03:55.260> feet

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
level just so you can see still 100 feet

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.710 
level just so you can see still 100 feet
does<00:03:56.070> really<00:03:56.730> really<00:03:57.000> well<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.600> see

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
does really really well I can see

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.320 
does really really well I can see
everything<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.140> there<00:03:58.380> very<00:03:59.370> clearly<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.090> of

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
everything out there very clearly and of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.729 
everything out there very clearly and of
course<00:04:00.510> 15<00:04:00.840> feet<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.080> no<00:04:01.200> problem

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
course 15 feet is no problem

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.100 
course 15 feet is no problem
but<00:04:02.610> hundred<00:04:02.940> feet<00:04:03.090> does<00:04:03.480> really<00:04:03.750> really<00:04:03.959> well

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
but hundred feet does really really well

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.080 
but hundred feet does really really well
and<00:04:04.890> you'll<00:04:05.070> see<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.700> second

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and you'll see here in just a second

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.380 
and you'll see here in just a second
even<00:04:06.989> out<00:04:07.200> beyond<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.650> hundred<00:04:07.739> feet<00:04:08.390> obviously

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
even out beyond a hundred feet obviously

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.850 
even out beyond a hundred feet obviously
it's<00:04:09.510> going<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.690> do<00:04:09.840> still<00:04:10.260> really<00:04:10.560> well<00:04:10.680> so

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
it's going to do still really well so

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.210 
it's going to do still really well so
let's<00:04:10.980> go<00:04:11.040> ahead<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.310> do<00:04:11.400> that

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
let's go ahead and go do that

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.490 
let's go ahead and go do that
okay<00:04:13.180> here's<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.450> longer<00:04:13.810> distance<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.380> the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
okay here's the longer distance with the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.970 
okay here's the longer distance with the
i6<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> got<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.850> 40<00:04:16.150> maglite<00:04:16.799> there's<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
i6 so I got the 40 maglite there's the

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.150 
i6 so I got the 40 maglite there's the
house<00:04:18.160> at<00:04:18.549> 50<00:04:19.390> feet<00:04:19.540> or<00:04:19.720> 50<00:04:20.140> yards<00:04:20.380> away<00:04:20.500> at<00:04:20.950> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
house at 50 feet or 50 yards away at the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160 
house at 50 feet or 50 yards away at the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
top of it tree in the front yard at 100

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.130 
top of it tree in the front yard at 100
yards<00:04:23.320> camera<00:04:24.190> let's<00:04:24.340> see<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> tree<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.990> is

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
yards camera let's see the tree here is

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.820 
yards camera let's see the tree here is
the<00:04:26.320> i6<00:04:27.120> there<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.600> tree<00:04:28.870> obviously<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
the i6 there is the tree obviously the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.410 
the i6 there is the tree obviously the
house<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:30.220> fine<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:30.970> top<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
house is just fine but the top of the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.510 
house is just fine but the top of the
tree<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:32.320> actually<00:04:32.620> over<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.920> hundred<00:04:33.280> yards

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
tree is actually over a hundred yards

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.740 
tree is actually over a hundred yards
away<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:34.030> can<00:04:34.150> see<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.360> lights<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.630> up

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
away you can see it lights it up

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.110

inexpensive compact light performs
really<00:04:46.840> really<00:04:47.140> well<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.560> on<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.370> lower<00:04:48.550> mode

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
really really well and on the lower mode

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.930 
really really well and on the lower mode
you<00:04:49.240> can<00:04:49.330> see<00:04:49.450> out<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.600> 50<00:04:50.140> yards<00:04:50.530> no<00:04:51.280> problem

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
you can see out of 50 yards no problem

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.430 
you can see out of 50 yards no problem
how<00:04:52.390> your<00:04:52.540> yard<00:04:52.720> doesn't<00:04:53.020> really<00:04:53.140> do<00:04:53.290> all<00:04:53.410> that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
how your yard doesn't really do all that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.990 
how your yard doesn't really do all that
great<00:04:53.650> but<00:04:53.980> that's<00:04:54.130> when<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.370> bump<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.700> up<00:04:54.760> to

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
great but that's when you bump it up to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.960 
great but that's when you bump it up to
the<00:04:55.390> higher<00:04:55.600> mode<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:57.250> there<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.490> go<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.940> is

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
the higher mode so there you go that is

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.050 
the higher mode so there you go that is
the<00:04:58.420> O<00:04:58.450> light<00:04:58.900> i6<00:04:59.620> paladin<00:05:00.190> if<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.700> like<00:05:00.880> it
