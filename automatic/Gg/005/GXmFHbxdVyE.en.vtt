00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
plushie just like this I've created a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.610 
plushie just like this I've created a
pattern<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.059> how<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> did<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> looked

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
pattern and how I did that was I looked

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.940 
pattern and how I did that was I looked
at<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> picture<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.639> bunny<00:00:12.120> peeps<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.710> did

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
at a picture of a bunny peeps and I did

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
at a picture of a bunny peeps and I did
an<00:00:14.309> error<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.790> folded<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> half<00:00:15.690> created

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
an error I folded this in half created

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.670 
an error I folded this in half created
an<00:00:16.350> ear<00:00:16.590> cut<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.070> out<00:00:18.109> traced<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> did

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
an ear cut it out traced it and did

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.340 
an ear cut it out traced it and did
another<00:00:19.890> ear<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.490> would<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> same

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
another ear so they would be the same

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
another ear so they would be the same
folded<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.769> half<00:00:23.010> didn't<00:00:23.760> oval<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.449> then

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
folded this in half didn't oval and then

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
folded this in half didn't oval and then
this<00:00:25.170> took<00:00:26.090> two<00:00:27.090> sheets<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.720> able<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> do

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this took two sheets to be able to do

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
this took two sheets to be able to do
that<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.220> simple<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.240> looked

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that so it was very simple I just looked

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.179 
that so it was very simple I just looked
at<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> picture<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.410> looked<00:00:31.590> at<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> different

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
at a picture and looked at the different

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
at a picture and looked at the different
shapes<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:33.030> come<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.630> pattern<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
shapes to come up with this pattern so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.470 
shapes to come up with this pattern so
it's<00:00:34.829> probably<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.190> perfect<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's probably not perfect but it's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's probably not perfect but it's
certainly<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.200> good<00:00:37.410> enough<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> get

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
certainly gonna be good enough to get

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
certainly gonna be good enough to get
the<00:00:37.920> idea<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> shape<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> pink<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the idea for the shape of the pink and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.470 
the idea for the shape of the pink and
the<00:00:40.620> final<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.190> need<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the final thing I need to do on this is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
the final thing I need to do on this is
just<00:00:42.690> tape<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> together<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.829> not

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
just tape it together if you're not

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
just tape it together if you're not
