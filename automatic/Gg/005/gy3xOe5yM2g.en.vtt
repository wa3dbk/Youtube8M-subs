everything and then we coming over to
the<00:01:19.810> ship<00:01:20.050> shooter<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:22.119> like<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.710> of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
the ship shooter I just like a kind of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.990 
the ship shooter I just like a kind of
automatic<00:01:24.490> gun<00:01:24.759> for<00:01:25.720> USB<00:01:26.410> sticks<00:01:26.830> now<00:01:27.729> just

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
automatic gun for USB sticks now just

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.700 
automatic gun for USB sticks now just
getting<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> ships<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.810> there<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:35.410> next

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
getting the ships on there and the next

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.050 
getting the ships on there and the next
step<00:01:35.920> would<00:01:36.369> be<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:39.190> icy<00:01:39.610> mound<00:01:39.850> er<00:01:42.060> where

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
step would be the icy mound er where

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.109 
step would be the icy mound er where
they're<00:01:43.470> getting<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.680> connectors<00:01:45.369> on<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
they're getting the connectors on the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:54.270 
they're getting the connectors on the
USB<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.560> ICS<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:50.580> then<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.950> what

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
USB and the ICS and then just just what

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.399 
USB and the ICS and then just just what
i<00:01:54.310> would<00:01:54.670> love<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.880> point<00:01:55.330> out<00:01:55.509> over<00:01:55.869> here<00:01:56.140> you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
i would love to point out over here you

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.410 
i would love to point out over here you
can<00:01:56.590> also<00:01:56.860> see<00:01:57.220> all<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.549> time<00:01:57.820> which<00:01:58.030> kind<00:01:58.330> of

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
can also see all the time which kind of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.420 
can also see all the time which kind of
model<00:01:58.810> which<00:01:59.380> kind<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.770> layout<00:01:59.979> they<00:02:00.369> are

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
model which kind of layout they are

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.340 
model which kind of layout they are
having<00:02:00.880> right<00:02:00.909> there<00:02:01.270> receiving<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.080> from<00:02:02.320> a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
having right there receiving this from a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.010 
having right there receiving this from a
central<00:02:03.310> database<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:04.570> getting<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.990> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
central database it's getting to the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.020 
central database it's getting to the
different<00:02:05.710> production<00:02:06.220> line<00:02:06.400> so<00:02:06.760> they<00:02:06.850> can

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
different production line so they can

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.000 
different production line so they can
always<00:02:07.180> see<00:02:07.479> ok<00:02:07.780> when<00:02:08.590> they're<00:02:08.709> coming<00:02:08.950> up

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
always see ok when they're coming up

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.699 
always see ok when they're coming up
with<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> new<00:02:09.489> model<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.570> can<00:02:10.780> update<00:02:11.019> this<00:02:11.470> on

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
with a new model they can update this on

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.860 
with a new model they can update this on
this<00:02:11.890> computer<00:02:12.700> over<00:02:13.269> here<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.720> it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
this computer over here and then it's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.210 
this computer over here and then it's
finally<00:02:17.320> getting<00:02:17.500> into<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> oven<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.890> mean

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
finally getting into the oven so I mean

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.630 
finally getting into the oven so I mean
all<00:02:21.690> these<00:02:23.310> solos<00:02:24.310> pace<00:02:25.269> needs<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.900> get<00:02:26.140> sealed

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
all these solos pace needs to get sealed

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.940 
all these solos pace needs to get sealed
on<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.269> USB<00:02:29.280> stick<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.170> huge

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
on the USB stick and so this is a huge

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.970 
on the USB stick and so this is a huge
huge<00:02:33.519> oven<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.690> takes<00:02:34.930> about<00:02:35.079> five<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.769> six

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
huge oven and it takes about five to six

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.720 
huge oven and it takes about five to six
minutes<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.730> seal<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> they're<00:02:39.190> running

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
minutes to seal it so they're running

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.340 
minutes to seal it so they're running
through<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.090> what<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.549> 10<00:02:42.549> feet

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
through this what is it like 10 feet

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.990 
through this what is it like 10 feet
something<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.829> 10<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.370> 12<00:02:45.670> feet<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
something like this 10 to 12 feet of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.090 
something like this 10 to 12 feet of
them<00:02:47.970> finally<00:02:48.970> coming<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:50.769> kind<00:02:51.040> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
them finally coming to kind of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.240 
them finally coming to kind of
in-between<00:02:51.340> step<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:54.180> getting<00:02:55.180> out<00:02:55.329> of<00:02:55.510> here

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
in-between step but getting out of here

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.520 
in-between step but getting out of here
getting<00:02:57.250> we<00:02:57.579> arranged<00:02:58.209> we<00:02:58.390> packed<00:02:58.750> into<00:02:59.110> new

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.910 

to<00:03:03.180> finally<00:03:04.519> then<00:03:05.519> go<00:03:05.909> into<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:09.389> our

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
to finally then go into the our

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.300 
to finally then go into the our
so-called<00:03:12.739> Aoi<00:03:14.599> so<00:03:15.599> that's<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.560> auto<00:03:16.739> medical

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
so-called Aoi so that's the auto medical

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
so-called Aoi so that's the auto medical
optical<00:03:18.150> inspection<00:03:20.090> which<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.389> final

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
optical inspection which is the final

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.970 
optical inspection which is the final
check<00:03:23.480> for<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.599> USB<00:03:25.049> sticks<00:03:27.230> before<00:03:28.230> their

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.869 

before<00:03:31.980> they're<00:03:32.129> getting<00:03:32.489> into<00:03:32.730> their

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
before they're getting into their

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.690 
before they're getting into their
package<00:03:33.359> right<00:03:33.599> now<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:34.340> which<00:03:35.340> would<00:03:35.549> be<00:03:35.669> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
package right now right which would be a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.770 
package right now right which would be a
different<00:03:35.969> machine<00:03:36.329> there<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.430> we<00:03:39.359> just<00:03:39.599> got

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
different machine there so we just got

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.229 
different machine there so we just got
one<00:03:40.019> floor<00:03:40.349> up<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.949> to<00:03:41.519> go<00:03:41.699> to<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.060> next

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
one floor up and to go to the next

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.890 
one floor up and to go to the next
production<00:03:42.629> step<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.469> USB<00:03:43.739> stick<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.030> here

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
production step of the USB stick so here

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.179 
production step of the USB stick so here
you<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.019> see<00:03:46.230> these<00:03:46.680> magazines<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.819> came

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
you can see these magazines that came

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.800 
you can see these magazines that came
out<00:03:50.189> of<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.430> production<00:03:50.909> line<00:03:51.329> where<00:03:51.510> we<00:03:51.569> saw

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
out of this production line where we saw

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.319 
out of this production line where we saw
everything<00:03:52.139> I<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> solder<00:03:53.430> pass<00:03:53.669> printing

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
everything I was a solder pass printing

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.300 
everything I was a solder pass printing
and<00:03:54.659> how<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:55.049> got<00:03:55.169> sealed<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.889> everything

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
and how they got sealed and everything

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.170 
and how they got sealed and everything
but<00:03:56.669> remember<00:03:57.449> we<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:57.989> still<00:03:58.439> you<00:03:59.189> know<00:03:59.310> they

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
but remember we have still you know they

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.050 
but remember we have still you know they
need<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.659> cut<00:04:00.989> because<00:04:01.699> we<00:04:02.699> have<00:04:02.849> like

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
need to get cut because we have like

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.619 
need to get cut because we have like
like<00:04:03.449> like<00:04:03.629> two<00:04:04.669> USB<00:04:05.669> sticks<00:04:05.969> or<00:04:06.120> two<00:04:06.269> devices

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
like like two USB sticks or two devices

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.800 
like like two USB sticks or two devices
on<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.259> one<00:04:07.799> SMG<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.639> they're<00:04:09.359> getting<00:04:09.659> into

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
on just one SMG so they're getting into

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.110 
on just one SMG so they're getting into
this<00:04:10.079> machine<00:04:10.919> over<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:11.699> with<00:04:11.970> these

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
this machine over here with these

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.699 
this machine over here with these
magazines<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.099> then<00:04:14.099> they're<00:04:15.289> getting<00:04:16.289> cut

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
magazines and then they're getting cut

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.349 
magazines and then they're getting cut
by<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:17.009> little<00:04:17.810> what<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.169> any<00:04:19.680> kind<00:04:20.220> of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
it when you look down there you would

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.060 
it when you look down there you would
see<00:04:32.580> how<00:04:33.570> it's<00:04:33.810> getting<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:34.440> cut<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.830> half

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
see how it's getting just cut in half

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.230 
see how it's getting just cut in half
and<00:04:35.509> then<00:04:36.509> coming<00:04:36.960> back<00:04:36.990> are<00:04:39.020> taking<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.110> over

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
and then coming back are taking it over

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.980 
and then coming back are taking it over
to<00:04:42.240> finally<00:04:43.190> get<00:04:44.190> rid<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.520> all<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.360> extra

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
to finally get rid of all the extra

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.339 
to finally get rid of all the extra
stuff<00:04:46.610> around<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.780> producing<00:04:49.169> a

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
stuff around it so it's producing a

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.950 
stuff around it so it's producing a
little<00:04:49.560> bit<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.740> garbage<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.570> know<00:04:51.719> oh

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
little bit of garbage and you know oh

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.969 
little bit of garbage and you know oh
they're<00:04:52.440> finally<00:04:52.979> we<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.520> single

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
they're finally we have the single

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.770 
they're finally we have the single
versus<00:04:55.979> of<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.250> USB<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.880> course<00:04:57.210> without<00:04:57.479> the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
versus of the USB of course without the

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.740 
versus of the USB of course without the
packaging<00:04:58.320> because<00:04:59.039> that<00:04:59.669> would<00:04:59.849> be<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.449> next

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
packaging because that would be the next

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.920 
packaging because that would be the next
step<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:02.610> actually<00:05:02.849> after<00:05:03.479> we've<00:05:03.630> been

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
step so actually after we've been

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.950

so<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.870> would<00:05:16.260> still<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.470> some<00:05:16.620> five<00:05:16.830> minutes

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
so I would still have some five minutes

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.250 
so I would still have some five minutes
left<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:17.550> one<00:05:17.820> so<00:05:18.000> let's<00:05:18.120> just<00:05:18.900> get

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
left on this one so let's just get

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.440 
left on this one so let's just get
quickly<00:05:19.650> over<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.340> machine<00:05:20.550> which<00:05:21.330> is

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
quickly over to this machine which is

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.440 
quickly over to this machine which is
actually<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:22.110> kind<00:05:22.410> of<00:05:22.710> testing<00:05:23.580> process<00:05:24.120> over

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
actually a kind of testing process over

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.720 
actually a kind of testing process over
here<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.320> they're<00:05:25.470> just<00:05:25.680> doing<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:26.010> read<00:05:26.520> and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
here so they're just doing a read and

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.570 
here so they're just doing a read and
rewrite<00:05:27.210> our<00:05:27.980> operation<00:05:28.980> into<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.370> memory

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
rewrite our operation into the memory

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.460 
rewrite our operation into the memory
just<00:05:30.240> checking<00:05:30.600> if<00:05:30.690> everything<00:05:31.110> works<00:05:31.320> out

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
just checking if everything works out

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.940 
just checking if everything works out
properly<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.420> yeah<00:05:33.420> so<00:05:34.050> it's<00:05:34.230> more<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.500> kind<00:05:34.800> of

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
properly and yeah so it's more a kind of

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.140 
properly and yeah so it's more a kind of
testing<00:05:35.340> process<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> after<00:05:38.880> we<00:05:38.970> did<00:05:39.120> the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
testing process so after we did the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.050 
testing process so after we did the
function<00:05:39.630> test<00:05:39.870> at<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.290> machine<00:05:40.740> are

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
function test at this machine are

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.240 
function test at this machine are
finally<00:05:42.060> as<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.660> know<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:43.050> mean<00:05:43.230> you<00:05:43.590> can<00:05:43.830> sell

these<00:05:44.400> USB<00:05:44.760> sticks<00:05:45.330> like<00:05:45.540> this<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:46.110> know<00:05:46.260> we

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
these USB sticks like this you know we

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.510 
these USB sticks like this you know we
need<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.710> get<00:05:46.890> some<00:05:47.250> casing<00:05:48.150> around<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.720> and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
need to get some casing around it and

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.420 
need to get some casing around it and
that's<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.670> little<00:05:50.850> machine<00:05:51.090> over<00:05:51.570> here

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
that's this little machine over here

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.260 
that's this little machine over here
it's<00:05:53.430> doing<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:54.120> top<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:54.930> bottom<00:05:54.960> casing

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
it's doing the top and the bottom casing

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.080 
it's doing the top and the bottom casing
so<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.360> can<00:05:57.660> see<00:05:57.930> these<00:05:58.170> fancy<00:05:58.650> colors<00:05:59.070> and<00:05:59.580> of

so you can see these fancy colors and of

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.810 
so you can see these fancy colors and of
course<00:06:00.870> they<00:06:01.020> are<00:06:01.110> all<00:06:01.290> kind<00:06:01.620> of<00:06:01.740> different

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
course they are all kind of different

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.880 
course they are all kind of different
casing<00:06:02.820> I'm<00:06:03.060> pretty<00:06:03.750> sure<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.050> kinks<00:06:04.470> is<00:06:04.590> also

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
casing I'm pretty sure the kinks is also

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.670 
casing I'm pretty sure the kinks is also
doing<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.220> lot<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.430> odm<00:06:06.060> casing<00:06:06.840> or<00:06:07.050> you<00:06:07.620> know

doing a lot of odm casing or you know
customized<00:06:08.340> versions<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:10.520> after<00:06:11.520> they

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
customized versions of it and after they

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.620 
customized versions of it and after they
got<00:06:12.000> into<00:06:12.270> this<00:06:12.510> case<00:06:13.040> we<00:06:14.040> are<00:06:14.130> finally<00:06:14.670> coming

got into this case we are finally coming
to<00:06:16.190> a<00:06:17.190> kind<00:06:17.970> of<00:06:18.210> final<00:06:18.780> function<00:06:19.590> test<00:06:20.130> which

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
to a kind of final function test which

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.480 
to a kind of final function test which
is<00:06:21.120> happening<00:06:21.450> over<00:06:21.990> here<00:06:22.020> you<00:06:22.350> see<00:06:22.590> the<00:06:22.620> lot

is happening over here you see the lot

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.670 
is happening over here you see the lot
of<00:06:23.640> tests<00:06:24.120> going<00:06:24.330> on<00:06:24.600> between<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:25.200> different

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
of tests going on between the different

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.180 
of tests going on between the different
work<00:06:25.890> steps<00:06:26.540> so<00:06:27.540> Kingston<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.110> really<00:06:28.500> making

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190

old-fashioned manufacturing hand work so
you<00:07:00.300> can<00:07:00.540> see<00:07:00.810> these<00:07:00.960> fellas<00:07:01.350> over<00:07:01.500> here<00:07:01.830> just

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
you can see these fellas over here just

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.240 
you can see these fellas over here just
getting<00:07:02.910> the<00:07:03.630> stickers<00:07:04.080> on<00:07:04.290> there<00:07:04.530> on<00:07:04.740> the

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
getting the stickers on there on the

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.380 
getting the stickers on there on the
back<00:07:05.430> side<00:07:05.730> of<00:07:05.790> the<00:07:06.570> kingston<00:07:06.990> USB<00:07:07.170> stick<00:07:07.740> and

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
back side of the kingston USB stick and

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.540 
back side of the kingston USB stick and
this<00:07:09.390> is<00:07:09.600> then<00:07:09.930> definitely<00:07:10.620> the<00:07:11.070> final<00:07:11.340> step

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
this is then definitely the final step

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:48.540 
this is then definitely the final step
before<00:07:12.320> we're<00:07:13.320> going<00:07:13.560> into<00:07:13.800> the<00:07:13.950> packaging

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.740 

so<00:07:49.550> in<00:07:49.639> the<00:07:49.729> final<00:07:50.030> stage<00:07:50.210> here<00:07:50.419> you<00:07:50.479> can<00:07:50.629> see

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:50.750 
so in the final stage here you can see

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.809 
so in the final stage here you can see
they're<00:07:50.900> manually<00:07:51.259> put<00:07:51.439> into<00:07:51.620> boxes<00:07:52.039> of<00:07:52.340> the

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:52.819 
they're manually put into boxes of the

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:55.360 
they're manually put into boxes of the
account<00:07:53.210> out
