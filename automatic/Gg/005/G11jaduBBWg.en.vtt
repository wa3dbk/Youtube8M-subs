one<00:00:04.240> other<00:00:04.510> variation<00:00:04.870> I'd<00:00:05.440> like<00:00:05.649> to<00:00:05.800> very

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
one other variation I'd like to very

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.420 
one other variation I'd like to very
quickly<00:00:06.310> share<00:00:06.700> with<00:00:06.970> you<00:00:07.240> is<00:00:08.100> this<00:00:09.100> leaf

right<00:00:09.610> here<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:11.980> did<00:00:12.369> to<00:00:12.580> achieve<00:00:12.699> this

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
right here what I did to achieve this

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.130 
right here what I did to achieve this
shaded<00:00:14.049> effect<00:00:14.760> I'm<00:00:15.760> not<00:00:16.029> sure<00:00:16.299> it<00:00:16.480> shows<00:00:16.840> very

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
shaded effect I'm not sure it shows very

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.070 
shaded effect I'm not sure it shows very
well<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:19.240> I<00:00:19.660> mixed<00:00:20.259> in<00:00:20.439> one<00:00:20.679> cup<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:23.429> 50/50

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

light<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.410> dark<00:00:26.619> green<00:00:26.890> beads<00:00:27.249> and<00:00:27.640> then

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
light and dark green beads and then

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.950 
light and dark green beads and then
simply<00:00:28.539> randomly<00:00:29.019> strung<00:00:29.499> them<00:00:29.650> together

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
simply randomly strung them together

that<00:00:31.960> effect<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:34.270> design<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.960> also<00:00:35.199> very

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
that effect in a design is also very

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.130 
that effect in a design is also very
elegant<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:37.000> just<00:00:37.210> one<00:00:37.390> other<00:00:37.570> option<00:00:38.110> you

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
elegant it's just one other option you

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.290 
elegant it's just one other option you
have<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.440> design<00:00:42.340> for<00:00:42.789> this<00:00:42.969> leaf

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
have there now the design for this leaf

that<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:44.140> just<00:00:44.170> we<00:00:44.739> just<00:00:45.340> made<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.190> many

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
that we we just we just made has so many

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.299 
that we we just we just made has so many
applications<00:00:48.609> as<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.629> recall<00:00:50.289> when<00:00:51.280> we

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
applications as you recall when we

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.689 
applications as you recall when we
brought<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:52.030> wrap<00:00:52.239> up<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.649> first<00:00:53.890> time<00:00:54.280> and

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
brought the wrap up the first time and

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.200 
brought the wrap up the first time and
we<00:00:55.269> wrapped<00:00:55.539> it<00:00:55.750> around<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.590> then<00:00:57.179> came<00:00:58.179> back

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
we wrapped it around and then came back

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.349 
we wrapped it around and then came back
down<00:00:58.660> we<00:00:59.079> did<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.500> as<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.699> 45-degree<00:01:00.699> angle<00:01:00.730> up

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
down we did this as a 45-degree angle up

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.020 
down we did this as a 45-degree angle up
wrapped<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.350> around<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.949> then<00:01:03.460> came<00:01:03.730> right

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
wrapped it around and then came right

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.870 
wrapped it around and then came right
down<00:01:04.059> with<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.410> that<00:01:05.440> 45<00:01:06.160> degree<00:01:06.310> angle

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
I use 15 odd sized glass beads in this

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.940 
I use 15 odd sized glass beads in this
one<00:02:28.620> instead<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.159> 11<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.969> and<00:02:30.379> sometimes<00:02:31.379> those

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
one instead of 11 on and sometimes those

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.360 
one instead of 11 on and sometimes those
little<00:02:32.489> tiny<00:02:32.760> 50-knot<00:02:33.599> beads<00:02:34.010> give<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> very

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
little tiny 50-knot beads give a very

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.819 
little tiny 50-knot beads give a very
very<00:02:35.519> elegant<00:02:36.299> look<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:37.319> cannot<00:02:37.769> be

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
very elegant look that cannot be

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.610 
very elegant look that cannot be
achieved<00:02:38.370> with<00:02:38.609> an<00:02:38.730> eleven<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.409> so<00:02:40.409> that's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
achieved with an eleven on so that's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.009 
achieved with an eleven on so that's
another<00:02:40.980> consideration<00:02:41.569> when<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.689> start

another consideration when you start

in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> center<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.560> graduate<00:02:56.219> them<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.639> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
in the center and graduate them out that

would<00:02:57.659> be<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> whole<00:02:58.049> different<00:02:58.079> tutorial<00:02:59.040> if

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
would be a whole different tutorial if

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.860 
would be a whole different tutorial if
you<00:02:59.310> want<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.579> get<00:02:59.730> into<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.120> let<00:03:00.540> me<00:03:00.569> know

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
you want to get into that let me know

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.069 
you want to get into that let me know
and<00:03:01.049> I'll<00:03:01.169> do<00:03:01.379> roses<00:03:01.799> with<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.239> but<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
and I'll do roses with you but the

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.039 
and I'll do roses with you but the
basics<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.010> same<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.180> there's

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
basics are the same there are there's

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.020 
basics are the same there are there's
one<00:03:07.889> tiny<00:03:08.549> petal<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.299> center<00:03:09.859> three

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
one tiny petal in the center three

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.300 
one tiny petal in the center three
slightly<00:03:12.030> larger<00:03:12.419> petals<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.709> then<00:03:13.949> five

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
slightly larger petals and then five

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.649 
slightly larger petals and then five
nineteen<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.900> five<00:03:16.940> larger<00:03:17.940> petals<00:03:18.299> on

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
nineteen you know five larger petals on

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.809 
nineteen you know five larger petals on
the<00:03:18.840> perimeter<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:20.069> creates<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.639> really

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
the perimeter and that creates a really

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.879 
the perimeter and that creates a really
nice<00:03:21.090> full<00:03:21.629> red<00:03:22.560> rose<00:03:23.780> but<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.439> pedal

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
nice full red rose but the the pedal

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.149 
nice full red rose but the the pedal
each<00:03:26.310> petal<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.090> made<00:03:27.389> exactly<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:28.049> way<00:03:28.319> we

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
each petal is made exactly the way we

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.030 
each petal is made exactly the way we
made<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.579> leaf<00:03:29.909> and<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.590> they're<00:03:31.829> all

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
made this leaf and then they're all

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.830 
made this leaf and then they're all
brought<00:03:32.400> together<00:03:32.639> in<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> center<00:03:34.639> and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
brought together in the center and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.860 
brought together in the center and
they're<00:03:36.840> wrapped<00:03:37.169> with<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.099> floral<00:03:38.639> tape<00:03:39.299> in

they're wrapped with a floral tape in

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.920 
they're wrapped with a floral tape in
green<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:41.489> later<00:03:41.939> when<00:03:42.209> I'm<00:03:42.329> ready<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.750> use

green and later when I'm ready to use
them<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.259> composition<00:03:43.849> I'll<00:03:44.849> either<00:03:45.150> wrap

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
them in a composition I'll either wrap

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.999 
them in a composition I'll either wrap
them<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:45.900> silk<00:03:46.859> or<00:03:47.639> embroidery<00:03:48.509> floss<00:03:49.009> or

them with silk or embroidery floss or
glass<00:03:50.310> beads<00:03:50.759> I<00:03:51.150> don't<00:03:52.049> really<00:03:52.229> care<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.620> a

glass beads I don't really care for a

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.240 
glass beads I don't really care for a
final<00:03:53.400> finish<00:03:53.939> in<00:03:54.180> floral<00:03:55.049> tape<00:03:55.349> but<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.859> is

final finish in floral tape but it is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210 
final finish in floral tape but it is
widely<00:03:56.669> accepted<00:03:57.409> and<00:03:58.409> I'm<00:03:58.680> not<00:03:58.979> criticizing

widely accepted and I'm not criticizing

widely accepted and I'm not criticizing
that<00:03:59.849> I'm<00:04:00.090> just<00:04:00.419> saying<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:00.810> for<00:04:01.019> my

that I'm just saying that for my

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
personal taste I don't care for this

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.710 
personal taste I don't care for this
finish<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.560> I'll<00:04:04.769> tell<00:04:04.979> you<00:04:05.129> what<00:04:05.720> because

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
finish and I'll tell you what because

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.740 
finish and I'll tell you what because
this<00:04:07.199> tape<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:08.159> coated<00:04:08.699> in<00:04:08.819> wax<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.449> that's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
this tape is coated in wax and that's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.640 
this tape is coated in wax and that's
what<00:04:09.959> makes<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.379> hold<00:04:11.209> together<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.500> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
what makes it hold together and and it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.460 
what makes it hold together and and it
helps<00:04:14.040> contain<00:04:14.459> all<00:04:14.639> of<00:04:14.790> these<00:04:14.939> fine<00:04:15.239> wires<00:04:15.629> so

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
helps contain all of these fine wires so

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.599 
helps contain all of these fine wires so
that<00:04:16.620> they<00:04:16.769> can<00:04:16.919> be<00:04:17.039> finished<00:04:17.370> more

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
that they can be finished more

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.819 
that they can be finished more
beautifully<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> smooths<00:04:18.779> everything<00:04:19.260> down

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
beautifully it smooths everything down

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.099 
beautifully it smooths everything down
and<00:04:20.039> gives<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.279> a<00:04:20.310> nice<00:04:20.459> smooth<00:04:20.909> surface<00:04:21.209> to

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
and gives you a nice smooth surface to

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.019 
and gives you a nice smooth surface to
apply<00:04:22.349> your<00:04:22.529> floss<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.190> your<00:04:23.310> silk<00:04:23.580> or<00:04:23.880> your

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:24.029 
apply your floss and your silk or your

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.260 
apply your floss and your silk or your
beads<00:04:24.650> but<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:25.800> tacky<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.880> don't<00:04:26.969> mean

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
beads but it's tacky and I don't mean

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.140 
beads but it's tacky and I don't mean
tacky<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.830> an<00:04:29.430> unattractive

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
tacky and as an unattractive

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.279 
tacky and as an unattractive
I<00:04:30.300> mean<00:04:30.510> tactilely<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:32.219> is<00:04:32.639> tacky<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.960> when

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
I mean tactilely it is tacky the when

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.600 
I mean tactilely it is tacky the when
the<00:04:34.430> wax<00:04:35.430> gets<00:04:35.880> warm<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:37.139> feels<00:04:37.560> sticky<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.520> I

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
the wax gets warm it feels sticky and I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.950 
the wax gets warm it feels sticky and I
don't<00:04:38.669> like<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.300> way<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.659> feels<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:42.449> I

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
don't like the way that feels and I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.409 
don't like the way that feels and I
don't<00:04:43.409> think<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.949> this<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.460> durable<00:04:45.150> enough

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
don't think that this is durable enough

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.159
