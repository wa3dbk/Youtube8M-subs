leopard had had watched it and had
figured<00:01:45.859> this<00:01:46.130> out<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:46.880> had<00:01:47.060> approached

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
figured this out and so had approached

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.989 
figured this out and so had approached
in<00:01:47.689> one<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.350> two<00:01:48.560> soft<00:01:48.889> spots<00:01:49.189> on<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.399> hippo<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
the hippos have incredibly sick hides so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.739 
the hippos have incredibly sick hides so
they're<00:01:52.549> they're<00:01:52.909> almost<00:01:53.030> bullet<00:01:53.569> proof

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
they're they're almost bullet proof

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.530 
they're they're almost bullet proof
within<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:54.319> animal<00:01:54.619> kingdom

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
within the animal kingdom

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.530 
within the animal kingdom

is underneath the neck and the other is
right<00:02:00.430> underneath<00:02:00.730> its<00:02:01.060> tail<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
right underneath its tail and so the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.960 
right underneath its tail and so the
leopard<00:02:02.740> had<00:02:02.920> gone<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.610> figured<00:02:03.880> out

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
leopard had gone in and figured out

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.460 
leopard had gone in and figured out
where<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.480> range<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.810> motion<00:02:04.930> was<00:02:05.230> for<00:02:05.410> this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
where the range of motion was for this

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.100 
where the range of motion was for this
hippo<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:05.950> had<00:02:06.070> started<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.610> feed<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.420> this

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
hippo and had started to feed on this

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.800 
hippo and had started to feed on this
hippo<00:02:08.470> underneath<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> pail<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:10.119> hyena

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
hippo underneath the pail the hyena

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.200 
hippo underneath the pail the hyena
zeroed<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.890> point<00:02:12.130> where<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
zeroed in on the point where the the the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.540 
zeroed in on the point where the the the
leopard<00:02:13.360> had<00:02:13.690> opened<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.440> hippo<00:02:14.710> up<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.070> then

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
leopard had opened the hippo up and then

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.890 
leopard had opened the hippo up and then
they<00:02:15.730> began<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.090> feed<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
they began to feed and that's the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.170 
they began to feed and that's the
footage<00:02:17.170> you're<00:02:17.320> seeing<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.490> was<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.030> was

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
footage you're seeing and it was it was

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.270 
footage you're seeing and it was it was
really<00:02:19.600> rough<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.530> first<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.130> thought

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
really rough because at first we thought

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.830 
really rough because at first we thought
the<00:02:21.460> hippo<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.820> probably<00:02:22.090> paralyzed<00:02:22.600> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the hippo was probably paralyzed and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.410 
the hippo was probably paralyzed and
hopefully<00:02:23.140> couldn't<00:02:23.440> feel<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:25.090> didn't

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
hopefully couldn't feel it it didn't

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.970 
hopefully couldn't feel it it didn't
make<00:02:25.510> any<00:02:25.570> sounds<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.350> didn't<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:26.620> any<00:02:26.800> noise

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
make any sounds it didn't make any noise

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.699 
make any sounds it didn't make any noise
but<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.910> as<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.270> see<00:02:28.330> at<00:02:29.050> one<00:02:29.320> point<00:02:29.500> it

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
but but as you can see at one point it

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.620 
but but as you can see at one point it
does<00:02:30.100> end<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.850> standing<00:02:31.330> up<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
does end up actually standing up in

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440 
does end up actually standing up in
response<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> well<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.880> hard<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> know<00:02:34.270> how

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
response so well it's hard to know how

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.710 
response so well it's hard to know how
much<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.780> was<00:02:34.870> feeling<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.730> does<00:02:37.000> look<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.450> it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
much it was feeling it does look like it

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320 
much it was feeling it does look like it
was<00:02:37.870> probably<00:02:38.290> suffering<00:02:38.830> some<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.370> from

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
was probably suffering some and from

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.050 
was probably suffering some and from
from<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.410> humanistic<00:02:42.130> standpoint<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.030> really

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
from a humanistic standpoint you really

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.360 
from a humanistic standpoint you really
you<00:02:43.570> feel<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.170> need<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.560> step<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:45.040> like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you feel like you need to step in like

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.010 
you feel like you need to step in like
you<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.970> hippo<00:02:46.270> obviously<00:02:46.750> isn't

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
you know this hippo obviously isn't

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.140 
you know this hippo obviously isn't
going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> survive<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.489> shoot<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.060> we

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
going to survive can we shoot it can we

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.410 
going to survive can we shoot it can we
do<00:02:49.330> something<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.910> difficult

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
do something and the the the difficult

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
do something and the the the difficult
reality<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.290> you're<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.580> you're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
reality is that you're there and you're

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.729 
reality is that you're there and you're
not<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.600> not<00:02:55.750> allowed<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.140> interfere<00:02:56.350> in

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
not you're not allowed to interfere in

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.140 
not you're not allowed to interfere in
any<00:02:56.890> way<00:02:56.950> shape<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.400> form<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:57.970> that's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
any way shape or form and that that's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.750 
any way shape or form and that that's
the<00:02:58.330> right<00:02:58.510> course<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.959> action<00:02:59.350> but<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.489> really

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the right course of action but it really

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.120 
the right course of action but it really
makes<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.239> much<00:03:01.360> more<00:03:01.420> difficult<00:03:02.130> now

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
makes it that much more difficult now

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.830 
makes it that much more difficult now
the<00:03:03.190> upside<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.880> really<00:03:04.090> kind<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.300> offset

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the upside that really kind of offset

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.680 
the upside that really kind of offset
that<00:03:05.080> difficult<00:03:05.650> experience<00:03:06.580> was<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.330> over

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
that difficult experience was that over

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.540 
that difficult experience was that over
the<00:03:07.780> following<00:03:07.989> two<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> half<00:03:08.890> days<00:03:09.190> we

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
the following two and a half days we

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.130 
the following two and a half days we
watched<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.090> circle<00:03:10.480> live<00:03:10.660> come<00:03:10.900> full<00:03:11.110> circle

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
watched the circle live come full circle

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.600 
watched the circle live come full circle
so<00:03:12.450> luckily<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.320> hippo<00:03:14.680> was<00:03:14.860> dead<00:03:15.310> by<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
so luckily the hippo was dead by the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.580 
so luckily the hippo was dead by the
following<00:03:16.090> morning<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.600> hopefully<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.500> had

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
following morning and hopefully it had

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.030 
following morning and hopefully it had
bled<00:03:17.830> out<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.150> died<00:03:19.150> fairly<00:03:19.510> quickly<00:03:20.040> but

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
bled out and died fairly quickly but

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.770 
bled out and died fairly quickly but
when<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.280> circled<00:03:21.640> back<00:03:21.760> around<00:03:21.820> we<00:03:22.510> saw<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
when we circled back around we saw the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.479 
when we circled back around we saw the
hyenas<00:03:23.560> starting<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> feed<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.310> they<00:03:24.370> would

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
hyenas starting to feed and they would

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.190 
hyenas starting to feed and they would
eat<00:03:24.670> until<00:03:24.850> they<00:03:25.090> were<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.450> fat<00:03:25.810> they<00:03:25.989> looked

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
eat until they were so fat they looked

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.530 
eat until they were so fat they looked
pregnant<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.769> can<00:03:26.890> barely<00:03:27.160> move<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.360> then

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
pregnant and can barely move and then

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.270 
pregnant and can barely move and then
the<00:03:28.630> vulture<00:03:29.019> started<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.440> move<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.010> I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
the vulture started to move in and I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.039 
the vulture started to move in and I
expected<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.820> corpse<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.299> stink<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.930> to

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
expected the corpse to stink and to

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.110 
expected the corpse to stink and to
start<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.860> rot<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.459> fester<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
start to or to rot and to fester and to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.780 
start to or to rot and to fester and to
be<00:03:34.269> there<00:03:34.450> for<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> long<00:03:34.870> period<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.260> time<00:03:35.790> but

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
be there for a long period of time but

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.729 
be there for a long period of time but
amazingly<00:03:37.420> within<00:03:37.780> about<00:03:38.110> two<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.590> half

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
amazingly within about two and a half

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.880 
amazingly within about two and a half
days<00:03:39.090> every<00:03:40.090> piece<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.260> tissue<00:03:41.440> had<00:03:41.739> been

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
days every piece of tissue had been
