00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.900
 wccf goal collection 8 this time I tried to say a voice like this 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.900
 I recently played wccf and saw that nostalgic shoot 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.900
 Atletico's moss is a brilliant loop shoot 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.100
 Hmmm 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.100
 The future Ruwuu 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.670
 This is completely a shot of Hokke 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.670
 5 minutes into the blue bird 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.790
 goo 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.790
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.880
 Huh struck the heart 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.910
 This is Re 's terrible smile also seen many times 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.910
 Hmm 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.070
 Hmmm I will not accept this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 Bread Caro's I'm laughs sum of the opposing team had scored a goal and one step missing kun by goals 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.890
 If you look in various ways 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.390
 I remembered that I used to not use as many goalkeepers as I used to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.390
 Miura look at this 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 bwh 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.670
 A collection of nba roms like a mocking of the top 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.540
 Teaching you what 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 me 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.670
 Ahho went XXX 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.670
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 000 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.920
 Then it was more likely than ever that the keeper was exchanged with every hand 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.760
 I did not see much the scene where the version upgrade is repeated and the keeper is exchanged 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.760
 But instead the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 It seems like it 's a jump of such timing 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 Behavior suspicious keeper we 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 Look at something like this loop shoot and look back at wccf 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 I remembered 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 Now I think it is Ne is Ne I want to be reluctant over Pis repair and complete Pu Netto 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.410
 This time the goal collection 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.410
 It became an extra edition Thank you for watching this time
