today is Sunday when I'm uploading this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.389 
today is Sunday when I'm uploading this
video<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:37.760> did<00:00:38.449> this<00:00:38.629> routine<00:00:38.989> yesterday<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.129> I

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
video I did this routine yesterday so I

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.250 
video I did this routine yesterday so I
started<00:00:40.760> off<00:00:40.909> with<00:00:41.059> some<00:00:41.300> forearm<00:00:41.809> work<00:00:42.019> for

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
started off with some forearm work for

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.680 
started off with some forearm work for
my<00:00:42.379> brachioradialis<00:00:42.800> because<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.030> tend<00:00:44.539> to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
my brachioradialis because I tend to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.059 
my brachioradialis because I tend to
forget<00:00:44.929> to<00:00:45.170> train<00:00:45.440> my<00:00:45.679> brachioradialis

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
forget to train my brachioradialis

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.819 
forget to train my brachioradialis
because<00:00:46.909> when<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.659> arms<00:00:47.989> get<00:00:48.199> bigger<00:00:48.530> bigger

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
because when the arms get bigger bigger

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.559 
because when the arms get bigger bigger
the<00:00:49.069> forearms<00:00:49.489> tend<00:00:49.729> to<00:00:49.850> look<00:00:49.999> smaller<00:00:50.329> if<00:00:50.539> you

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
the forearms tend to look smaller if you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.809 
the forearms tend to look smaller if you
don't<00:00:50.839> have<00:00:51.050> well-developed<00:00:51.440> forearms<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.789> I

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
don't have well-developed forearms so I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.559 
don't have well-developed forearms so I
did<00:00:53.179> some<00:00:53.449> overhand<00:00:54.019> grip<00:00:54.139> or<00:00:54.499> pronated<00:00:55.039> grip

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
happens is since your grip is overhand

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.309 
happens is since your grip is overhand
the<00:01:01.370> biceps<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:01.999> taken<00:01:02.420> out<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.569> the<00:01:02.839> way<00:01:03.019> and

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
does the majority of the work so then we

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.420

suppose<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.490> means<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:15.079> are<00:01:15.110> performing

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
suppose it means that you are performing

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.580 
suppose it means that you are performing
two<00:01:16.399> exercises<00:01:17.119> without<00:01:17.780> taking<00:01:18.170> rest<00:01:18.350> in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
two exercises without taking rest in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.340 
two exercises without taking rest in
between<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.219> that<00:01:19.789> counts<00:01:20.299> as<00:01:20.450> one<00:01:20.479> superset

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
between and that counts as one superset

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.319 
between and that counts as one superset
then<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.860> take<00:01:22.100> some<00:01:22.369> rest<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.789> then<00:01:22.850> start

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
then you take some rest and then start

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.300 
then you take some rest and then start
off<00:01:23.450> with<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.930> super<00:01:24.200> sets<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.009> did

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
off with the super sets so I did

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.740 
off with the super sets so I did
preacher<00:01:25.670> curls<00:01:26.090> with<00:01:26.359> EZ<00:01:26.539> bar<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.189> dips<00:01:28.750> in

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.569 
this first superset I didn't use
dumbbells<00:01:32.509> because<00:01:33.070> when<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.189> use<00:01:34.280> dumbbells

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
dumbbells because when you use dumbbells

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.209 
dumbbells because when you use dumbbells
you<00:01:35.450> have<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.719> do<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.020> single<00:01:36.259> arm<00:01:36.619> most<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.100> the

you have to do it single arm most of the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.370 
you have to do it single arm most of the
time<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.850> two<00:01:38.179> arm<00:01:38.390> dumbbell<00:01:38.869> preacher<00:01:39.200> curl

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
time and two arm dumbbell preacher curl

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.429 
time and two arm dumbbell preacher curl

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
doesn't feel good so that is why I did

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.499 
doesn't feel good so that is why I did
pressure<00:01:43.070> curls<00:01:43.399> with<00:01:43.549> EZ<00:01:43.700> bar<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.240> then<00:01:44.479> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
like to tell you one thing though I'm

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.449 
like to tell you one thing though I'm
not<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.150> lean<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.410> lighting<00:02:58.830> made<00:02:59.070> me<00:02:59.310> look

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
not this lean the lighting made me look

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.300 
not this lean the lighting made me look
like<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.330> filter<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.900> my<00:03:01.110> camera<00:03:01.560> is

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
like that and the filter in my camera is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.979 
like that and the filter in my camera is
also<00:03:02.820> very<00:03:03.090> good<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.810> why<00:03:03.900> I'm

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
also very good so that is why I'm

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.320 
also very good so that is why I'm
looking<00:03:04.260> lean<00:03:04.500> when<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.310> come<00:03:05.580> over<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.120> this

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
looking lean when you come over to this

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.020 
looking lean when you come over to this
side<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.959> don't<00:03:07.830> look<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.250> lean<00:03:08.580> because<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
side I don't look that lean because the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.110 
side I don't look that lean because the
lighting<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.510> completely<00:03:10.080> changed<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.120> that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
lighting is completely changed and that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.960 
lighting is completely changed and that
is<00:03:12.239> why<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:13.170> look<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.530> lean<00:03:14.010> on

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
is why I don't look like that lean on

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.979 
is why I don't look like that lean on
the<00:03:15.090> left<00:03:15.330> side<00:03:15.600> ok

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
the left side ok

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.560 
the left side ok
so<00:03:16.620> camera<00:03:17.430> angles<00:03:17.850> make<00:03:18.090> lot<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.450> difference

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
so camera angles make lot of difference

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.759 
so camera angles make lot of difference
as<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> told<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.430> previous<00:03:21.150> video<00:03:21.769> so

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
as I told you in the previous video so

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.490 
as I told you in the previous video so
this<00:03:23.640> exercise<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.180> very<00:03:24.209> good<00:03:24.840> guys<00:03:25.049> cables

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
this exercise is very good guys cables

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
this exercise is very good guys cables
keep<00:03:25.680> constant<00:03:26.340> tension<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.820> your<00:03:26.850> muscles

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
keep constant tension on your muscles

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300 
keep constant tension on your muscles
throughout<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.900> range<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.260> motion<00:03:28.650> if<00:03:29.130> you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
throughout the range of motion if you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.830 
throughout the range of motion if you
are<00:03:29.370> doing<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.760> movement<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.450> barbell

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
are doing this movement on the barbell

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.930 
are doing this movement on the barbell
curl<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.410> come<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.010> way<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.160> there

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
curl and you come all the way up there

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240 
curl and you come all the way up there
won't<00:03:33.150> be<00:03:33.299> complete<00:03:33.840> tension<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.500> biceps

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
won't be complete tension on your biceps

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.310 
won't be complete tension on your biceps
so<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.910> why<00:03:36.060> cable<00:03:36.630> curl<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.049> more

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
so that is why cable curl is more

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.750 
so that is why cable curl is more
beneficial<00:03:37.829> when<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.220> comes<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.579> building

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
beneficial when it comes to building

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.660 
beneficial when it comes to building
mass<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:40.049> heard<00:03:40.260> people<00:03:40.500> telling<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.160> if

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
mass I have heard people telling that if

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.390 
mass I have heard people telling that if
you<00:03:41.850> use<00:03:42.060> barbells<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.320> will<00:03:43.410> build<00:03:43.680> mass<00:03:44.070> and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
you use barbells you will build mass and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.580 
you use barbells you will build mass and
if<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.000> use<00:03:45.239> cables<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.170> will<00:03:46.320> get

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
if you use cables you will get

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.009 
if you use cables you will get
definition<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.790> not<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.120> case<00:03:48.329> I'm

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
definition that is not the case I'm

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.110 
definition that is not the case I'm
using<00:03:49.079> cables<00:03:49.860> right<00:03:50.040> why<00:03:50.280> am<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.519> not<00:03:50.670> defined

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
using cables right why am I not defined

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.690 
using cables right why am I not defined
because<00:03:51.840> my<00:03:51.989> body<00:03:52.200> fat<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.620> kind<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.190> higher<00:03:53.430> so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
because my body fat is kind of higher so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.340 
because my body fat is kind of higher so
that<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.970> why<00:03:54.060> I'm<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.390> well<00:03:54.690> defined<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
that is why I'm not well defined you

rotation<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:23.250> here<00:04:23.520> we<00:04:23.729> are<00:04:23.760> performing<00:04:24.390> that

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
rotation so here we are performing that

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.740 
rotation so here we are performing that
movement<00:04:24.960> when<00:04:25.169> we<00:04:25.320> are<00:04:26.510> bringing<00:04:27.510> the

can see that at this part

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.700 
can see that at this part
we<00:04:32.850> are<00:04:32.940> super<00:04:33.210> netting<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> very

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
we are super netting so this is a very

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.560 
we are super netting so this is a very
good<00:04:34.920> exercise<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.310> your<00:04:35.550> bicep<00:04:35.910> guys<00:04:36.180> the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
good exercise for your bicep guys the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.230 
good exercise for your bicep guys the
only<00:04:36.930> way<00:04:37.080> your<00:04:37.260> muscles<00:04:37.590> will<00:04:37.740> grow<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.460> by

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
only way your muscles will grow is by

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.090 
only way your muscles will grow is by
performing<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.990> function<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.560> your<00:04:40.740> muscles

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
performing the function of your muscles

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.640 
performing the function of your muscles

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
so function of both of the biceps is

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.610 
so function of both of the biceps is
wrist<00:04:44.580> rotation<00:04:44.820> or<00:04:45.240> supination<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.990> elbow

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
wrist rotation or supination and elbow

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.710 
wrist rotation or supination and elbow
flexion<00:04:46.860> right<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.060> how<00:04:48.150> your<00:04:48.330> biceps

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
hardcore way doesn't mean you are going

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.800 
hardcore way doesn't mean you are going
to<00:05:55.830> just<00:05:56.040> jerk<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.520> weights<00:05:56.730> guys<00:05:57.030> form<00:05:57.660> is

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
to just jerk the weights guys form is

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.570 
to just jerk the weights guys form is
very<00:05:57.990> important<00:05:58.560> but<00:05:58.710> hardcore<00:05:59.010> can<00:05:59.370> mean

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
very important but hardcore can mean

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.510 
very important but hardcore can mean
that<00:05:59.820> you<00:06:00.780> are<00:06:00.960> increasing<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.070> intensity

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
that you are increasing the intensity

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.430 
that you are increasing the intensity
you<00:06:02.730> are<00:06:02.760> reducing<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.450> rest<00:06:03.690> period<00:06:04.260> between

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
you are reducing the rest period between

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.730 
you are reducing the rest period between
sets<00:06:04.890> so<00:06:05.520> for<00:06:05.910> all<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.210> super<00:06:06.480> sets<00:06:06.690> we<00:06:07.230> did<00:06:07.410> 3

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
sets so for all the super sets we did 3

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.470 
sets so for all the super sets we did 3
sets<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.460> didn't<00:06:08.670> count<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.030> reps<00:06:09.210> guys<00:06:09.450> I
