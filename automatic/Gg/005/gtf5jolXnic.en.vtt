00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
four different size batteries but um

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.129 
four different size batteries but um
that's<00:04:36.590> pretty<00:04:36.950> much<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.190> I'm<00:04:37.610> about<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.139> get

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
that's pretty much it I'm about to get

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.370 
that's pretty much it I'm about to get
it<00:04:39.260> all<00:04:39.440> set<00:04:39.770> up<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.630> take<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.750> outside<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:42.139> a

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
it all set up and take it outside for a

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.400 
it all set up and take it outside for a
spin<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.950> probably<00:04:43.220> get<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> video<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:43.850> that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
spin and I probably get a video of that

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.029 
spin and I probably get a video of that
see<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.550> all<00:04:46.550> right<00:04:46.729> here<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:46.970> are<00:04:47.180> again<00:04:48.039> I'm

see you all right here we are again I'm

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.930 
see you all right here we are again I'm
going<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.490> try<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.850> do<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.150> few<00:04:51.130> speed<00:04:52.130> runs<00:04:52.460> or

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
going to try to do a few speed runs or

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.620 
going to try to do a few speed runs or
whatever<00:04:53.560> with<00:04:54.560> my<00:04:54.740> 7.2<00:04:55.729> volt<00:04:56.000> batteries<00:04:56.479> it's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
whatever with my 7.2 volt batteries it's

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.379 
whatever with my 7.2 volt batteries it's
not<00:04:56.780> very<00:04:56.960> much<00:04:57.260> but<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:58.820> what<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> got<00:04:59.210> for

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
not very much but it's what I got for

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.390 
not very much but it's what I got for
now<00:04:59.450> I<00:04:59.840> me<00:05:00.830> driving<00:05:01.190> with<00:05:01.340> one<00:05:01.580> hand<00:05:02.289> like<00:05:03.289> this

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
now I me driving with one hand like this

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.950 
now I me driving with one hand like this
because<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.729> hold<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.240> camera<00:05:05.690> with

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
because I have to hold the camera with

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:17.350 
because I have to hold the camera with
the<00:05:06.080> other<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:06.680> let's<00:05:07.550> play

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:38.930 

I<00:05:21.909> guess<00:05:22.909> it's<00:05:23.120> too<00:05:23.750> bad<00:05:23.960> right<00:05:24.319> of<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.560> box

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:49.500 

pretty<00:05:39.940> quick<00:05:40.180> acceleration<00:05:40.510> there<00:05:48.450> well<00:05:49.450> I'm

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
pretty quick acceleration there well I'm

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.240 
pretty quick acceleration there well I'm
going<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.720> put<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:49.930> camera<00:05:50.260> up<00:05:50.290> now<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:50.950> see

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
going to put the camera up now and see

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.700 
going to put the camera up now and see
what<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.430> can<00:05:51.460> do
