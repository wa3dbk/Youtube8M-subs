that<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.000> basic<00:01:21.360> outlines<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.170> where

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that I know the basic outlines and where

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550 
that I know the basic outlines and where
line<00:01:22.950> should<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.759> shouldn't<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.560> then

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
line should be and shouldn't be and then

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.999 
line should be and shouldn't be and then
then<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.580> through<00:01:26.790> build<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.860> then<00:01:28.860> after

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then I go through build it then after

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.880 
then I go through build it then after
I've<00:01:29.250> done<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> initial<00:01:29.729> build<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.560> go<00:01:31.560> through

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I've done the initial build I go through

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
I've done the initial build I go through
and<00:01:32.070> fix<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.430> anything<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> looks<00:01:33.060> odd<00:01:33.240> for

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and fix up anything that looks odd for

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
and fix up anything that looks odd for
example<00:01:33.960> its<00:01:34.049> eyes<00:01:34.229> looked<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.890> odd<00:01:35.130> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
example its eyes looked really odd on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.050 
example its eyes looked really odd on
this<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:37.439> mean<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> I'll

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this one and I mean around the I'll

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.580 
this one and I mean around the I'll
bring<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> bar<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.200> where<00:01:40.500> my

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bring the bar up so you can see where my

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.539 
bring the bar up so you can see where my
curve<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.090> sort<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> area<00:01:42.509> still

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
curve around this sort of area still

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
curve around this sort of area still
probably<00:01:44.549> needs<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.060> bit<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.990> fiddle

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
probably needs a little bit of a fiddle

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.300 
probably needs a little bit of a fiddle
with<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.770> um<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.290> yeah<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> next
