00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
just like to get used to the approach

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
just like to get used to the approach
really<00:01:28.830> quick<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.460> bowling<00:01:29.729> shoes<00:01:29.940> I'm

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
really quick with my bowling shoes I'm

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.639 
really quick with my bowling shoes I'm
wearing<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.479> net<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:31.020> wearing<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> pair<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
wearing a net I'm wearing a pair of

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.570 
wearing a net I'm wearing a pair of
Dexter<00:01:32.130> SS<00:01:32.580> T<00:01:32.880> fives<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.190> I'll<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.429> is

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
Dexter SS T fives so what I'll do is

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.120 
Dexter SS T fives so what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.240> line<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.539> anywhere<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.440> then<00:01:38.009> I'll

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I'll just line up anywhere and then I'll

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.120 
I'll just line up anywhere and then I'll
test<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> approach

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.359 

that<00:01:45.729> gives<00:01:45.909> me<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.119> good<00:01:46.299> idea<00:01:46.329> on<00:01:46.960> how<00:01:47.680> slick

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
that gives me a good idea on how slick

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.109 
that gives me a good idea on how slick
the<00:01:48.490> approaches<00:01:48.939> are<00:01:49.119> if<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:49.719> need<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.049> change

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the approaches are if I need to change

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.149 
the approaches are if I need to change
pads<00:01:52.119> on<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.750> bottom<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.110> my<00:01:53.140> shoe<00:01:53.470> or<00:01:53.829> if<00:01:53.860> I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
pads on the bottom of my shoe or if I

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.380 
pads on the bottom of my shoe or if I
need<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.490> grab<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> brush<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:56.880> take<00:01:57.880> off<00:01:58.060> some

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
need to grab a brush and take off some

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.959 
need to grab a brush and take off some
of<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.630> top<00:01:58.990> surface<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.070> pads<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.820> I'm

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
of the top surface on on the pads so I'm

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:08.460 
of the top surface on on the pads so I'm
gonna<00:02:01.090> do<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.390> again<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.960> get<00:02:02.140> used<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.630 

so<00:02:09.470> basically<00:02:09.830> now<00:02:10.099> you're<00:02:10.280> ready<00:02:10.459> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
so basically now you're ready to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.810 
so basically now you're ready to
practice<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.300> tow<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> ball
