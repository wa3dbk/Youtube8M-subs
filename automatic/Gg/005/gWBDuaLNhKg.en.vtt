00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in the middle of this city was this huge

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
in the middle of this city was this huge
tree<00:00:43.700> very<00:00:44.700> large<00:00:45.059> tree<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.870> mean<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.739> tree<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tree very large tree I mean this tree it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.750 
tree very large tree I mean this tree it
it<00:00:48.000> went<00:00:48.390> clear<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.289> into<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> sky<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it went clear up into the sky and I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.189 
it went clear up into the sky and I
didn't<00:00:51.059> even<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.449> couldn't<00:00:51.750> even<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
didn't even see I couldn't even see the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.400 
didn't even see I couldn't even see the
top<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.920> tall<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.960> published<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
top it was so tall and it published a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 
top it was so tall and it published a
measure<00:00:56.000> across<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.360> butt<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> tree<00:00:58.289> on

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
measure across the butt of this tree on

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.520 
measure across the butt of this tree on
the<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.039> bottom<00:00:59.510> I'm<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.570> guessing<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the very bottom I'm just guessing but I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640 
the very bottom I'm just guessing but I
would<00:01:01.739> say<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:03.110> 300<00:01:04.110> feet<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
would say it would be around 300 feet I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
would say it would be around 300 feet I
mean<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.420> huge

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
mean it was just huge

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.880 
mean it was just huge
it<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> huge<00:01:07.320> tree<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:10.530> were<00:01:10.680> standing

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it was a huge tree and we were standing

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030 
it was a huge tree and we were standing
there<00:01:11.189> looking<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> site<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.740> then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
there looking at this site and just then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
there looking at this site and just then
I<00:01:14.400> looked<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.299> left<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.110> could<00:01:16.320> see

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I looked up to my left and I could see

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.789 
I looked up to my left and I could see
this<00:01:16.799> terrible<00:01:17.520> storm<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.450> coming<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
this terrible storm that was coming and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.510 
this terrible storm that was coming and
the<00:01:20.670> wind<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.479> storm<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the wind from this storm it was just it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.230 
the wind from this storm it was just it
was<00:01:23.580> fierce<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.479> mean

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
was fierce I mean

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.770 
was fierce I mean
wind<00:01:25.450> was<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:25.810> incredible<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:28.090> we

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
wind was just incredible and we we

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.020 
wind was just incredible and we we
really<00:01:29.229> were<00:01:29.409> wondering<00:01:29.860> if<00:01:30.010> that<00:01:30.190> huge<00:01:31.000> tree

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
really were wondering if that huge tree

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.830 
really were wondering if that huge tree
was<00:01:31.450> gonna<00:01:31.630> build<00:01:31.840> withstand<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.680> wind<00:01:33.010> well

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
was gonna build withstand this wind well

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340 
was gonna build withstand this wind well
just<00:01:34.840> then<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.080> huge<00:01:35.619> gust<00:01:36.130> came<00:01:36.840> across<00:01:37.840> that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
just then a huge gust came across that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.760 
just then a huge gust came across that
city<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:40.119> Quentin<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:41.049> tree<00:01:41.320> couldn't

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
city and it Quentin the tree couldn't

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.180 
city and it Quentin the tree couldn't
withstand<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:44.170> wind<00:01:44.440> from<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.800> force<00:01:45.070> from

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
withstand the wind from the force from

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.630 
withstand the wind from the force from
the<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.479> we<00:01:47.320> remember<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:47.890> just<00:01:48.040> if<00:01:48.340> came

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
the and we remember it just if came

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.480 
the and we remember it just if came
right<00:01:48.880> down<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.659> was<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.050> great<00:01:50.649> crash<00:01:51.070> I

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
right down and it was a great crash I

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.450 
right down and it was a great crash I
mean<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:53.409> was<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.770> large<00:01:54.100> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
mean it just it was so large the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.030 
mean it just it was so large the
treatment<00:01:54.850> being<00:01:55.149> so<00:01:55.390> large<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:56.110> did<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:56.770> much

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
treatment being so large it did so much

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.419 
treatment being so large it did so much
damage<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.910> lot<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.590> buildings<00:01:59.590> because<00:02:00.399> of

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
damage to a lot of buildings because of

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.340 
damage to a lot of buildings because of
its<00:02:00.729> size<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:03.810> thought<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.990> was<00:02:05.140> pretty

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
its size so I thought that was pretty

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.009 
its size so I thought that was pretty
interesting<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.030> was<00:02:07.149> just<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:07.750> real

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
interesting and and it was just so real

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.410 
interesting and and it was just so real
so<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.470> thought<00:02:08.800> I'd<00:02:08.979> share<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.489> but<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.330> know

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so I thought I'd share that but you know

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.840 
so I thought I'd share that but you know
in<00:02:10.570> times<00:02:10.810> past<00:02:10.959> I've<00:02:11.530> I've<00:02:11.890> had<00:02:11.950> dreams<00:02:12.550> about

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
in times past I've I've had dreams about

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.340 
in times past I've I've had dreams about
