it's a little hard to see who's talking
he's<00:03:46.099> right<00:03:46.280> now<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.700> how<00:03:47.620> temperature<00:03:48.620> is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800

talking<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.310> he's<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.580> like<00:03:50.209> in<00:03:50.360> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.390 
foreground or using highlighted in some
ways<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:54.260> can<00:03:54.500> be<00:03:54.620> difficult<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:55.069> tell<00:03:55.280> but

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
ways it can be difficult to tell but

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.540 
ways it can be difficult to tell but
sometimes<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.000> characters<00:03:56.360> will<00:03:56.540> move<00:03:56.750> like

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
sometimes the characters will move like

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.420 
sometimes the characters will move like
so<00:03:58.550> see<00:03:59.239> pavement<00:03:59.900> position<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:04.160> I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
so see pavement position but it's I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.710 
so see pavement position but it's I
don't<00:04:07.430> know<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.760> dialogue<00:04:08.209> it's<00:04:08.390> kind<00:04:08.690> of

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
don't know the dialogue it's kind of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.390 
don't know the dialogue it's kind of
weird<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.140> we<00:04:09.290> haven't<00:04:09.470> had<00:04:09.590> any<00:04:09.650> music<00:04:10.190> game

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
weird and we haven't had any music game

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.910 
weird and we haven't had any music game
so<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:13.160> again<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:14.390> isn't<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:15.140> guess<00:04:15.470> an<00:04:15.620> early

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
so and again this isn't I guess an early

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.659 
so and again this isn't I guess an early
fail<00:04:16.100> oh<00:04:16.130> they're<00:04:16.489> early<00:04:16.660> version<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:17.989> just

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
fail oh they're early version so just

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.040 
fail oh they're early version so just
hasn't<00:04:19.669> been<00:04:19.910> gotten<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.690> yet<00:04:21.490> but<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:24.020> know

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
hasn't been gotten to yet but you know

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.969 
hasn't been gotten to yet but you know
we'll<00:04:24.800> see<00:04:25.010> if<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.729> loads<00:04:26.080> again<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.320> can't<00:04:27.770> tell

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
we'll see if it loads again I can't tell

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.250 
we'll see if it loads again I can't tell
if<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.190> loading<00:04:28.520> or<00:04:28.639> not<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:29.000> just<00:04:29.050> hope<00:04:30.050> no<00:04:30.229> I

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
if it's loading or not it just hope no I

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:47.969 
if it's loading or not it just hope no I
guess<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.740> oh<00:04:32.320> yeah<00:04:33.320> music<00:04:33.440> oh<00:04:33.889> yeah<00:04:40.570> oh

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.469 

yeah<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:55.190> honestly<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.880> feels<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.270> lot<00:04:56.419> more

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
yeah and honestly this feels a lot more

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.450 
yeah and honestly this feels a lot more
like<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.840> narrative<00:04:57.169> game<00:04:57.470> once<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.220> get<00:04:58.370> the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
like a narrative game once you get the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.560 
like a narrative game once you get the
music<00:04:58.820> in<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.060> and<00:05:00.970> you<00:05:01.970> notice<00:05:02.240> I'm<00:05:02.450> just

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
guess that's it forward an hour to be

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.190 
guess that's it forward an hour to be
put<00:05:20.599> in<00:05:20.720> an<00:05:20.840> ultimate<00:05:21.229> ninja<00:05:21.320> battle<00:05:21.849> dean

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
put in an ultimate ninja battle dean

put in an ultimate ninja battle dean
this<00:05:24.340> this<00:05:25.340> next<00:05:25.610> fight<00:05:25.700> hasn't<00:05:25.940> been<00:05:26.180> created

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
this this next fight hasn't been created

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.290 
this this next fight hasn't been created
yet<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.050> i<00:05:27.440> guess<00:05:28.430> that's<00:05:28.580> about<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.849> for<00:05:29.180> this

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
yet so i guess that's about it for this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.240 
yet so i guess that's about it for this
time<00:05:29.660> oh<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:31.580> that<00:05:32.410> what<00:05:33.410> is<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.710> oh<00:05:33.830> this<00:05:34.130> is

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
time oh is that what is it oh this is

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:45.100 
time oh is that what is it oh this is
just<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.490> intro<00:05:34.729> game<00:05:34.940> okay

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.010 

anyway<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:47.490> that's<00:05:47.730> not<00:05:48.210> Russia<00:05:48.450> put<00:05:48.930> an

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
anyway so that's not Russia put an

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.670 
anyway so that's not Russia put an
ultimate<00:05:49.500> ninja<00:05:49.620> battle<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.820> it's<00:05:51.680> it's

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
ultimate ninja battle and it's it's

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.950 
ultimate ninja battle and it's it's
obviously<00:05:53.100> not<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.970> really<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.540> show<00:05:54.780> it

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
obviously not that and really to show it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.430 
obviously not that and really to show it
the<00:05:55.430> audio<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.810> sometimes<00:05:57.810> not<00:05:57.960> there<00:05:58.230> but

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
the audio is sometimes not there but

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.350 
the audio is sometimes not there but
when<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.680> audio<00:05:58.950> is<00:05:59.130> there<00:05:59.400> it's<00:05:59.730> pretty<00:06:00.060> cool

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
when the audio is there it's pretty cool

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.710 
when the audio is there it's pretty cool
cuz<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.260> know<00:06:01.380> it's<00:06:01.560> really<00:06:02.420> pink<00:06:03.420> it<00:06:03.600> looks

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
cuz you know it's really pink it looks

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.240 
cuz you know it's really pink it looks
like<00:06:03.960> you<00:06:04.200> know<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.500> music<00:06:04.740> they<00:06:04.950> put<00:06:05.160> in

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
like you know the music they put in

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.450 
like you know the music they put in
Konami<00:06:05.550> code<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:05.970> it<00:06:06.600> makes<00:06:06.810> it<00:06:06.900> more<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.140> a

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
Konami code so it makes it more of a

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.180 
Konami code so it makes it more of a
real<00:06:08.460> product<00:06:09.030> or<00:06:09.210> like<00:06:09.390> a<00:06:09.420> finish<00:06:10.320> without
