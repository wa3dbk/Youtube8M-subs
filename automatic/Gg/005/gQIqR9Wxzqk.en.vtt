00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
a couple of rest days you can see some

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.240 
a couple of rest days you can see some
physiological<00:02:17.090> changes<00:02:17.450> taking<00:02:17.690> place<00:02:18.250> your

physiological changes taking place your
resting<00:02:19.640> heart<00:02:19.820> rate<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.450> higher<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:21.020> you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
resting heart rate can get higher as you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.620 
resting heart rate can get higher as you
get<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> bit<00:02:21.470> more<00:02:21.500> tired<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.360> at<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.450> other

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
get a bit more tired and at the other

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.050 
get a bit more tired and at the other
end<00:02:23.890> your<00:02:24.890> maximum<00:02:25.250> heart<00:02:25.520> rate<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.790> actually

end your maximum heart rate can actually

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.360 
end your maximum heart rate can actually
decrease<00:02:26.450> slightly<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.140> when<00:02:28.040> you're<00:02:28.160> tired

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
decrease slightly so when you're tired

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.890 
decrease slightly so when you're tired
you're<00:02:28.610> slightly<00:02:28.820> harder<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.540> those<00:02:29.660> high

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
you're slightly harder to get those high

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.150 
you're slightly harder to get those high
heart<00:02:30.170> rates<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.590> might<00:02:30.739> see<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.070> the

heart rates that you might see in the
first<00:02:31.370> week<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.930> interestingly<00:02:34.239> doesn't

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270

the<00:02:41.420> rider<00:02:41.630> finds<00:02:41.959> over<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> course<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.370> three

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the rider finds over the course of three

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
the rider finds over the course of three
weeks<00:02:43.670> their<00:02:44.060> power<00:02:44.270> can<00:02:44.480> actually<00:02:44.750> increase

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
weeks their power can actually increase

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.400 
weeks their power can actually increase
so<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.850> ways<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so it's just one of the ways one of the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
so it's just one of the ways one of the

meters<00:04:39.110> just<00:04:39.139> over<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.820> there's<00:04:40.970> still<00:04:41.289> 750

so<00:04:45.110> already<00:04:45.500> here
