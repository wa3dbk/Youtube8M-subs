00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.460
 today we will know how to 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:10.599
 logical as well as physical connection between 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.860
 a basic zeta pt and a meriva dvr 840 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.390
 of four channels we will need separate 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.320
 of the zeta pt 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.140
 meriva 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.660
 four channels on the back as 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 we can see is the connection 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.710
 besides that we will need a package 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.530
 of v s 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.500
 we will also need a couple of threads of 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.380
 atp 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.580
 a cable splice and finally 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.580
 a source of power 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 As such, he desires this account with a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 video cable a power cable and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.160
 finally a data cable 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.350
 inside the fancy is we are going to us 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.380
 to configure 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.960
 what is named the physical part is 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.830
 say the parameters as protocol 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.310
 Haitian and speed inside her 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 we found a 10 deep switch 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.530
 pills which going up or down 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.070
 these clichÃ©s give us different 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 configurations 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.160
 we make the connection 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.220
 in the zeta pt on the data cable that 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.260
 as such it marks us a positive and a 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.040
 negative 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.510
 if we must connect it 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.510
 what is the part of the dvr 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.909
 once the cable splice is finished 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.929
 do not 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.929
 towards the dvr 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.770
 in the video connection in the patchwork 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.230
 of bnc we introduce it in one of the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.450
 video channels and it's important 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.170
 emphasize that this video channel will go 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.220
 associated 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.090
 the number d 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.090
 in the peseta 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 finally we proceed to the connection of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.200
 the pulses or the data of the pt z for 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:34.850
 just to be able to move it we refer 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.850
 the positive as ye and the negative as z 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.620
 once having the connection as 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.010
 sample 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 just to emphasize the part of the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.440
 rs 485 connection and positive and negative z 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 finally we energize the zeta pt 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.970
 in addition to the dvr and automatically we 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.750
 will appear 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.860
 video inside the dvr we achieved or we 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.410
 we introduce the dvr 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.960
 by means of a password that has 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.140
 configured and we enter 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.780
 inside the dvr we will appear hedge 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.350
 then we go to the pt section 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.050
 zetas and enable the channel where you are 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.090
 the default video has certain 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.510
 configurations but in this case 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.370
 we will make the configuration of the fancy 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 is in factory values this is has 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.960
 Belgian protocol of 2400 with fasting 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.530
 we keep 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.530
 and we left 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.470
 after this we select the camera 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.450
 in big we go to the section of pt z 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.100
 for the virtual joystick and for 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.260
 check if there is a connection 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.300
 move the pt zetas and the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.300
 settings were the right ones 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.030
 this is the edit switch section in the 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.030
 which one you should refer to your manual
