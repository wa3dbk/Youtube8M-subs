00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.530 

I<00:00:07.589> should<00:00:08.340> be<00:00:08.460> making<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.820> video<00:00:08.969> since<00:00:09.420> I'm

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I should be making a video since I'm

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.529 
I should be making a video since I'm
actually<00:00:09.690> doing<00:00:10.049> a<00:00:10.260> mod<00:00:10.820> well<00:00:11.820> Tmax

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:12.539 
actually doing a mod well Tmax

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.369 
actually doing a mod well Tmax
um<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.910> way<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.209> works<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.750> usually<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.199> see

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
um the way it works is usually you see

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
um the way it works is usually you see
the<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.070> wasn't<00:00:17.310> lamp<00:00:17.609> one<00:00:18.270> headlamp<00:00:18.689> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the one that wasn't lamp one headlamp is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.740 
the one that wasn't lamp one headlamp is
always<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.320> no<00:00:19.590> other<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.250> isn't<00:00:20.460> well<00:00:21.449> I'm

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
always on no other one isn't well I'm

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.319 
always on no other one isn't well I'm
gonna<00:00:21.869> make<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> jumper<00:00:22.650> which<00:00:23.519> pretty<00:00:24.240> much

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
gonna make a jumper which pretty much

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.659 
gonna make a jumper which pretty much
jumps<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.560> other<00:00:25.769> lamps<00:00:26.249> so<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
jumps the other lamps so I'm going to

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.480 
jumps the other lamps so I'm going to
have<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:26.939> running<00:00:27.300> lamps<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.470> bright<00:00:28.800> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
have two running lamps and one bright so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
have two running lamps and one bright so
sort<00:00:29.909> of<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.089> being<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> bright<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:31.769> gonna

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
sort of this being the bright I'm gonna

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.920 
sort of this being the bright I'm gonna
have<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.489> running<00:00:32.759> lamps<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.300> bright<00:00:33.480> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
have two running lamps and a bright so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
have two running lamps and a bright so
if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:34.950> standard<00:00:35.430> bulb

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
if you can see here that's standard bulb

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
if you can see here that's standard bulb
and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.810> see<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> larger<00:00:37.500> bulb

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and then you can see it's a larger bulb

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.850 
and then you can see it's a larger bulb
and<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> filament<00:00:40.370> 30-30

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
and that's actually do a filament 30-30

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.050 
and that's actually do a filament 30-30
normally<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.130> running<00:00:44.370> lamp<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.880> right

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
normally the one running lamp is right

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.610 
normally the one running lamp is right
here<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.630> can't<00:00:46.080> show<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.290> because<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.590> just

video by
I<00:00:59.620> was<00:01:00.620> never<00:01:00.920> really<00:01:01.280> good<00:01:01.430> at<00:01:01.580> soldering<00:01:01.880> and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
I was never really good at soldering and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.950 
I was never really good at soldering and
this<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.489> what<00:01:04.730> you<00:01:04.879> do<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:05.330> heat<00:01:05.660> up<00:01:05.810> your

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
this is what you do you heat up your

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.820 
this is what you do you heat up your
base<00:01:06.170> metal<00:01:06.850> first<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.590> use<00:01:09.800> your

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
base metal first and then you use your

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.460 
base metal first and then you use your
solder<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.390> just<00:01:11.600> fill<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.050> in<00:01:12.140> there<00:01:12.320> so

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
solder and you just fill it in there so

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.340 
solder and you just fill it in there so
it's<00:01:12.560> like<00:01:12.620> welding<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.910> have<00:01:14.060> new

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
it's like welding you have to have new

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.440 
it's like welding you have to have new
neutral<00:01:15.350> heat<00:01:15.640> meaning<00:01:16.640> both<00:01:16.820> parts<00:01:17.270> that

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
neutral heat meaning both parts that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.060 
neutral heat meaning both parts that
you're<00:01:17.570> welding<00:01:17.780> have<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.380> relatively

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
you're welding have to have relatively

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.630 
you're welding have to have relatively
the<00:01:19.280> same<00:01:19.520> temperature<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:22.220> that's<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.580> I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
the same temperature so that's that I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.270 
the same temperature so that's that I
can't<00:01:23.150> really<00:01:23.479> do<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:23.930> because<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.260> need<00:01:24.320> like

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
can't really do this because I need like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.660 
can't really do this because I need like
use<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:25.640> hand<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:27.650> really<00:01:27.890> could<00:01:28.040> try<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.310> do<00:01:28.520> it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
use my hand we really could try to do it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.260 
use my hand we really could try to do it
one-handed

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
one-handed

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.899 
one-handed
I<00:01:29.420> can't<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.530> also<00:01:30.770> show<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 

and<00:01:36.840> there's<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.290> finished<00:01:37.439> globular

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and there's your finished globular

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
and there's your finished globular
cluster<00:01:38.460> can't<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.539> too<00:01:39.719> well<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.110> I'm

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
cluster can't see it too well but I'm

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.630 
cluster can't see it too well but I'm
going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> crimp<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> together<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.399> my

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going to crimp it together with my

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990 
going to crimp it together with my
pliers<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> tape<00:01:43.289> it<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.460> jumper<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pliers and tape it and this jumper is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
pliers and tape it and this jumper is
going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> connect<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> work

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.200 

voila<00:01:51.140> tape<00:01:52.140> job<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> complete<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.000> one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
voila tape job is complete we have one

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
voila tape job is complete we have one
lead<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.900> feed<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.010> other<00:01:56.160> side

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.010 

okay<00:02:10.910> here's<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.330> moment<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.810> truth

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.910

White's work so cool so the dual

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480 
White's work so cool so the dual
headlight<00:02:23.520> mod<00:02:23.730> works<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> will<00:02:26.220> show<00:02:26.400> you

headlight mod works and will show you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:39.190 
headlight mod works and will show you
the<00:02:26.610> blinkers<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.240> brights

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
really completely secure I'm gonna have

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.970 
really completely secure I'm gonna have
to<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.939> pry<00:02:59.939> out<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.239> metal<00:03:00.870> tab<00:03:01.049> so
