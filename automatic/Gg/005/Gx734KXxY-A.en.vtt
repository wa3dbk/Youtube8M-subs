not quite the same extent with any where

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
not quite the same extent with any where
there<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.910> anyhow<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:58.109> have

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there me so anyhow I don't have

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
there me so anyhow I don't have
struggled<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.879> often

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
struggled with this because I have often

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.139 
struggled with this because I have often
talked<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:01.050> muscle<00:01:01.440> space<00:01:02.149> stiff

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
talked about my muscle space stiff

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.289 
talked about my muscle space stiff
rather<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:06.020> weak<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:09.030> quite

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
rather than weak and I think I'm quite

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
rather than weak and I think I'm quite
thick<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:10.020> until<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> realized<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thick really until I realized that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.240 
thick really until I realized that
actually<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.330> describing<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:13.350> my

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
actually what I was describing was my

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.690 
actually what I was describing was my
muscles<00:01:14.670> being<00:01:14.939> weak<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.590> stiffness<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
muscles being weak and the stiffness the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.490 
muscles being weak and the stiffness the
shaking<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.900> comes<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.700> my<00:01:20.700> muscles

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
shaking actually comes from my muscles

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
shaking actually comes from my muscles
struggling<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.680> support<00:01:23.220> me<00:01:23.580> under<00:01:24.030> support

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
struggling to support me under support

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
struggling to support me under support
things<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.530> doing<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> give<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> a

short demonstration now this little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.569 
short demonstration now this little
remote<00:01:29.159> control<00:01:29.220> weighs<00:01:29.909> six<00:01:30.479> ounces<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.579> at

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
remote control weighs six ounces and at

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.090 
remote control weighs six ounces and at
my<00:01:32.820> age<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.540> should<00:01:33.960> easily<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.500> able<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> hold

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
my age I should easily be able to hold

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.870 
my age I should easily be able to hold
out<00:01:35.400> straight<00:01:36.030> without<00:01:36.240> any<00:01:36.439> problems<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
out straight without any problems now I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480 
out straight without any problems now I
can't<00:01:39.240> prove<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:39.840> faking<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
can't prove I'm not faking this so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
can't prove I'm not faking this so
you'll<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> take<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.270> word<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.899> or

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you'll have to take my word for it or

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
just ignore it but this is what happens

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
just ignore it but this is what happens
if<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.990> try<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> hold<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.310> six<00:01:47.549> ounces

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
if I try to hold this out the six ounces

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.219 
if I try to hold this out the six ounces
remember<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:49.170> short<00:01:50.009> period<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:51.229> now

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
remember very short period of time now

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.340 
remember very short period of time now
I've<00:01:52.649> already<00:01:52.979> done<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.939> once<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
I've already done this once because the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.069 
I've already done this once because the
first<00:01:55.619> video<00:01:56.040> went<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> can't

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
first video went so actually I can't

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.630 
first video went so actually I can't
even<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.649> long<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.040> could<00:01:59.100> before<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
even do it as long as I could before and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
even do it as long as I could before and
it's<00:01:59.729> already<00:02:00.000> becoming<00:02:00.420> very<00:02:00.689> heavy<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it's already becoming very heavy and you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's already becoming very heavy and you
can<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.189> my<00:02:02.750> muscles<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.840> straining<00:02:04.939> in<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
can see my muscles are straining in the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
can see my muscles are straining in the
way<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.600> shaking<00:02:07.200> its

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
way that it's shaking its

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.940 
way that it's shaking its
like<00:02:07.940> hi<00:02:08.940> I've<00:02:09.360> been<00:02:09.420> holding<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.560> hours

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
like hi I've been holding this for hours

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.449 
like hi I've been holding this for hours
now<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.459> ridiculous<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
now that's ridiculous but that is the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.650 
now that's ridiculous but that is the
sort<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.880> problems<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.319> any<00:02:17.010> causes<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
sort of problems but any causes to the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
sort of problems but any causes to the
muscles<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.230> people<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.680> MA<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
muscles of people with MA then it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.820 
muscles of people with MA then it
affects<00:02:20.819> every<00:02:21.420> muscles<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.410> muscles

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
affects every muscles from the muscles

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.460 
affects every muscles from the muscles
in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:22.980> eyes<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.670> voice<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.630> put<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.230> down

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.900

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
everywhere now I'm going to make another

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.940 
everywhere now I'm going to make another
short<00:02:30.300> parts<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:30.930> video<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.380> show<00:02:31.680> what

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
of the angle of the camera but I hope it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.670

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
as you can see already it's becoming a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.950 
as you can see already it's becoming a
effort<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.650> able<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.060> form<00:03:43.550> form<00:03:44.550> words<00:03:44.960> and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
effort to be able to form form words and

effort to be able to form form words and
my<00:03:46.290> hand<00:03:46.770> actually<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.160> becoming<00:03:47.580> too<00:03:47.760> stiff

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
my hand actually is becoming too stiff

00:03:48.120 --> 00:04:01.730 
my hand actually is becoming too stiff
now<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.420> be<00:03:48.690> able<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.050> do<00:03:49.620> much<00:03:49.920> more<00:04:00.230> that's<00:04:01.230> it

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
now to be able to do much more that's it

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.949 
now to be able to do much more that's it
I<00:04:01.940> don't<00:04:02.940> know<00:04:03.000> whether<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.390> can<00:04:03.510> see<00:04:03.750> that

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
I don't know whether you can see that

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.030 
I don't know whether you can see that
very<00:04:04.140> well<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:05.160> that's<00:04:05.400> how<00:04:05.640> my<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.470> writing

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
very well but that's how my and writing

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.390 
very well but that's how my and writing
goes<00:04:08.280> after<00:04:09.170> just<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.320> very<00:04:10.620> short<00:04:10.980> bit<00:04:11.310> of

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
goes after just a very short bit of

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.699 
goes after just a very short bit of
effort<00:04:11.760> Carly<00:04:12.150> Brighton<00:04:12.660> fact<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.680> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
effort Carly Brighton fact this is a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.190 
effort Carly Brighton fact this is a
second<00:04:14.160> attempt<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.060> did<00:04:15.570> manage<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.900> write

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
second attempt so I did manage to write

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.530 
second attempt so I did manage to write
one<00:04:16.440> whole<00:04:16.680> sentence<00:04:17.190> first<00:04:17.640> time<00:04:17.970> around<00:04:18.120> but

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
one whole sentence first time around but

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.490 
one whole sentence first time around but
now<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:20.160> becoming<00:04:20.760> less<00:04:21.180> possible<00:04:21.780> you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
now that's becoming less possible you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.050 
now that's becoming less possible you
can<00:04:22.590> understand<00:04:23.070> why<00:04:23.250> at<00:04:23.430> times<00:04:23.460> I've<00:04:24.030> thought

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
can understand why at times I've thought

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.590 
can understand why at times I've thought
I've<00:04:24.530> got<00:04:26.060> Parkinson's<00:04:27.060> rather<00:04:27.540> than<00:04:27.840> than<00:04:28.410> MA

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
I've got Parkinson's rather than than MA

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.270 
I've got Parkinson's rather than than MA
because<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:31.919> happens

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280

try to demonstrate to you what happens
with<00:04:53.400> my<00:04:53.550> legs<00:04:53.790> no<00:04:54.000> I've<00:04:54.120> done<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.540> before<00:04:54.600> on

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850

with my legs no I've done this before on
YouTube<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.210> those<00:04:57.390> who<00:04:57.600> have<00:04:57.630> seen<00:04:57.900> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
YouTube so those who have seen the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.590 
YouTube so those who have seen the
videos<00:04:58.350> again<00:04:58.620> don't<00:04:59.460> be<00:04:59.580> obsessed<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.360> I

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
videos again don't be obsessed but I

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.900 
videos again don't be obsessed but I
just<00:05:01.530> want<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.919> be<00:05:02.010> able<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.220> show<00:05:02.400> us<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.640> hate

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
just want to be able to show us I hate

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.880 
just want to be able to show us I hate
showing<00:05:03.210> myself<00:05:03.890> for<00:05:05.090> length<00:05:06.090> but<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.960> think

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
showing myself for length but I think

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.150 
showing myself for length but I think
it's<00:05:08.040> important<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.550> people<00:05:08.760> understand

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
it's important that people understand

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.620 
it's important that people understand
how<00:05:11.160> this<00:05:11.430> affects<00:05:11.850> know<00:05:12.090> what<00:05:12.300> everyone's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
how this affects know what everyone's

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.890 
how this affects know what everyone's
affected<00:05:12.930> in<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.380> way<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.240> am<00:05:15.240> but<00:05:15.570> I

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
affected in the way that I am but I

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.159 
affected in the way that I am but I
think<00:05:16.410> this<00:05:16.560> just<00:05:16.740> sort<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.070> is<00:05:17.669> to<00:05:18.030> show<00:05:18.240> the

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
think this just sort of is to show the

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.420 
think this just sort of is to show the
point<00:05:19.410> okay<00:05:20.030> so<00:05:21.030> I'll<00:05:21.270> go<00:05:21.630> outside<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.710> try<00:05:23.370> to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
point okay so I'll go outside and try to

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.960 
point okay so I'll go outside and try to
make<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.790> video<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.570> me<00:05:25.470> attempting<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.640> wash

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
make a video of me attempting to wash

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.290 
make a video of me attempting to wash
short<00:05:27.810> distance<00:05:28.290> I<00:05:28.590> think<00:05:29.370> I'll<00:05:29.669> have<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:29.880> rely

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
short distance I think I'll have to rely

00:05:30.300 --> 00:06:13.600 
short distance I think I'll have to rely
on<00:05:30.330> my<00:05:31.610> walking<00:05:32.610> stick<00:05:32.700> for<00:05:33.030> this<00:05:33.120> one<00:05:33.390> there

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.610 

well<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.639> decided<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:15.569> try<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:15.960> do<00:06:16.319> the<00:06:16.440> walking

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
well I decided to try to do the walking

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.840 
well I decided to try to do the walking
without<00:06:17.180> because<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.300> can<00:06:18.479> say<00:06:18.690> um<00:06:19.490> perhaps<00:06:20.490> I

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
without because you can say um perhaps I

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.020 
without because you can say um perhaps I
it's<00:06:21.270> not<00:06:21.509> as<00:06:21.780> clear<00:06:22.740> as<00:06:22.949> I<00:06:23.069> would<00:06:23.280> like<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.910> to

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
it's not as clear as I would like it to

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.689 
it's not as clear as I would like it to
be<00:06:24.060> but<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:24.810> think<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.139> can<00:06:25.319> understand<00:06:25.830> some

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
be but I think you can understand some

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.999 
be but I think you can understand some
of<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:27.000> problems<00:06:27.389> that<00:06:27.479> have<00:06:27.780> happened<00:06:28.440> in

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
of the problems that have happened in

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:36.999 
of the problems that have happened in
terms<00:06:29.639> of<00:06:30.560> muscle<00:06:31.560> take<00:06:32.310> ability

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.800 

hopefully<00:06:38.009> it'll<00:06:38.310> throw<00:06:39.030> in<00:06:39.300> slightly

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
hopefully it'll throw in slightly

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.950 
hopefully it'll throw in slightly
interesting<00:06:40.610> again<00:06:41.610> to<00:06:42.090> hear<00:06:42.300> others<00:06:42.599> have

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
interesting again to hear others have

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.300 
interesting again to hear others have
the<00:06:43.110> same<00:06:44.539> sorts<00:06:45.539> of<00:06:45.630> problems<00:06:46.590> now<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.099> think

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
the same sorts of problems now I think

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.279 
the same sorts of problems now I think
I've<00:06:47.669> probably<00:06:48.030> already<00:06:49.130> done<00:06:51.020> too<00:06:52.020> much<00:06:52.229> for

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
I've probably already done too much for

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.270 
I've probably already done too much for
my<00:06:52.680> morning<00:06:52.949> then<00:06:53.280> I'll<00:06:54.090> have<00:06:54.389> to<00:06:55.349> rest<00:06:55.590> before

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
my morning then I'll have to rest before

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.379 
my morning then I'll have to rest before
I<00:06:56.490> put<00:06:56.820> this<00:06:56.970> together<00:06:57.210> so<00:06:57.690> I'll<00:06:59.060> speak<00:07:00.060> to<00:07:00.090> you

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
I put this together so I'll speak to you

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.550 
I put this together so I'll speak to you
all<00:07:00.509> again<00:07:00.810> very<00:07:01.020> soon<00:07:01.560> bye
