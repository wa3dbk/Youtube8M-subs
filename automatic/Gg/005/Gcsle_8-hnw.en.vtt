they feel like OD eyes perceive they

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.980 
they feel like OD eyes perceive they
have<00:02:22.240> them<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:23.370> each<00:02:24.370> side<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:24.940> diagonal<00:02:25.750> or

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.850 
have them like each side or diagonal or
up<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:26.980> side<00:02:27.370> side<00:02:28.080> there<00:02:29.080> they

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
up and down side side there they

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.980 
up and down side side there they
actually<00:02:30.160> feel<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.340> ODI<00:02:30.700> scoffs<00:02:31.090> not<00:02:31.690> ultra

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
actually feel like ODI scoffs not ultra

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.050 
actually feel like ODI scoffs not ultra
soft<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.530> they're<00:02:33.130> still<00:02:33.280> really<00:02:33.580> squishy

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
soft but they're still really squishy

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.920 
soft but they're still really squishy
and<00:02:34.090> soft<00:02:34.620> these<00:02:35.620> were<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:36.610> 999<00:02:37.510> which<00:02:37.810> is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and soft these were I think 999 which is

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.380 
and soft these were I think 999 which is
pretty<00:02:38.050> good<00:02:38.290> fit<00:02:38.590> st.<00:02:39.550> Phyllis<00:02:39.790> OD<00:02:39.940> eyes<00:02:40.120> but

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
pretty good fit st. Phyllis OD eyes but

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.800 
pretty good fit st. Phyllis OD eyes but
ODI<00:02:40.900> for<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.170> 12<00:02:41.410> hours<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:43.450> guess<00:02:43.660> they

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
ODI for like 12 hours and I guess they

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
ODI for like 12 hours and I guess they
gave<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.140> something<00:02:44.380> new<00:02:44.770> which<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.550> not
