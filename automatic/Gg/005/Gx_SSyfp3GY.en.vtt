00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.370
 Music will do it for you and also 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.220
 the jc is on the music fair 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 Duesenberg greets you, you have us here 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.930
 a signature brought good part 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 by whom is this the new my 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.440
 campell the mycam p2 mike mpg tores by 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 tom petty the heartbreakers 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.539
 he is already inside but we already have 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.830
 very nice and have one last year 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.310
 brought out the guitar had the full 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.900
 Hello 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 that was filling a whole a hi 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.300
 So no steak completely hollow 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 the animal as on the pedal something 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.180
 we've got gold boost that 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.190
 is a booster pedals we thought 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 okay we simply take the guitar the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 he likes it and next to the booster 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 both are one and the same 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.170
 this is the mycam p2 which is so far too 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.329
 the part is just like that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.320
 fullerton hollow and here he is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 so to speak the desktop that's that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 paddle board which is very small now 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.350
 draufgesetzt 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 that's actually an effect p3 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.709
 what healed from the out of the housing 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.990
 have taken out and have us time 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.079
 the guitar rhine built and that is in 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.340
 principle quite simple is a cd booster 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.999
 we have him in there sitting there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 who does not hear when he does 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.670
 when i turn on for example 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.350
 the guitar now has the appearance 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 there is no crack or something that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 was just very important elsewhere 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
 You can bring feelings here now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.509
 stepless regulate how many buhs 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.830
 we just have one now 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.830
 chord games 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 cough and campe a bit 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.760
 uses that for the snow to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 example any single notes and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.310
 turned on booster and makes it so 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 so melodic feedbacks but just 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 not loud enough to do that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.500
 but to be able to use that and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.940
 as I said when I is him from before 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 really completely out except guitar 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.590
 everything is completely complete with nothing 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 to do the pick ups 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 Ultimately also important if you pedal 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.800
 it has always impedance changes in it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 and such stories and that was why 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.250
 us also important that when you turn off 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 he really is out and directs 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.090
 always off so you set one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.880
 Focus on it and if it's direct 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.920
 built is very nice I suggest 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.800
 So to conclude you still play 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.900
 few sounds and lets us do that again 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.180
 here we participate in this 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.180
 nice gimmick thank you for the moment
