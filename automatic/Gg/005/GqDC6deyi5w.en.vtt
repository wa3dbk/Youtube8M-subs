mini USB port which is great because you
can<00:02:48.200> connect<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.100> TV<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:52.040> would

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
can connect it to the TV and you would

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.630 
can connect it to the TV and you would
reduce<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.420> USB<00:02:54.140> port<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.800> charging<00:02:54.830> as<00:02:55.489> well

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
reduce the USB port for charging as well

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.790 
reduce the USB port for charging as well
and<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.989> good<00:02:57.140> thing<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.680> I

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
and the good thing is that like I

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.220 
and the good thing is that like I
mentioned<00:02:58.130> earlier<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:59.180> got<00:02:59.360> eight<00:02:59.510> gigs<00:02:59.750> of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
mentioned earlier it's got eight gigs of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.539 
mentioned earlier it's got eight gigs of
storage<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.690> using<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.810> micro<00:03:03.560> SD<00:03:03.920> slot<00:03:03.950> you

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
storage but using this micro SD slot you

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.420 
storage but using this micro SD slot you
can<00:03:04.820> increase<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.420> memory<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:06.380> 40<00:03:06.860> gigs<00:03:07.130> which

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
can increase the memory to 40 gigs which

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.710 
can increase the memory to 40 gigs which
is<00:03:07.580> again<00:03:07.880> pretty<00:03:08.480> good<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.360> side<00:03:11.540> right

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
is again pretty good on this side right

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.039 
is again pretty good on this side right
here<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:12.890> where<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> stylus<00:03:14.150> goes<00:03:14.360> that's<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
here is where the stylus goes that's the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.100 
here is where the stylus goes that's the
stylus<00:03:15.350> holder<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.120> slot<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.630> where

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
stylus holder and in this slot is where

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.949 
stylus holder and in this slot is where
the<00:03:18.380> cartridge<00:03:18.860> goes<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:20.209> get<00:03:20.420> with<00:03:20.840> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
the cartridge goes and you get with the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.850 
the cartridge goes and you get with the
tablet<00:03:21.970> obviously<00:03:22.970> that's<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.620> stylus<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
tablet obviously that's the stylus and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:35.200 
tablet obviously that's the stylus and
you<00:03:25.489> get<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> cartridge<00:03:26.150> just

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.330 

and<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.780> stylist<00:03:37.230> basically<00:03:37.680> fits<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.160> right

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
and the stylist basically fits in right

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.660 
and the stylist basically fits in right
here<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:41.730> cartridge<00:03:43.130> basically<00:03:44.130> goes

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
here and this cartridge basically goes

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.250 
here and this cartridge basically goes
in<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.030> way<00:03:46.460> why<00:03:47.460> then<00:03:47.700> as<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.180> see<00:03:48.450> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
in this way why then as you can see it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.220 
in this way why then as you can see it
has<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:50.040> handle<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:51.450> flips<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.020> very

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
has this handle that flips and very

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.060 
has this handle that flips and very
nicely<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.270> actually<00:03:54.710> become<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:55.860> nice

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
nicely so you can actually become a nice

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.140 
nicely so you can actually become a nice
carry<00:03:56.460> case<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.180> portable<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.860> comes<00:03:59.490> with<00:03:59.760> a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
total of 18 free apps that's 15 I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.410

I'd<00:04:41.280> say<00:04:41.550> before<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.940> start<00:04:42.150> using<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
I'd say before you start using the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.090 
I'd say before you start using the
tablet<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.410> know<00:04:43.530> make<00:04:43.680> sure<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.920> you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
tablet you know make sure that you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.750 
tablet you know make sure that you
charge<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:45.140> initially<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:47.100> takes<00:04:47.340> about<00:04:47.460> four

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
charge it initially it takes about four

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.680 
charge it initially it takes about four
and<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.910> half<00:04:47.940> hours<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.890> charge<00:04:49.890> initially<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
and a half hours to charge initially the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.690 
and a half hours to charge initially the
bathroom<00:04:52.110> fully<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.250> battery<00:04:53.610> is

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
bathroom fully and the battery is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.290 
bathroom fully and the battery is
actually<00:04:54.090> as<00:04:54.390> opposed<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.590> earlier<00:04:56.300> model

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
actually as opposed to the earlier model

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.350 
actually as opposed to the earlier model
but<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.510> had<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.780> batteries<00:04:58.169> right<00:04:58.380> here

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
but you had the batteries right here

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.620 
but you had the batteries right here
this<00:05:00.360> battery<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:01.400> basically<00:05:02.400> inside<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.540> you

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
this battery is basically inside so you

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.980 
this battery is basically inside so you
cannot<00:05:03.840> remove<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.270> that's<00:05:06.690> pretty<00:05:06.900> much

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
cannot remove it so that's pretty much

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.400 
cannot remove it so that's pretty much
it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
it

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.590 
it
like<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.890> said<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.070> will<00:05:08.250> be<00:05:08.370> doing<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.940> more

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
like I said I will be doing a more
