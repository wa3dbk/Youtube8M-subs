winter<00:00:04.770> came<00:00:04.950> early<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.339> year<00:00:05.779> only<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.109> end

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
winter came early this year only the end

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.440 
winter came early this year only the end
of<00:00:07.350> October<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.280> already<00:00:08.700> were<00:00:08.970> getting<00:00:09.240> some

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
of October and already were getting some

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.259 
of October and already were getting some
snow<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.260> blowing<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.269> pretty

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
snow and it's blowing and it's pretty

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.930 
snow and it's blowing and it's pretty
cold<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.049> figured<00:00:13.080> I'd<00:00:13.830> come<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.280> start

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
cold out so I figured I'd come out start

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.900 
cold out so I figured I'd come out start
a<00:00:15.000> fire<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.570> wood<00:00:15.839> stone<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.730> start<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.789> new

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
a fire in the wood stone and start a new

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
a fire in the wood stone and start a new
project<00:00:18.150> I've<00:00:18.570> had<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> back<00:00:19.080> burner<00:00:19.350> let

it's<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.090> junk<00:00:58.340> now<00:00:59.340> most<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it's all going to be junk now most you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
it's all going to be junk now most you
might<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.570> thinking<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> throw<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
might be thinking well I throw a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
might be thinking well I throw a
brushless<00:01:02.670> motor<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.899> that'll<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.320> really

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
brushless motor in and that'll be really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
brushless motor in and that'll be really
cool<00:01:04.559> make<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.159> fast<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.930> heck<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
cool make it go fast but heck it's a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
cool make it go fast but heck it's a
snowmobile<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.330> should<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.510> either<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
snowmobile and should have either a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.750 
snowmobile and should have either a
two-stroke<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.799> particular<00:01:11.070> model

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
two-stroke for this particular model

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
two-stroke for this particular model
this<00:01:12.600> thing's<00:01:12.810> modeled<00:01:13.590> after<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.070> have

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this thing's modeled after would have

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 
this thing's modeled after would have
been<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> two-stroke<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> should

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
been a two-stroke so I think it should

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
been a two-stroke so I think it should
have<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> nitro<00:01:17.369> engine<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.320> now<00:01:20.299> whether<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
have a nitro engine in it now whether I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
have a nitro engine in it now whether I
can<00:01:21.540> fit<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.830> determined

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
can fit it or not is to be determined

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
can fit it or not is to be determined
and<00:01:23.850> whether<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.200> these

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and whether I you I don't know if these

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.539 
and whether I you I don't know if these
gears<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.799> hold<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.619> first

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
dremel cut it all out cut any posts that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.350 
dremel cut it all out cut any posts that
aren't<00:01:41.430> needed<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:45.030> existing

aren't needed out to see if an existing

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
aren't needed out to see if an existing
motor<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.020> already<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.979> older<00:01:47.340> trucks

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
motor will fit Matt if it will then I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.880 
motor will fit Matt if it will then I
got<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> figure<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> interface

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

between this driveshaft this gear and
the<00:01:56.520> motor<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:57.110> maybe<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.320> take<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.100> gear

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the motor now maybe you take this gear

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.870 
the motor now maybe you take this gear
off<00:02:00.229> mount<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.469> metal<00:02:01.770> gear<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.490> some

enough<00:02:10.610> torque<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.410> then<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:13.040> run<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> regular

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
enough torque and then I run a regular

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.870 
enough torque and then I run a regular
clutch<00:02:14.270> on<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> Nitro<00:02:15.050> motor<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.819> figure<00:02:16.819> it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
clutch on the Nitro motor and figure it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.180 
clutch on the Nitro motor and figure it
all<00:02:16.970> out<00:02:17.050> then<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> steering<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
all out then for the steering the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.800 
all out then for the steering the
steering<00:02:19.430> servo<00:02:19.700> will<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.120> sit<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> here

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
steering servo will just sit up in here

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.979 
steering servo will just sit up in here

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
this new raw it's going out replace

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.440 
this new raw it's going out replace

funny<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.709> look<00:02:51.830> at<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.700> 155<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
funny you look at this this to 155 and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.240 
funny you look at this this to 155 and
yeah<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.459> even<00:02:55.700> close<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.120> scale<00:02:57.250> but

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
yeah it's not even close to scale but

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.550 
yeah it's not even close to scale but
but<00:02:58.580> whatever<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.299> is<00:02:59.330> what<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.870> now<00:03:00.350> one

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
aluminum plates in there to hold it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.789 
aluminum plates in there to hold it
together<00:03:19.910> something<00:03:20.420> but<00:03:20.690> well<00:03:21.350> figure<00:03:21.709> it

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
together something but well figure it

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.470 
together something but well figure it
out<00:03:21.920> first<00:03:22.790> things<00:03:23.060> first

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
drama work making a mess I got it more

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.590 
drama work making a mess I got it more
or<00:03:35.900> less<00:03:35.930> cleaned<00:03:36.350> up<00:03:36.530> by<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.239> clean<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.390> up<00:03:38.510> a

or less cleaned up by and clean it up a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.710 
or less cleaned up by and clean it up a
little<00:03:38.720> bit<00:03:38.900> better<00:03:39.079> inside<00:03:39.590> once<00:03:39.950> I'm<00:03:40.720> ready

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
little bit better inside once I'm ready

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.410 
little bit better inside once I'm ready
to<00:03:41.989> permanently<00:03:42.620> mount<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.160> but<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.790> think<00:03:44.239> my

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
to permanently mount this but I think my

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.319 
to permanently mount this but I think my
plan<00:03:44.480> might<00:03:44.750> work<00:03:45.459> here's<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.730> engine<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.180> was

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
plan might work here's the engine I was

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.400 
plan might work here's the engine I was
thinking<00:03:47.660> they<00:03:47.750> using<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.680> torque<00:03:49.010> 16<00:03:50.410> came

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
thinking they using the torque 16 came

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.580 
thinking they using the torque 16 came
out<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:51.950> Duratrax<00:03:52.760> empty<00:03:53.630> truck<00:03:54.140> that<00:03:54.560> I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
out of that Duratrax empty truck that I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.229 
out of that Duratrax empty truck that I
haven't<00:03:54.739> used<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.310> while<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.760> good<00:03:56.000> little

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
haven't used in a while a good little

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.780 
haven't used in a while a good little
truck<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:56.980> we'll<00:03:57.980> see<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.370> may<00:03:58.489> sacrifice

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
truck but we'll see it may sacrifice

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.259 
truck but we'll see it may sacrifice
this<00:03:59.420> engine<00:03:59.780> for<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.049> cause<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.590> maybe<00:04:00.739> I'll

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
this engine for the cause and maybe I'll

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.630 
this engine for the cause and maybe I'll
do<00:04:02.269> some<00:04:02.569> searching<00:04:03.319> online<00:04:03.470> eBay<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.250> sort

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
do some searching online eBay that sort

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.699 
do some searching online eBay that sort
of<00:04:04.700> thing<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.060> find<00:04:05.299> something<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:06.290> might

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
of thing and find something that might

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.259 
of thing and find something that might
work<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.100> little<00:04:07.190> better<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.910> I'll<00:04:08.030> show<00:04:08.239> you

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
work a little better and I'll show you

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.570 
work a little better and I'll show you
why<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.600> say<00:04:08.750> might<00:04:09.140> work

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
why I say might work

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.670 
why I say might work
little<00:04:09.730> better<00:04:10.020> we've<00:04:11.020> already<00:04:11.200> kind<00:04:11.500> of

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
little better we've already kind of

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.320 
little better we've already kind of
rough<00:04:11.830> drop<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:15.010> does<00:04:15.730> fit<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
rough drop this in and it does fit and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.650 
rough drop this in and it does fit and
the<00:04:16.570> gears<00:04:16.870> would<00:04:17.200> line<00:04:17.470> up<00:04:18.060> pretty<00:04:19.060> good<00:04:19.299> here

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
the gears would line up pretty good here

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.900 
the gears would line up pretty good here

C<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.890> don't<00:04:23.890> know<00:04:24.100> where<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.700> single<00:04:24.970> speed

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
C I don't know where the single speed

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.930 
C I don't know where the single speed
one<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.780> but<00:04:26.140> looks<00:04:26.830> like<00:04:26.920> this<00:04:27.160> two<00:04:27.460> speed<00:04:27.760> one

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
one is but looks like this two speed one

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.430 
one is but looks like this two speed one
probably<00:04:28.330> all<00:04:28.510> right<00:04:28.750> we'll<00:04:29.050> give<00:04:29.170> me<00:04:29.290> that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
probably all right we'll give me that

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.960 
probably all right we'll give me that
extra<00:04:29.980> length<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> would<00:04:30.700> need<00:04:30.910> for

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
extra length that I would need for

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.350 
extra length that I would need for
things<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.660> line<00:04:31.900> up<00:04:32.430> but<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> couple<00:04:33.700> issues<00:04:34.210> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
things to line up but a couple issues to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.540 
things to line up but a couple issues to
overcome<00:04:34.390> one<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:37.450> pull<00:04:37.720> start<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:39.340> too

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
overcome one is the pull start it's too

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.690 
overcome one is the pull start it's too
big<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:43.210> pull<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.510> off<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.830> make<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.190> fit<00:04:45.430> so

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
big so to pull it off to make it fit so

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.070 
big so to pull it off to make it fit so
it<00:04:45.790> fits<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.180> there<00:04:46.390> just<00:04:46.720> bit<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.780> just

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
it fits in there just bit and it just

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.650 
it fits in there just bit and it just
clears<00:04:50.530> for<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.310> steering<00:04:51.700> shaft<00:04:51.730> go<00:04:52.300> through

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
clears for the steering shaft go through

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.080 
clears for the steering shaft go through
at<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.960> moment<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:54.400> alright<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:54.970> then

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
at the moment so that's alright and then

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.470 
at the moment so that's alright and then
the<00:04:55.330> clutch<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.000> clutch<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
the clutch are not the clutch the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.480 
the clutch are not the clutch the
flywheel<00:04:58.990> just<00:04:59.320> clears<00:04:59.650> here<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.340> would

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
flywheel just clears here so I would

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.880 
flywheel just clears here so I would
work<00:05:00.670> alright<00:05:01.980> but<00:05:03.720> cause<00:05:04.720> another<00:05:05.110> problem

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
work alright but cause another problem

work alright but cause another problem

that sorry cat you can see I'm going to

that sorry cat you can see I'm going to
have<00:06:25.380> some<00:06:25.650> clearance<00:06:26.099> issues<00:06:27.830> so<00:06:28.830> I<00:06:28.860> think<00:06:29.039> an

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
have some clearance issues so I think an

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.469 
have some clearance issues so I think an
ideal<00:06:30.440> situation<00:06:31.440> would<00:06:31.470> actually<00:06:32.099> be<00:06:32.479> to

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
ideal situation would actually be to

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.100 
ideal situation would actually be to
find<00:06:33.780> a<00:06:33.900> rear<00:06:34.169> port<00:06:35.120> engine<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.300> think<00:06:36.960> the

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
find a rear port engine I think the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.779 
find a rear port engine I think the
Traxxas<00:06:37.650> ones<00:06:37.860> are<00:06:38.069> like<00:06:38.250> that<00:06:38.550> and<00:06:40.789> hopefully

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
Traxxas ones are like that and hopefully

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.990 
Traxxas ones are like that and hopefully
some<00:06:42.120> with<00:06:42.240> a<00:06:42.330> little<00:06:42.570> bit<00:06:42.690> longer<00:06:43.580> clutch<00:06:44.580> but

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
some with a little bit longer clutch but

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.350 
some with a little bit longer clutch but
work<00:06:45.419> with<00:06:45.630> that<00:06:45.810> I<00:06:45.840> had<00:06:46.199> to<00:06:47.150> it's<00:06:48.150> got<00:06:48.330> a

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
work with that I had to it's got a

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.060 
work with that I had to it's got a
pretty<00:06:48.539> big<00:06:48.750> flywheel<00:06:49.289> so<00:06:49.560> maybe<00:06:49.740> some<00:06:49.949> of<00:06:50.009> the

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
pretty big flywheel so maybe some of the

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.189 
pretty big flywheel so maybe some of the
other<00:06:50.190> engines<00:06:50.520> have<00:06:50.699> a<00:06:50.759> smaller<00:06:51.030> flywheel<00:06:51.630> I

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
other engines have a smaller flywheel I

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.990 
other engines have a smaller flywheel I
think<00:06:52.710> the<00:06:52.800> best<00:06:52.979> bet<00:06:53.130> I<00:06:53.520> don't<00:06:53.639> necessarily

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
think the best bet I don't necessarily

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.270 
think the best bet I don't necessarily
want<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:54.449> ruin<00:06:54.660> this<00:06:54.840> engine<00:06:55.320> so<00:06:55.830> I<00:06:55.860> want<00:06:56.220> to

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
want to ruin this engine so I want to

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
want to ruin this engine so I want to
get<00:06:56.370> that<00:06:56.550> other<00:06:56.639> truck<00:06:56.910> going<00:06:57.710> find<00:06:58.710> a<00:06:58.860> rear

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
get that other truck going find a rear

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.159 
get that other truck going find a rear
flywheel<00:07:00.300> a<00:07:00.599> rear<00:07:00.960> exhaust<00:07:01.320> port<00:07:02.630> so<00:07:03.630> cheap<00:07:03.870> or

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
flywheel a rear exhaust port so cheap or

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.620 
flywheel a rear exhaust port so cheap or
somewhere<00:07:04.470> on<00:07:04.590> eBay<00:07:04.889> and<00:07:05.099> work<00:07:05.250> that<00:07:05.520> I<00:07:05.909> could

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
somewhere on eBay and work that I could

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.339 
somewhere on eBay and work that I could
gain<00:07:06.990> some<00:07:07.020> clearance<00:07:07.650> by<00:07:08.389> cutting<00:07:09.389> off<00:07:09.569> one

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
gain some clearance by cutting off one

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:12.020 
gain some clearance by cutting off one
of<00:07:10.380> these<00:07:10.500> cooling<00:07:10.800> fins<00:07:11.159> being<00:07:11.520> enough<00:07:11.669> to<00:07:11.909> be

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
of these cooling fins being enough to be

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.640 
of these cooling fins being enough to be
a<00:07:12.060> winter<00:07:12.300> vehicle<00:07:12.870> I<00:07:12.930> don't<00:07:13.110> think<00:07:13.289> enough<00:07:13.500> to

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
a winter vehicle I don't think enough to

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.399 
a winter vehicle I don't think enough to
worry<00:07:13.800> about<00:07:13.830> cooling<00:07:14.400> as<00:07:14.550> long<00:07:14.789> as<00:07:14.970> I<00:07:15.289> open<00:07:16.289> up

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409 
worry about cooling as long as I open up

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:22.879 
worry about cooling as long as I open up
the<00:07:16.560> hood<00:07:16.740> for<00:07:17.009> some<00:07:17.250> cooling<00:07:17.729> air<00:07:19.099> so<00:07:20.099> I<00:07:21.889> think

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
the hood for some cooling air so I think

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.170 
the hood for some cooling air so I think
I'm<00:07:23.130> going<00:07:23.340> to<00:07:24.590> shut<00:07:25.590> her<00:07:25.710> down<00:07:25.889> for<00:07:26.340> now<00:07:26.729> and

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
I'm going to shut her down for now and

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.930 
I'm going to shut her down for now and
go<00:07:27.389> look<00:07:27.659> on<00:07:27.840> eBay<00:07:28.229> and<00:07:28.590> just<00:07:28.860> do<00:07:29.669> some

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 
go look on eBay and just do some

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.320 
go look on eBay and just do some
research<00:07:30.479> and<00:07:30.690> see<00:07:30.780> what<00:07:30.990> I<00:07:31.080> can<00:07:31.139> find<00:07:31.620> I'll

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
research and see what I can find I'll

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.939 
research and see what I can find I'll
give<00:07:33.330> you<00:07:33.479> an<00:07:33.630> update<00:07:34.020> as<00:07:34.229> soon<00:07:34.289> as<00:07:34.560> I<00:07:34.680> have
