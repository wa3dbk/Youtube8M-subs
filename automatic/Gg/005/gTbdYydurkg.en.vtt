00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.780
 there is his tonight 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.950
 gymnastic exercises on a galloping horse to step out of place 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.650
 the intention is that the exercises and with the record label and not too 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.840
 restart device that is defective and use the horse as one 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.710
 touches and not that the device was very important 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.679
 those metastases can be compared because of course it is a lot 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.789
 exercises that result from hans aunt and that they do such things 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.150
 only you in is of course a physics horse the most important thing 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.960
 it always remains important that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.240
 we think it's actually the best amersfoort the real equestrian sport is that 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.149
 there with a delicious 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.190
 but it happens in it too much depending on the horse yes in it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 incident a dining room together and that makes it a lot of fun 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.270
 by now fluttering like a star it can be very scary that you march it 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.540
 Do it together and do so from many women who are also on the ground 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.970
 show 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.370
 that is not so bad on a horse 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.970
 yes i can tell you in advance that it was a joke a statement from the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.090
 bus 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.039
 just after being from abroad 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.830
 and the exercises meant first and foremost alms to be practiced 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 otherwise tell the real horse that we first know for sure that we 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.540
 be able to perform the exercises well and only then will they do the real pair 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 and then first step after that I was up 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 woerden 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.050
 another important condition for being natural yes being one 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.610
 be in the news again 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.150
 and much more familiarity plus that ioc valves get better performance with 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.630
 the best performance and three are caught up in the gym at the medals 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690
 becomes master attentive 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.740
 I myself have made a global player I am currently present in 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.080
 America 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 and that says South counts wanting to experience a year already 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.529
 I hope the Olympic sport is time that would be a lot of fun 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.709
 of course it never was 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.149
 we hope to know that already 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.149
 again that could be that we are very nice he says 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.120
 being
