time<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:59.870> would<00:03:00.870> still<00:03:01.109> consider<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.709> a

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
time I would still consider that a

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.860 
time I would still consider that a
possible<00:03:02.730> SIDS<00:03:03.209> risk<00:03:04.250> because<00:03:05.750> even<00:03:06.750> though

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
possible SIDS risk because even though

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.210 
possible SIDS risk because even though
it<00:03:06.989> fell<00:03:07.200> curved<00:03:07.409> down<00:03:07.620> that's<00:03:07.950> something

it fell curved down that's something

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.839 
it fell curved down that's something
