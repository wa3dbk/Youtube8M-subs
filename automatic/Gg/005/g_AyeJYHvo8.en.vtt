00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
notes i guess on a really easy way to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.290 
notes i guess on a really easy way to
put<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> piston<00:00:11.490> back<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.120> cylinder

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
put the piston back in the cylinder

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.430 
put the piston back in the cylinder
reassemble<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.340> without<00:00:14.340> having<00:00:14.610> taken<00:00:14.820> the

piston in the cylinder with the rings
one<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.599> Rotax<00:00:28.050> came<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
one by one and Rotax came up with this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
one by one and Rotax came up with this
tool<00:00:29.939> piston<00:00:30.750> ring<00:00:30.900> spanner<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.529> looks

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
tool piston ring spanner which looks

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.680 
tool piston ring spanner which looks
like<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.820> been<00:00:32.910> honed<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:33.600> old

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
like it's been honed out of an old

thin and smooth in the middle at the
bottom<00:00:42.860> lightly<00:00:43.860> oiled<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:46.500> well<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.800> that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
bottom lightly oiled it as well as that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.500 
bottom lightly oiled it as well as that
my<00:00:47.670> super<00:00:48.149> tools<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.280> local<00:00:50.280> timber<00:00:50.510> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
my super tools are a local timber and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
my super tools are a local timber and
the<00:00:52.410> hacksaw<00:00:52.590> blade<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:55.730> this<00:00:56.730> shows<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> how

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the hacksaw blade so this shows just how

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.479 
the hacksaw blade so this shows just how
simple<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:59.239> widen<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> piston<00:01:00.719> down

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
simple it is just widen the piston down

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
simple it is just widen the piston down
to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> bottom<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> oil<00:01:04.710> inside<00:01:06.140> con<00:01:07.140> or

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to the bottom like the oil inside con or

to the bottom like the oil inside con or
gap<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> back

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.280 

just<00:01:13.159> jiggle<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.810> that's<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.020> little

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just jiggle it on that's really little

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.710 
just jiggle it on that's really little

the<00:01:50.610> spanner<00:01:51.610> from<00:01:51.820> falling<00:01:52.270> into<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.630> engine

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
the spanner from falling into the engine

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.390 
the spanner from falling into the engine
case<00:01:53.500> makes<00:01:53.800> easier<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.370> retrieve<00:01:56.220> hand<00:01:57.220> on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
case makes easier to retrieve hand on

case makes easier to retrieve hand on
the<00:01:57.460> top<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.790> head<00:01:58.740> whined<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.860> piston<00:02:00.280> up

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the top of the head whined the piston up

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.609 
the top of the head whined the piston up
there

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.020 

and<00:02:08.890> voila<00:02:09.629> take<00:02:10.629> that<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:12.989> take<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.019> out

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and voila take that out take that out

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.160 
and voila take that out take that out
that's<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.860> exactly<00:02:18.370> how<00:02:19.150> easy<00:02:19.890> was<00:02:20.890> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's in just exactly how easy was that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900 
that's in just exactly how easy was that
for<00:02:23.170> your<00:02:23.290> information<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> 501<00:02:24.610> as<00:02:24.700> well

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
for your information is a 501 as well

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.789 
for your information is a 501 as well
these<00:02:25.209> are<00:02:25.360> quite<00:02:25.480> hard<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:25.959> now<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> 500

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
these are quite hard to get now the 500

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.089 
these are quite hard to get now the 500
runs<00:02:26.950> Rotax<00:02:27.580> don't<00:02:27.819> do<00:02:27.940> them<00:02:28.120> anymore<00:02:28.950> Nick<00:02:29.950> it

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
runs Rotax don't do them anymore Nick it

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.110 
runs Rotax don't do them anymore Nick it
forces<00:02:30.580> drop<00:02:30.790> some<00:02:31.030> maybe<00:02:31.660> LMS<00:02:32.940> these<00:02:33.940> are<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
forces drop some maybe LMS these are a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.369 
forces drop some maybe LMS these are a
little<00:02:34.209> bit<00:02:34.390> more<00:02:34.599> tricky<00:02:34.810> because<00:02:35.140> they

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
little bit more tricky because they

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.940 
little bit more tricky because they
won't<00:02:35.500> come<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.370> out<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:37.060> too<00:02:37.239> big<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.920> we

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
won't come in and out the too big so we

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.100 
won't come in and out the too big so we
have<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.370> with<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.640> he's<00:02:40.540> wound<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:43.110> there

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
have to do with that he's wound in there

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.280 
have to do with that he's wound in there
it<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.040> your<00:02:45.150> 500<00:02:46.150> engine<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:47.049> can<00:02:47.170> do

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it is so on your 500 engine you can do

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.910 
it is so on your 500 engine you can do
it<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.590> still<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.130> out<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.959> am<00:02:52.920> winding

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
it you can still get it out I am winding

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.849 
it you can still get it out I am winding
it<00:02:54.010> off<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.190> comm<00:02:54.370> mode<00:02:54.519> like<00:02:54.670> that
