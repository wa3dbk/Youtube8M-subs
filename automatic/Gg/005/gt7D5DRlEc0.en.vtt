00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
bed and but I'm very pleased I really

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
bed and but I'm very pleased I really
pleased<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.450> players<00:00:39.780> played

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
pleased with the way our players played

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.580 
pleased with the way our players played
and<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:41.790> beat<00:00:41.940> Miami<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.510> Miami<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> very

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and to beat Miami and Miami is a very

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
and to beat Miami and Miami is a very
difficult<00:00:43.829> assignment<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
difficult assignment I really think is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
difficult assignment I really think is
probably<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.960> toughest<00:00:46.320> assignment<00:00:46.920> we

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
probably the toughest assignment we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.279 
probably the toughest assignment we
could<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.309> drawn<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> any<00:00:48.180> Bowl<00:00:48.390> even

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
could have drawn in any Bowl even

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.430 
could have drawn in any Bowl even
tougher<00:00:49.649> than<00:00:49.770> Penn<00:00:50.039> State<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.489> Pasadena<00:00:51.180> or

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
tougher than Penn State at Pasadena or

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
tougher than Penn State at Pasadena or
Alabama<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.860> Florida<00:00:53.219> State<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.030> Florida<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Alabama or Florida State or Florida and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
Alabama or Florida State or Florida and
then<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> sugar<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
then and the sugar so you know I was I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.569 
then and the sugar so you know I was I
just<00:00:59.670> felt<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.570> could<00:01:00.780> stay<00:01:01.020> close<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
just felt if we could stay close and we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
just felt if we could stay close and we
had<00:01:02.699> worked<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.000> hard<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.629> practice<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:05.220> we

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
had worked so hard in practice that we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.620 
had worked so hard in practice that we
thought<00:01:05.549> our<00:01:05.729> strength<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> our<00:01:06.299> condition

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
thought our strength and our condition

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
thought our strength and our condition
would<00:01:06.990> maybe<00:01:07.140> take<00:01:07.409> hold<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> fourth

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
would maybe take hold in the fourth

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.469 
would maybe take hold in the fourth
quarter<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.670> talked<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> players<00:01:09.299> about

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
quarter we talked to the players about

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
quarter we talked to the players about
that<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.799> told<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> fourth<00:01:11.340> quarter

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that and we told in the fourth quarter

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
that and we told in the fourth quarter
be<00:01:11.790> ours<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> second<00:01:12.689> half<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.990> even

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
be ours and the second half we even

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
be ours and the second half we even
chose<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.420> defend<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.290> endzone<00:01:16.830> started

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
chose to to defend this endzone started

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.920 
chose to to defend this endzone started
half<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
half so we would have that one at the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
half so we would have that one at the
end<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> least<00:01:20.880> noisy<00:01:21.240> one

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
end because that was the least noisy one

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.210 
end because that was the least noisy one
we<00:01:22.049> figured<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> fourth<00:01:22.740> quarter<00:01:22.950> that's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
we figured in the fourth quarter that's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
we figured in the fourth quarter that's
where<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.580> were<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.150> score<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
where we were going to do our score and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200 
where we were going to do our score and
then<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> players<00:01:26.310> bought<00:01:27.000> into

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
then and I think the players bought into

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.630 
then and I think the players bought into
it<00:01:27.390> too<00:01:27.950> unfortunate<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.189> didn't<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it too unfortunate we just didn't do it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.069 
it too unfortunate we just didn't do it
in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> third<00:01:29.970> quarter<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.810> had<00:01:30.960> them

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
in the third quarter I think I had them

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
in the third quarter I think I had them
too<00:01:31.259> too<00:01:31.829> keyed<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> win<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
too too keyed in we're going to win it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.819 
too too keyed in we're going to win it
in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> forest<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.840> they<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.290> waited<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> do

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
in the forest so they they waited to do

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
in the forest so they they waited to do
it<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.210> anyway<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> great<00:01:36.990> team<00:01:37.170> when

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it but anyway it was a great team when

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
it but anyway it was a great team when
punting<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.159> our<00:01:38.460> stat<00:01:38.790> made<00:01:39.000> some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
punting was good our stat made some

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.990 
punting was good our stat made some
great<00:01:39.420> plays<00:01:39.770> defense<00:01:40.770> three<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.700> about

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
great plays defense three and out about

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
great plays defense three and out about
three<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.360> four<00:01:42.509> times<00:01:42.720> they're<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.350> fourth

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
three or four times they're in a fourth

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.649 
three or four times they're in a fourth
quarter<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> whole<00:01:45.630> deal

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
quarter which which was the whole deal

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.830 
quarter which which was the whole deal
and<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.890> offensively<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:48.329> things<00:01:48.570> going

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and then offensively we got things going

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.359 
and then offensively we got things going
I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.229> their<00:01:49.380> defense<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I think their defense was really kind of

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
I think their defense was really kind of
worn<00:01:50.549> down<00:01:50.759> toward<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> end<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.930> decision

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
worn down toward the end your decision

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
worn down toward the end your decision
to<00:01:52.950> continue<00:01:53.340> practice<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.360> interim<00:01:54.780> basis

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to continue practice on an interim basis

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
to continue practice on an interim basis
but<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> keep<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.700> through

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but to keep it going all the way through

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
but to keep it going all the way through
December<00:01:57.180> turned<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> exactly<00:01:58.590> what

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
December turned out to be exactly what

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.499 
December turned out to be exactly what
the<00:01:59.219> team<00:01:59.399> needed<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.090> tip-top

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the team needed to be in the tip-top

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
the team needed to be in the tip-top
condition<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.049> play<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.500> well<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
condition to play this game well it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
condition to play this game well it
seems<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.640> passing<00:02:03.119> teams<00:02:03.360> like

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and they can come back and be pretty

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.450 
and they can come back and be pretty
good<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.570> when<00:02:10.380> you're<00:02:10.500> doing<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> traps<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
good but when you're doing the traps and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.250 
good but when you're doing the traps and
the<00:02:11.580> counter<00:02:11.910> sweeps<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> options<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.200> a

the counter sweeps and the options and a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
lot of kind of things that are kind of

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.910 
lot of kind of things that are kind of
intricate<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.960> seems<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.500> lay<00:02:16.710> off<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
intricate it seems like that lay off a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
intricate it seems like that lay off a
couple<00:02:17.340> three<00:02:17.700> bowl<00:02:17.970> games<00:02:18.240> we<00:02:18.420> played<00:02:18.690> we

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
couple three bowl games we played we

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
couple three bowl games we played we
just<00:02:19.020> never<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.410> our<00:02:19.560> timing<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.400> we

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
just never got our timing back so we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.100 
just never got our timing back so we
decided<00:02:20.970> we'd<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.270> back<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.750> another<00:02:21.930> way

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
decided we'd go back to do another way

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
decided we'd go back to do another way
we<00:02:22.260> used<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> many<00:02:22.890> years<00:02:23.070> ago<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.610> never

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
we used to many years ago and just never

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210 
we used to many years ago and just never
quit<00:02:24.150> practicing<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.920> thought<00:02:26.070> our

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
quit practicing and and I thought our

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.650 
quit practicing and and I thought our
timing<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.640> better<00:02:26.940> than<00:02:27.120> it--<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.390> had<00:02:27.510> some

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
timing was better than it-- we had some

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.590 
timing was better than it-- we had some
doggone<00:02:27.990> turnovers<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.830> killed<00:02:29.130> us<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:30.209> if

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
doggone turnovers about killed us but if

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.120 
doggone turnovers about killed us but if
we<00:02:30.750> play<00:02:30.870> without<00:02:31.140> turnovers<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.860> probably

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
we play without turnovers we probably

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.060 
we play without turnovers we probably
win<00:02:32.400> pretty<00:02:32.610> good<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.209> we<00:02:33.450> might<00:02:33.660> win<00:02:33.959> by<00:02:34.140> 16

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
win pretty good here we might win by 16

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.430 
win pretty good here we might win by 16
