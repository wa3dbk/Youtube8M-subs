00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 moin moin and welcome here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.910
 i check for a new follow apple 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.350
 I am for apple eick tv and today 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.450
 I present you the elgato 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.450
 vanderbilt dog 2 have fun 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.300
 docking stations for laptops knows well 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 everyone 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
 As far as the macbooks are concerned, this is the offer 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 but very small 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 I personally already have a stand for that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.580
 macbook air seen where it is so across 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 can insert 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.280
 or for example try yourself sooner 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 times for my old 13 inch macbook with 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.110
 drive the so-called hentsch where 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.530
 I push hochkar enrolled the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 can 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.649
 and below virtually all the connections 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.450
 are predetermined 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.450
 I then turn only to the monitor 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 and other devices must connect and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 then there is just that with her elgato 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 van de pol pot is another 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.739
 I have technology 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.510
 here below 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.550
 I'll say a relatively small one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.629
 doc what i stand under my macbook stand 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 can push 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 and from there only one cable leads to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.150
 my macbook and that is hamburg 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 o2 cable the dock itself offers me 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.610
 here two usb 3.0 ports at the rear 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.490
 page 2 vanderbilt ports at the rear 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 side a hdmi-port a gigabit 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
 internet port and the stream port with the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.229
 I provide it with electricity 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.900
 I can only say that needs of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.729
 Panda bolt cable from dock to laptop and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.700
 the power cord so the normal 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 magsafe power cable for my macbook 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.369
 the front then we have a usb 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 3.0 port and a sound in and output 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.689
 the whole comes with an extra 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 the sound card really a sovereign 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.579
 sound can give to the processing 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 i just say that the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.090
 really desirable we have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 outside an aluminum housing which is the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 look of the macbook adapts to the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.030
 front so a plastic blind the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.320
 also excellent to my rest 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.049
 equipment fits you like her 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.930
 will see and the connections 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.310
 all firmly all very nicely attached 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.110
 means one has also partially such a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.920
 slightly smaller offset to the rear that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.360
 the stick is really stuck 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 really no points of criticism i will 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.959
 all now again to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.819
 build you show what I used here 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.410
 and then we'll take a look, I think 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.360
 right now the software 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.209
 and how the whole thing together 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.120
 works like this and here you see once 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 a close up of my treasuries 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 pending on the main macbooks I'm pushing 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.940
 Now down here just that bock 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.170
 and tries the plug so too 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.069
 that does not irritate that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.610
 necessarily too crazy here the hdmi 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.569
 Well, that's not quite clear now 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.450
 Well, the wobbler you have to 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.190
 excuse me as you said you see now 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.650
 here the thunderbolt but what left then 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.950
 also directly to the macbook leads four usb 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.569
 number one and then usb number two 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.750
 in the middle now remains a first 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.739
 panda bolt port free we supply 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.190
 right here and then the output 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.350
 for my boxes that have the stand here 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.720
 I would like to have it on the back 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.920
 but sometimes I shoot here 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.500
 forward on my headphones on 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.140
 so that's okay, too 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 Functionally so and last now 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 still my hard drive here to the knows 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.299
 you already from the review 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.239
 I'll try it all here now 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.070
 to plug in was relatively fast 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.950
 move straight and then come 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.380
 Now my macbook on it like that 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.180
 As it should be a moment I have to 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.180
 lift it over here for a moment 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.269
 and there it is already the whole 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.620
 stands relatively firmly on this stand 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.010
 now again the camera moves 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.739
 After nice to get out of here and me 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:57.690
 will just left here once zackzack 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.690
 put the whole thing in it 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.859
 and that's how it should work 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.829
 Here we have it ready 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.840
 structured setup here at the front again 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.459
 I just set the tone to the microphone 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 I hope that's just how it works 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.420
 all that a little 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.319
 make it clearer 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.030
 yes and then we are actually here 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.139
 already at the first part of the equipment 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.120
 tour but only for us 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.220
 here on this little village too 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.690
 restrict and now just seen 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.970
 how I connected the whole thing 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.060
 now also seen here on the left is ne 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.810
 box here my backup disk and stuff like that 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.330
 on and on 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.960
 but now it's about how it works 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.520
 dock, this works quasi this 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.690
 first installation of my equipment 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.130
 We can go into the software 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.979
 so we are here right now 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.720
 my 27 inch monitor is only here 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.610
 I have vacated it completely empty 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.220
 pushed everything on the other monitor 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.099
 we're looking up here 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.979
 the software that with the elgato investigator 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.440
 bulldog 2 is coming here, we see 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.370
 at the top of the bar once the symbol 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.400
 here 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.599
 I could do it all now 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.460
 from throwing but which we do not want 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.409
 because because my microphone is synonymous 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.320
 my two hard drives on it like you 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.050
 have seen and actually everything 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.880
 Here's how it works here 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.050
 down the utility end that 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 We do not want to because 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.669
 then i could do this simple function 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.800
 do not use the dock offers me and 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.990
 Although eject all at once 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.970
 I would not have had this function 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.860
 I now every two hard drives 1 1 off 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.659
 throw and so on and so forth 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.490
 but this software takes care of it 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.020
 that everything is safely ejected 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.580
 synonymous logic does not complain when I am 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.110
 so for example with my microphone 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.440
 record the sound and so on and so on 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.020
 on 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.830
 we are always very practical in the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.090
 attitude where they are relative 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.199
 unspectacular because here I can only 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.750
 set it to log on 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.530
 is started 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.270
 Here I can have more 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.660
 get information but then I end up 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.940
 in the web browser 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.300
 that was it so far already to the software we 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.800
 come now again to the conclusion 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.980
 after all, I can only say that 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.170
 lka meet underdog 2 an absolute 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.140
 perfect package is for me i had 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.360
 before a variant of kenzingen believe 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.390
 I have with usb 3.0 and the whole 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.940
 really pretty modest 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.580
 you can say that the picture works 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.110
 geruckelt the data transfer from 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.690
 hard disks and something was synonymous real 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.460
 not the fastest though three usb 3.0 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.530
 you have to say that 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.590
 here you can do that at all 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.230
 do not compare rank two goes off like 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.700
 nothing is unbelievable 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.290
 and then there is only one question for me 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.880
 at the end and where I said now 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.770
 I'm so happy with it 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.480
 do you want a complete 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.740
 equipment watch with all the drum and 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.200
 off that I also have a 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.690
 cable management show my boxes mine 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.250
 drive this and that and my micro and 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.930
 maybe even my camera depending on 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.870
 how you want to write that 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.920
 in the comments 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.690
 and that was it again 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.710
 I check with this apple follower I hope 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.810
 you liked it 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.760
 and if yes , there is a thumb 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.870
 high and likes to subscribe to the channel her 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.360
 can also recommend us 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.160
 because we can always get further out 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.840
 cut and can always get better products 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.520
 then we will get you a review for you 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.280
 I would like to be here 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.870
 once we announce in 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.220
 next time maybe if I have it 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.770
 I'll manage next week 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.169
 special and although there is every week 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.540
 video on a specific topic 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.280
 We will definitely see you friday 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.169
 next episode next until then remains 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.510
 off drop by our website 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:37.230
 and of course in our app I am 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.230
 Get out of here
