degrees<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:09.050> really<00:01:09.290> cold<00:01:09.500> out<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.310> type

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
degrees it's really cold out that type

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.460 
degrees it's really cold out that type
of<00:01:10.550> charge<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.030> uses<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.660> mode<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.320> lot

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
of charge it uses in that mode is a lot

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.990 
of charge it uses in that mode is a lot
easier<00:01:12.500> on<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.979> battery<00:01:13.340> when<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:13.910> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
easier on the battery when it's in the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.410 
easier on the battery when it's in the
cold<00:01:14.240> all<00:01:14.990> right<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:16.729> next<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.149> supply

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
cold all right the next is the supply

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.359 
cold all right the next is the supply
feature<00:01:17.720> which<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.170> really<00:01:18.440> cool<00:01:18.619> what<00:01:19.160> does

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
feature which is really cool what does

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.240 
feature which is really cool what does
it<00:01:19.520> puts<00:01:19.729> out<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.910> constant<00:01:20.390> 13<00:01:20.899> volts<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.160> you

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
it puts out a constant 13 volts so you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.040 
it puts out a constant 13 volts so you
can<00:01:22.369> actually<00:01:22.580> hook<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:23.570> up<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.899> your

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
can actually hook this up to your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.770 
can actually hook this up to your
vehicle<00:01:24.550> supply<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.610> vehicle<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.090> power<00:01:26.300> why

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
vehicle supply to vehicle of power why

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.300 
vehicle supply to vehicle of power why
you<00:01:26.840> take<00:01:27.110> out<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.380> battery<00:01:27.560> or<00:01:27.890> change<00:01:28.160> the

battery have a neat little system that
has<00:01:30.679> built<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:31.100> there<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.119> finally

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.580 

it<00:01:36.070> has<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.610> reconditioning<00:01:37.540> mode<00:01:37.780> basically

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
it has a reconditioning mode basically

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230 
it has a reconditioning mode basically
you<00:01:38.680> want<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.890> use<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.310> after<00:01:39.550> your<00:01:39.940> battery

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
you want to use that after your battery

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.210

is<00:01:40.360> fully<00:01:40.540> charged<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.560> really<00:01:41.800> good<00:01:41.950> use

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
is fully charged it's a really good use

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.980 
is fully charged it's a really good use
is<00:01:42.400> when<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.120> battery<00:01:43.360> or<00:01:43.720> like

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
is when you have a battery or like

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780 
is when you have a battery or like
deep-cycle<00:01:44.350> battery<00:01:44.830> that's<00:01:45.220> been<00:01:45.460> fully

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.670 
will demonstrate how to hook up to this
battery<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.750> first<00:01:56.080> off<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.440> going<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.620> be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
battery here first off is going to be

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.000 
battery here first off is going to be
black<00:01:57.280> negative<00:01:58.620> red<00:01:59.620> to<00:01:59.710> positive<00:02:01.080> okay<00:02:02.080> then

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
black negative red to positive okay then

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.370 
black negative red to positive okay then
we'll<00:02:03.130> do<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.490> go<00:02:03.610> ahead<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.780> port<00:02:05.080> here

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
we'll do is go ahead and just port here

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.010 
we'll do is go ahead and just port here
will<00:02:05.740> connect<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> port<00:02:06.640> from<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.600> CTEK

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
will connect to the port from the CTEK

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.700 
will connect to the port from the CTEK
charger<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.700> snaps<00:02:09.970> together<00:02:10.149> like<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
charger just snaps together like so

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.170 
charger just snaps together like so
alright<00:02:11.710> we<00:02:11.770> got<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:11.980> hooked<00:02:12.160> up<00:02:12.370> finally

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
alright we got it hooked up finally

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.000 
alright we got it hooked up finally
we'll<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.540> ahead<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.840> plug<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.350> our<00:02:14.470> 110

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
we'll go ahead and plug it to our 110

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.280 
we'll go ahead and plug it to our 110
outlet<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.580> then<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> regular

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
outlet and then this is a regular

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.720 
outlet and then this is a regular
maintenance<00:02:17.500> free<00:02:17.770> battery<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.520> we'll<00:02:18.640> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
maintenance free battery so we'll just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.980 
maintenance free battery so we'll just
go<00:02:18.850> ahead<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.120> switch<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> normal

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
go ahead and switch it to the normal

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.190 
go ahead and switch it to the normal
mode<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.380> as<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.070> see<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.780> blinking

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
mode and as you see here it's blinking

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080 
mode and as you see here it's blinking
right<00:02:23.770> now<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.950> charger<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.520> desulfation

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
right now the charger is in desulfation

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.260 
right now the charger is in desulfation
mode<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.610> means<00:02:27.820> it's<00:02:28.030> getting<00:02:28.210> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
mode so that means it's getting the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.650 
mode so that means it's getting the
battery<00:02:28.480> ready<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.320> charge

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
battery ready to charge

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.420 
battery ready to charge
after<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.080> will<00:02:32.140> call<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.800> soft<00:02:33.070> charge

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
after that it will call a soft charge

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180 
after that it will call a soft charge
and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.380> will<00:02:35.470> work<00:02:35.590> its<00:02:35.770> way<00:02:35.800> up<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.100> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
and then it will work its way up to the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
and then it will work its way up to the
bolt<00:02:36.370> charge<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.780> what's<00:02:37.990> called

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
bolt charge and then what's called

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.920 
bolt charge and then what's called
absorption<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:40.120> will<00:02:40.270> top<00:02:40.540> off<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
absorption which will top off the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.199 
absorption which will top off the
battery<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.310> then<00:02:42.580> I'll<00:02:42.670> analyze<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
battery and then I'll analyze the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.120 
battery and then I'll analyze the
condition<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.780> battery<00:02:43.930> oil<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.800> next

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
condition of the battery oil do next

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.310 
condition of the battery oil do next
it'll<00:02:45.730> go<00:02:45.880> ahead<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.510> float<00:02:46.840> mode<00:02:47.020> and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
it'll go ahead and go to float mode and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.190 
it'll go ahead and go to float mode and
then<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.459> top<00:02:48.880> off<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.180> battery<00:02:49.510> maintain<00:02:50.050> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
then to top off the battery maintain it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.410 
then to top off the battery maintain it
and<00:02:50.350> then<00:02:51.070> after<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.910> left<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.209> storage

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and then after that it's left in storage

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
and then after that it's left in storage
leave<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.290> there<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.650> leave<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.950> on<00:02:53.980> there

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
leave it on there you leave it on there

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.100 
leave it on there you leave it on there

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.460 
voltage in the battery it's easy to get
in<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.390> hurry<00:03:01.510> make<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.780> mistake<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.320> could

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
in a hurry make a mistake you could

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.860 
in a hurry make a mistake you could
easily<00:03:02.790> put<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.880> red<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.120> black<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.540> black<00:03:04.690> to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
easily put the red to black and black to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.510 
easily put the red to black and black to
red<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.620> what<00:03:05.739> happens<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.190> charger

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
red and what happens is the charger

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.580 
red and what happens is the charger
smart<00:03:06.850> enough<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.270> know<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> condition<00:03:08.380> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
smart enough to know that condition and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.350 
smart enough to know that condition and
lurch<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.400> but<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.030> doesn't<00:03:10.150> allow

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
lurch it to it but it doesn't allow

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.410 
lurch it to it but it doesn't allow
anything<00:03:10.660> short<00:03:11.080> out<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.590> you're<00:03:11.709> still<00:03:12.040> safe

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
anything short out so you're still safe

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.360 
anything short out so you're still safe
alright<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.570> typical<00:03:13.989> application<00:03:14.560> you're

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
alright in typical application you're

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.710 
alright in typical application you're
going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.550> change<00:03:15.730> out<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.000> battery<00:03:16.360> you're

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
going to change out the battery you're

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.170 
going to change out the battery you're
going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> go<00:03:16.989> ahead<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.910> undo<00:03:18.910> your

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
going to go ahead and undo your

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.420 
going to go ahead and undo your
terminals

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
terminals

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.399 
terminals
and<00:03:22.150> then<00:03:22.569> your<00:03:22.689> radio<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.170> lose<00:03:23.290> all

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
and then your radio is going to lose all

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.339 
and then your radio is going to lose all
presets<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.569> have<00:03:25.689> to<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.840> back<00:03:26.049> fix

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
presets in it so you have to go back fix

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.460 
presets in it so you have to go back fix
all<00:03:26.439> your<00:03:26.500> presets<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.069> all<00:03:27.189> that<00:03:27.340> stuff<00:03:27.579> so

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
all your presets and all that stuff so

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.140 
all your presets and all that stuff so
there's<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.560> way<00:03:29.709> around<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:30.129> with<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> charger

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
there's a way around it with the charger

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.800 
there's a way around it with the charger
in<00:03:31.299> supply<00:03:32.140> mode<00:03:32.379> what<00:03:32.799> we<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:34.629> go<00:03:34.780> back

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
in supply mode what we can do is go back

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:45.370 
in supply mode what we can do is go back
and<00:03:36.510> put<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.569> our<00:03:37.629> charger<00:03:39.689> loosen<00:03:40.689> up

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.540 

this<00:03:46.380> could<00:03:46.530> also<00:03:46.650> go<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.920> different<00:03:47.250> ground

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
this could also go to a different ground

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.500 
this could also go to a different ground
on<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> vehicle<00:03:48.090> also<00:03:49.910> go<00:03:50.910> ahead<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:53.510> loosen
