I'd like to talk about that and it's the

better<00:01:13.890> than<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.400> basically<00:01:15.000> what

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
better than I can but basically what

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
better than I can but basically what
it's<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.580> first<00:01:17.970> minute<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it's about is that that first minute you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's about is that that first minute you
have<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.210> incapacitation<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:22.020> falling

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have this incapacitation from falling

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
have this incapacitation from falling
into<00:01:22.799> cold<00:01:23.100> water<00:01:23.189> cold<00:01:23.970> water<00:01:24.060> shock<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
into cold water cold water shock and you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.840 
into cold water cold water shock and you
need<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> spend<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.369> minute<00:01:26.700> getting

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
need to spend that first minute getting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.539 
need to spend that first minute getting
your<00:01:27.060> breathing<00:01:27.810> under<00:01:27.930> control<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.340> can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
your breathing under control you can

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
your breathing under control you can
breathe<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.240> mile<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.020> minute<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> tell

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
breathe a mile a minute you have to tell

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
breathe a mile a minute you have to tell
yourself<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> under

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
yourself you just need to get it under

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.520 
yourself you just need to get it under
control<00:01:34.680> you've<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.670> minute<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
control you've got one minute to do that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
control you've got one minute to do that
then<00:01:37.530> you've<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.369> about<00:01:38.610> 10<00:01:39.030> minutes<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.630> get

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
then you've got about 10 minutes to get

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.170 
then you've got about 10 minutes to get
out<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> water<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:41.369> best<00:01:41.640> bet<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
out of the water and your best bet is to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
out of the water and your best bet is to
get<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> longer<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
get out right now because the longer you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.420 
get out right now because the longer you
stay<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> water<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.979> more<00:01:46.979> you're<00:01:47.280> going

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
stay in that water the more you're going

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.609 
stay in that water the more you're going
to<00:01:47.579> experience<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.420> failure<00:01:48.750> due<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to experience one failure due to the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.999 
to experience one failure due to the
neuromuscular<00:01:50.340> cooling<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> anything

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
neuromuscular cooling and so anything

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
neuromuscular cooling and so anything
that<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.670> immediately<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.630> out

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that you can do immediately to get out

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
that you can do immediately to get out
give<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.290> best<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:56.040> away<00:01:56.310> because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
give it your best right away because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
give it your best right away because
it's<00:01:56.700> only<00:01:56.850> gonna<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.210> worse<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> 1

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's only gonna get worse and then the 1

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.380 
it's only gonna get worse and then the 1
