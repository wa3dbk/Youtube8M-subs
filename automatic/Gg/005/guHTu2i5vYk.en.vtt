00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.490
 to proceed to a boxing 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.520
 the content of the box we see that it is very 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 simple since it only brings us a mouse 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.390
 we will teach 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.740

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 in terms of specifications it brings a 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.030
 optical sensor 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.610
 It has six keys

 the change of country between 400 and 800 1,600 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.110
 the flight 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.450
 We plug the mouse to see that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.030
 depending on each country level 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.299
 we will have a different color between 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 very well we will light the light so that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.280
