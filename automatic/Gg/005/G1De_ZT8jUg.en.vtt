all the chances that you want to happen
the<00:01:32.640> most<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.570> volcano<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.409> set<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the most so volcano is actually set to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
the most so volcano is actually set to
zero<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.130> no<00:01:35.250> volcanoes<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.420> spawn

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
zero so no volcanoes will actually spawn

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.090 
zero so no volcanoes will actually spawn
in<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> map<00:01:37.170> unless<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.650> change<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
in the map unless you change this

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
setting so other than that guys this is
exactly<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.790> to
