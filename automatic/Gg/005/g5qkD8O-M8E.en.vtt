today<00:00:00.450> I've<00:00:00.659> got<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:01.070> vintage

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
today I've got this vintage

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.120 
today I've got this vintage
cushion-shaped<00:00:03.600> watch<00:00:04.230> that's<00:00:04.620> coming<00:00:04.950> for

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
cushion-shaped watch that's coming for

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.200 
cushion-shaped watch that's coming for
repair<00:00:05.490> or<00:00:06.230> for<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> service<00:00:07.910> but<00:00:08.910> I've<00:00:09.030> seen

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
repair or for a service but I've seen

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.320 
repair or for a service but I've seen
that<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.510> lug<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.929> broken<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.099> first<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.000> have

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that the lug is broken so first I have

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.450 
that the lug is broken so first I have
to<00:00:12.480> repair<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.990> now<00:00:13.530> luckily<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
to repair that now luckily this is a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.369 
to repair that now luckily this is a
gold<00:00:15.030> case<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> fairly

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
gold case and so is fairly

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.519 
gold case and so is fairly
straightforward<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.220> repair<00:00:18.210> if<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
straightforward to repair if it was a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.720 
straightforward to repair if it was a
gold-plated

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
gold-plated

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
gold-plated
case<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:22.320> brass<00:00:23.279> based<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.029> example<00:00:24.260> then<00:00:25.260> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
case a brass based for example then I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
case a brass based for example then I
would<00:00:25.859> rather<00:00:26.039> send<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> professional

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
would rather send it to a professional

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.429 
would rather send it to a professional
case<00:00:27.930> refinisher<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> gold<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
case refinisher but this is gold and I

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.610 
case refinisher but this is gold and I
can<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.870> solder<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.020> back<00:00:34.230> together<00:00:36.620> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
can just solder this back together so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
can just solder this back together so
I'm<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> start<00:00:39.059> by<00:00:39.210> removing<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.989> watch

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm going to start by removing the watch

00:00:40.110 --> 00:01:22.320 
I'm going to start by removing the watch
on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.350> case

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.790 

I'm<00:01:23.330> going<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.659> take<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.930> glass<00:01:24.170> out<00:01:24.409> as<00:01:24.620> well

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
I'm going to take the glass out as well

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.330 
I'm going to take the glass out as well
and<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.380> need<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.680> take<00:01:27.890> off<00:01:28.100> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and then I just need to take off the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
and then I just need to take off the
watch<00:01:29.000> strap

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.090 

and<00:01:44.039> before<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> solder<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
and before I solder I'm just going to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
and before I solder I'm just going to
make<00:01:47.100> sure<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.640> ends<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.390> nice<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
make sure that the ends are nice and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010 
make sure that the ends are nice and
clean<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.469> just<00:01:50.250> using<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.759> fine<00:01:51.030> file<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
clean and just using a very fine file to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.690 
clean and just using a very fine file to
do<00:01:52.170> that

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.050 

I'll<00:02:02.119> make<00:02:02.360> sure<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.689> two<00:02:02.899> surfaces<00:02:03.649> mate

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
I'll make sure the two surfaces mate

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.929 
I'll make sure the two surfaces mate
correctly<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.979> nice<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.369> flush<00:02:07.549> with<00:02:07.729> each

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
correctly and a nice and flush with each

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:17.860 
correctly and a nice and flush with each
other<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.050> give<00:02:15.200> some<00:02:15.470> gold<00:02:16.870> solder

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
other I'm going to give some gold solder

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.550 
other I'm going to give some gold solder
paste<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> 9<00:02:20.390> karat<00:02:20.750> gold<00:02:20.930> case<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
paste and this is a 9 karat gold case so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
paste and this is a 9 karat gold case so
I'm<00:02:21.650> using<00:02:21.830> nine<00:02:22.160> karat<00:02:22.519> gold<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.599> is

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I'm using nine karat gold and this is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:33.130 
I'm using nine karat gold and this is
pre<00:02:24.019> fluxed

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.120 

very<00:02:33.770> handy<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.310> work<00:02:34.490> with<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.000> stuff<00:02:39.130> so

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
very handy to work with this stuff so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.340 
very handy to work with this stuff so
I'm<00:02:40.220> using<00:02:40.460> my<00:02:40.670> flame<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:44.050> never<00:02:45.050> applied

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
I'm using my flame here I never applied

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.780 
I'm using my flame here I never applied
the<00:02:45.620> flame<00:02:45.890> directly<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.990> solder<00:02:47.990> and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
the flame directly to the solder and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.140 
the flame directly to the solder and
what<00:02:49.790> what<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.270> like<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.960> just<00:02:52.150> tickle

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
what what I like to do is just tickle

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.080 
what what I like to do is just tickle
the<00:02:53.240> flame<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.900> fro<00:02:54.250> around<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.730> area

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the flame to and fro around the area

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.170 
the flame to and fro around the area
just<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> heat<00:02:57.410> up<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.740> general<00:02:58.040> area<00:02:58.460> first

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
just to heat up the general area first

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.710 
just to heat up the general area first
and<00:02:59.480> the<00:03:00.200> solder<00:03:00.560> will<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:02.240> metal<00:03:02.570> will

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
and the solder will the metal will

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.540 
and the solder will the metal will
eventually<00:03:03.230> get<00:03:03.380> hot<00:03:03.590> enough<00:03:03.860> for<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.100> solder

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
eventually get hot enough for the solder

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:21.980 
eventually get hot enough for the solder
to<00:03:04.700> melt<00:03:05.260> into<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> gap

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.160 

I<00:03:22.880> have<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> quick<00:03:24.210> look<00:03:24.390> underneath<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:25.020> make

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I have a quick look underneath to make

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.920 
I have a quick look underneath to make
sure<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> solder<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.010> flowed<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.810> way

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
sure the solder is flowed all the way

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.410 
sure the solder is flowed all the way
through

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.590 

now<00:03:36.990> I'm<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.260> use<00:03:37.440> some<00:03:37.650> safety<00:03:37.980> pickle

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
now I'm going to use some safety pickle

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.860 
now I'm going to use some safety pickle
this<00:03:39.600> will<00:03:39.750> remove<00:03:40.020> all<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.850> blackened<00:03:41.870> part

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
this will remove all the blackened part

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.840 
this will remove all the blackened part
of<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.170> metal<00:03:43.500> or<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.950> carbon<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:44.610> built

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
of the metal or the carbon that's built

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.830 
of the metal or the carbon that's built
up<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> metal<00:03:47.310> I'll<00:03:48.150> leave<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.660> there

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
up on the metal I'll leave that in there

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.870 
up on the metal I'll leave that in there
to<00:03:48.959> soak<00:03:51.830> I'll<00:03:52.830> soak<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.459> about<00:03:53.640> 10

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
to soak I'll soak that for about 10

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.620 
to soak I'll soak that for about 10
minutes

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.330 

our<00:04:03.470> safety<00:04:03.770> pickles<00:04:04.310> an<00:04:04.460> acid<00:04:04.820> or<00:04:06.340> quite

corrosive so I'm going to put on some

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.500 
corrosive so I'm going to put on some
gloves<00:04:10.040> here<00:04:12.340> just<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:13.460> case<00:04:13.490> any<00:04:13.880> splashes<00:04:14.390> on

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:52.180 
file to get inside and remove any
potentially<00:05:45.100> sharp<00:05:45.400> edges

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.980 

I'll<00:05:52.490> give<00:05:52.700> that<00:05:52.730> a<00:05:52.910> quick<00:05:53.120> buff<00:05:53.540> and<00:05:53.750> polish
