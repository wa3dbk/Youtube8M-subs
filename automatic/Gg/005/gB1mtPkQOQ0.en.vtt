 [Music] 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.500
 crazy who walks are welcome to this 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.270
 what to get style 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.320
 I am jose rainer and good as you can 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.660
 see today I'm pretty 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.220
 cleared and the hair is already 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.110
 because I'm going to show you how to give it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 volume to your hair as you can see my 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.560
 Hair like this is normally after 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 bathing is really dry and go no 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.880
 they have no volume and many have 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.739
 been wondering how thick for 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.540
 give them effect of my hair then the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.690
 first step is to have the hair a little 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.970
 dry then use this product that is 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.720
 mus 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.720
 and we are going to apply 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.690
 a small pump and we offer it for 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.690
 all our hair 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.780
 and what caused it to achieve is that it's going 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.820
 to give more foundation will give us more 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 stability when combing it and that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.910
 it is easier to control the following 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.470
 What are we going to do? 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.510
 heat in our hair with a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 dryer and what the heat does is that 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.350
 will give us the volume that we need 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.300
 because they are going to heat the hair is passed 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.710
 fluff up so to speak and something more than 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.750
 let's use is going to be this kind of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.310
 brush that we will use it for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.140
 give more volume towards the part 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.550
 top of our hair second penalty 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.940
 that you have lebanon that will be the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.940
 shape 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.549

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.230
 [Music] 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.480
 As we can see, we gave it enough 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.310
 volume to our hair the solution of 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.350
 these three techniques that is the mousse 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 classic ball and the brush shaping it 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.620
 to the hairstyles and good now that they have 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.300
 the volume they are looking for will apply a 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 little of it will be short of hair for 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.540
 give shape to the hairstyle that you 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.260
 like then he came to take nothing else 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.520
 a wax finger to comb my hair and 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.520
 give it the shape that I like 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.090
 and well that 's my period already finished 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.650
 with the 1 that I like as they can 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720
 see if we compare it with the start of the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.450
 video had all the hair down 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.070
 and we have nothing then this is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.540
 very good technique to give the volume 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.100
 that you want and leave have to open 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.380

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.270
