00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
time using Holloway we ever but I really

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.879 
time using Holloway we ever but I really
liked<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.139> I'm<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> start<00:00:13.530> using<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
liked it so I'm going to start using it

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.290 
liked it so I'm going to start using it
more<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.910> got<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> figure

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
more so you see here you got to figure

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.910 
more so you see here you got to figure
out<00:00:18.420> where<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.779> big<00:00:18.990> bombs<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.770> could

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
out where the big bombs are they could

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
out where the big bombs are they could
be<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.130> between<00:00:20.340> either<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:21.060> those<00:00:21.240> wizard

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
be in between either of those wizard

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
be in between either of those wizard
towers<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> Archer<00:00:23.880> tower<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.869> really

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
towers and Archer tower so it's really

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
towers and Archer tower so it's really
hard<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.769> tell<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:27.980> from<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.130> had<00:00:29.340> seen

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
hard to tell but from what had seen

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.669 
hard to tell but from what had seen
online<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.480> thought<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.960> were<00:00:31.019> probably<00:00:31.349> on

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
online I thought they were probably on

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.729 
online I thought they were probably on
the<00:00:31.920> northwest<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> southeast<00:00:33.410> due<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> how

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the northwest and southeast due to how

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.299 
the northwest and southeast due to how
his<00:00:35.510> 80s<00:00:36.510> were<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:37.140> wanted<00:00:37.410> me<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> come<00:00:38.100> from

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
his 80s were he wanted me to come from

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.610 
his 80s were he wanted me to come from
where<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> ideas<00:00:38.940> weren't<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:42.559> pulled<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
where the ideas weren't so I pulled the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
where the ideas weren't so I pulled the
CC<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> army<00:00:44.910> camp<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> then

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
CC over there to the army camp and then

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
CC over there to the army camp and then
I'll<00:00:46.260> take<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> archer<00:00:46.950> queen<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.309> my

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I'll take out the archer queen with my

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.180 
I'll take out the archer queen with my
Archer<00:00:47.850> Queen<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:49.079> send<00:00:49.289> my<00:00:49.379> hogs<00:00:49.680> from<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
Archer Queen and I send my hogs from the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.779 
Archer Queen and I send my hogs from the
southwest<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:52.219> they<00:00:53.219> clean<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.489> those

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
southwest and they clean up those

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
southwest and they clean up those
differences<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.079> can't<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.649> with

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
differences that I can't get with

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
differences that I can't get with
balloons<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.670> uh<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> only

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
balloons because uh you know you only

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
balloons because uh you know you only
have<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.680> 20<00:00:59.070> balloons<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have about 20 balloons and then I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
have about 20 balloons and then I
brought<00:01:00.090> 18<00:01:00.570> hogs<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.890> after<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> they

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
brought 18 hogs and then after that they

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
brought 18 hogs and then after that they
get<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> center<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:04.470> pretty

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
get to the center it's pretty

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.700 
get to the center it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:05.010> attack<00:01:05.689> they<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:07.260> fine

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
straightforward attack they are fine

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.429 
straightforward attack they are fine
because<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:08.760> no<00:01:08.909> Archer<00:01:09.240> Queen<00:01:09.450> left<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
because there's no Archer Queen left so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.490 
because there's no Archer Queen left so
it's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.369> easy<00:01:11.490> attack<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> send<00:01:13.350> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it's a really easy attack so I send in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
it's a really easy attack so I send in
balloons<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> north<00:01:14.460> west<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
balloons from the north west and the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.760 
balloons from the north west and the
south<00:01:16.290> east<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:18.080> again<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> because

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
south east and again I did this because

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.410 
south east and again I did this because
I<00:01:20.040> wanted<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> send<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:20.820> August<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I wanted to send my August from the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320 
I wanted to send my August from the
southwest<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> send<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:23.460> seven<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
southwest so I send about seven in the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390 
southwest so I send about seven in the
northwest<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> about<00:01:25.439> eight<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
northwest and about eight on the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.530 
northwest and about eight on the
southeast<00:01:28.850> basically<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:30.030> reasoning<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
southeast basically my reasoning for

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.170 
southeast basically my reasoning for
that<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.280> felt<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.579> easier<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> pull

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that was I felt it was easier to pull

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.870 
that was I felt it was easier to pull
the<00:01:33.270> CC<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> south<00:01:34.259> east<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.729> they

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the CC from the south east because they

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
the CC from the south east because they
were<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> travel<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> archer

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
were going to travel over the archer

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
were going to travel over the archer
tower<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.130> wanted<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.640> sure<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> they

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
tower so I wanted to make sure that they

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.679 
tower so I wanted to make sure that they
got<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.409> dropped<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.460> hog<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
got that I also dropped one hog just to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
got that I also dropped one hog just to
make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> CC<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
make sure that I got all of the CC and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.050 
make sure that I got all of the CC and
in<00:01:45.030> fact<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.390> did<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.439> fine<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.880> hog

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
in fact I did so it was fine but one hog

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.469 
in fact I did so it was fine but one hog
is<00:01:48.240> fine<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.860> pull<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> CC<00:01:50.790> over<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
is fine so I pull the CC over here to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.950 
is fine so I pull the CC over here to
this<00:01:51.600> barbarian<00:01:53.299> now<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.509> I've<00:01:54.630> cleared<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this barbarian now that I've cleared it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
this barbarian now that I've cleared it
out<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.439> got<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> cannon<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
out and I got that cannon up there so

hogs

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.360 
hogs
to<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.460> southwest<00:02:14.180> part<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.920> there<00:02:15.920> are<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
to the southwest part and there are a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.970 
to the southwest part and there are a
good<00:02:16.700> bit<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:16.850> defenses<00:02:17.450> up<00:02:17.660> still<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:18.590> it's

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
good bit of defenses up still but it's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.910 
good bit of defenses up still but it's
fine<00:02:19.430> because<00:02:20.260> they're<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.530> range<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
fine because they're not in range of the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.250 
fine because they're not in range of the
archer<00:02:22.490> queen<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.330> throw<00:02:23.510> down<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> hill<00:02:24.020> it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
archer queen so I throw down the hill it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.170 
archer queen so I throw down the hill it
saves<00:02:24.500> them<00:02:24.620> from<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.950> barb<00:02:25.190> King<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.700> in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
saves them from the barb King and in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.640 
saves them from the barb King and in
fact<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.630> were<00:02:26.750> no<00:02:26.870> double<00:02:27.260> bombs<00:02:27.800> there<00:02:29.650> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
fact there were no double bombs there so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010 
fact there were no double bombs there so
they<00:02:30.890> clean<00:02:31.160> up<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.520> area<00:02:31.730> while<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.630> have

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
they clean up that area while I have

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.480 
they clean up that area while I have
some<00:02:33.200> Wizards<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.680> here<00:02:33.950> cleaning<00:02:34.340> out

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
some Wizards over here cleaning out

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.580 
some Wizards over here cleaning out
around<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.150> outside<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.080> there<00:02:36.410> are<00:02:36.530> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
around the outside because there are a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.740 
around the outside because there are a
lot<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.800> buildings<00:02:37.190> out<00:02:37.370> there<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.270> Hogs<00:02:38.480> make

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
lot of buildings out there the Hogs make

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.930 
lot of buildings out there the Hogs make
it<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.080> center<00:02:39.410> throw<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:40.730> he'll

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
it to the center throw it on one he'll

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.940 
it to the center throw it on one he'll
obviously<00:02:41.210> then<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.080> wait<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> second<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.800> throw

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
obviously then I wait a second I throw

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.550 
obviously then I wait a second I throw
down<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> second<00:02:43.550> Hill<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.810> guarantees

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
down the second Hill this guarantees

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.980 
down the second Hill this guarantees
that<00:02:45.890> they<00:02:46.250> stay<00:02:46.460> alive<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> archer

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
that they stay alive see the archer

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.170 
that they stay alive see the archer
queen<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.380> taken<00:02:48.800> down<00:02:48.920> my<00:02:49.160> my<00:02:49.610> archer<00:02:49.970> queen

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
queen is taken down my my archer queen

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.230 
queen is taken down my my archer queen
so<00:02:51.140> they<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.440> no<00:02:51.470> threat<00:02:52.100> at<00:02:52.250> all<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.940> barb

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
so they have no threat at all this barb

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.910 
so they have no threat at all this barb
king<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.600> not<00:02:53.780> doing<00:02:54.050> anything<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.590> them<00:02:54.620> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
king is not doing anything to them and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.040 
king is not doing anything to them and
I'm<00:02:55.400> playing<00:02:55.730> off<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.030> fact<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.570> he<00:02:56.690> has

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
I'm playing off the fact that he has

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.620 
I'm playing off the fact that he has
kind<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.650> low-level<00:02:58.130> heroes<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.360> what's<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
kind of low-level heroes so what's the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.510 
kind of low-level heroes so what's the
clear<00:02:59.810> at<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.050> core<00:03:00.800> they<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.280> one

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
clear at the core they have that one

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.860 
clear at the core they have that one
little<00:03:01.760> section<00:03:02.030> left<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.600> have<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
little section left and I have it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.170 
little section left and I have it
another<00:03:03.290> Hill<00:03:03.470> left<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.460> they<00:03:04.580> take<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.820> out

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
another Hill left so they take that out

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.630 
another Hill left so they take that out
and<00:03:05.360> from<00:03:06.200> there<00:03:06.410> they<00:03:06.620> clean<00:03:07.190> up<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.460> base

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and from there they clean up the base

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.750 
and from there they clean up the base
and<00:03:08.170> since<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.410> place<00:03:09.740> my<00:03:09.920> Wizards<00:03:10.310> well<00:03:10.550> they

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
and since I place my Wizards well they

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.950 
and since I place my Wizards well they
went<00:03:10.940> all<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> way<00:03:11.180> around<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.570> base<00:03:11.720> and

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
went all the way around the base and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960 
went all the way around the base and
cleared<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.410> out<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:13.730> was<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> very

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
cleared it all out and it was a very

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.840
