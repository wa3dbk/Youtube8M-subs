white felt there's no actual thread

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.540 
white felt there's no actual thread
going<00:01:24.690> into<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:26.220> gonna<00:01:26.400> be

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
going into there and that's gonna be

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.910 
going into there and that's gonna be
your<00:01:26.700> base<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.930> lips<00:01:28.140> also<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.650> felt

your base and the lips also have felt

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.430 
your base and the lips also have felt
underneath<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.080> yarn<00:01:31.200> has

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
underneath it so that the yarn has

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.380 
underneath it so that the yarn has
something<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> catch<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
something to catch on because if you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
something to catch on because if you
don't<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.960> base<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.640> yarn

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
don't have a base like this the yarn

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.490 
don't have a base like this the yarn
tends<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.510> want<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.780> fall<00:01:36.990> through<00:01:37.020> these

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
tends to want to fall through these

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
tends to want to fall through these
stitches<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.550> then<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.910> get<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
stitches and then you don't get the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.320 
stitches and then you don't get the
shape<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
shape that you really want this is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.000 
shape that you really want this is
probably<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.840> first<00:01:43.470> attempts<00:01:43.979> at

strength and I'll also give a little bit

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.100 
strength and I'll also give a little bit
of<00:04:42.170> shine<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.450> because<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.570> know<00:04:44.720> realize

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
have water in it so they definitely give

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:57.379 
have water in it so they definitely give
off<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:48.950> good<00:04:49.160> shine

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.300 

and<00:04:57.990> depending<00:04:58.469> on<00:04:58.590> your<00:04:58.800> performance<00:04:59.219> you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
and depending on your performance you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.179 
and depending on your performance you
may<00:04:59.430> want<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.729> do<00:04:59.819> a<00:04:59.849> different<00:05:00.180> another<00:05:00.449> coat

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
may want to do a different another coat

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.409 
may want to do a different another coat
this<00:05:02.189> will<00:05:02.370> just<00:05:02.520> give<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:02.849> a<00:05:02.939> little<00:05:03.090> bit<00:05:03.270> more

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
this will just give it a little bit more

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.600 
this will just give it a little bit more
strength<00:05:03.990> but<00:05:04.349> also<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.949> strength<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.400> use<00:05:05.580> a

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
strength but also a strength you use a

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.890 
strength but also a strength you use a
live<00:05:05.819> you<00:05:06.060> lose<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> little<00:05:06.659> bit<00:05:06.810> of

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
live you lose a little bit of

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.300 
live you lose a little bit of
flexibility<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.770> when<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.860> put<00:05:10.979> it<00:05:11.069> on<00:05:11.129> your

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
flexibility and when you put it on your

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.730 
flexibility and when you put it on your
doll<00:05:11.490> eyes<00:05:11.699> your<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.569> skull<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.080> doll<00:05:13.259> of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
doll eyes your the skull of the doll of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.110 
doll eyes your the skull of the doll of
course<00:05:13.979> has<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.129> little<00:05:14.280> bit<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.550> curve<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:14.849> it

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
course has a little bit of a curve to it

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.480 
course has a little bit of a curve to it
so<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.419> can<00:05:15.569> I<00:05:15.840> typically<00:05:16.379> bend<00:05:17.219> it<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.460> little

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
so you can I typically bend it a little

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.189 
so you can I typically bend it a little
bit<00:05:17.789> onto<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.210> doll<00:05:18.330> anyways<00:05:18.750> I'm<00:05:18.900> not<00:05:19.050> sure

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
bit onto the doll anyways I'm not sure

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.040 
bit onto the doll anyways I'm not sure
if<00:05:19.319> you<00:05:19.409> can<00:05:19.530> see<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.949> reflection<00:05:20.069> on<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.789> I

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
if you can see the reflection on it I

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.499 
if you can see the reflection on it I
think<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.169> can<00:05:22.819> but<00:05:23.819> anyway<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.210> by<00:05:24.330> putting

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
think you can but anyway so by putting

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.939 
think you can but anyway so by putting
that<00:05:24.659> varnish<00:05:25.020> over<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.319> just<00:05:25.500> gives<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.800> some

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
that varnish over it just gives it some

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.290 
that varnish over it just gives it some
reflections<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.610> makes<00:05:26.759> it<00:05:26.849> look<00:05:26.939> a<00:05:26.969> little

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
reflections so it makes it look a little

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.499 
reflections so it makes it look a little
bit<00:05:27.509> more<00:05:27.659> real<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.639> then<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:29.909> take<00:05:30.150> your

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
bit more real and then you take your

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.019 
bit more real and then you take your
fabric<00:05:30.689> scissors<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.520> cut<00:05:35.550> along<00:05:35.819> the

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
fabric scissors and you cut along the

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.730 
fabric scissors and you cut along the
eye<00:05:37.099> and<00:05:38.099> typically<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.580> would<00:05:38.789> usually<00:05:39.740> let

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
eye and typically I would usually let

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.409 
eye and typically I would usually let
this<00:05:40.889> dry<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.400> then<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:41.639> would<00:05:41.789> go<00:05:41.909> back<00:05:42.090> with

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
this dry and then I would go back with

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.379 
this dry and then I would go back with
the<00:05:43.349> glue<00:05:43.560> later<00:05:43.800> lift<00:05:44.430> up<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.699> edges<00:05:44.879> and

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
the glue later lift up the edges and

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.249 
the glue later lift up the edges and
kind<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:45.659> glue<00:05:45.840> along<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> edges<00:05:47.990> because<00:05:48.990> I

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
kind of glue along the edges because I

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.129 
kind of glue along the edges because I
normally<00:05:49.409> don't<00:05:49.830> get<00:05:50.090> all<00:05:51.090> of<00:05:51.479> it<00:05:51.599> just<00:05:51.629> in<00:05:51.960> one

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
normally don't get all of it just in one

00:05:52.139 --> 00:06:08.770 
normally don't get all of it just in one
shot

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.960 

definitely<00:06:09.530> highly<00:06:09.830> recommend<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.670> let<00:06:10.820> your

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
definitely highly recommend to let your

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.450 
definitely highly recommend to let your
glue<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.300> your<00:06:12.230> nail-polish<00:06:12.590> dry<00:06:12.770> before

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
glue and your nail-polish dry before

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.710 
glue and your nail-polish dry before
doing<00:06:13.610> this<00:06:13.850> or<00:06:14.240> else<00:06:14.330> you're<00:06:14.450> gonna<00:06:14.570> have

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
doing this or else you're gonna have

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.240 
doing this or else you're gonna have
some<00:06:14.870> very<00:06:14.900> messy<00:06:15.410> fingers<00:06:15.680> like<00:06:15.860> I<00:06:15.950> do<00:06:16.010> right

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
some very messy fingers like I do right

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.800 
some very messy fingers like I do right
now<00:06:16.280> okay<00:06:17.590> anyway<00:06:18.590> so<00:06:19.450> you<00:06:20.450> should<00:06:20.660> pretty

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
now okay anyway so you should pretty

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.250 
now okay anyway so you should pretty
little<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.970> of<00:06:22.970> course<00:06:23.120> you<00:06:23.300> usually<00:06:23.840> do<00:06:24.080> both

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
little I of course you usually do both

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.150 
little I of course you usually do both
eyes<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:25.220> then<00:06:25.880> you<00:06:25.910> just<00:06:26.860> take<00:06:27.860> your<00:06:27.980> doll

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
eyes and then you just take your doll

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.830 
eyes and then you just take your doll
and<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:29.570> would<00:06:29.690> glue<00:06:29.930> it<00:06:30.050> on<00:06:30.230> there<00:06:30.500> I

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
and you would glue it on there I

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.840 
and you would glue it on there I
typically<00:06:32.840> start<00:06:33.260> gluing<00:06:33.950> in<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.610> middle

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
typically start gluing in the middle

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.340 
typically start gluing in the middle
just<00:06:35.120> put<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.360> little<00:06:35.540> bit<00:06:35.660> in<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:35.930> middle<00:06:36.140> I

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
just put a little bit in the middle I

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.650 
just put a little bit in the middle I
put<00:06:37.010> the<00:06:37.250> eye<00:06:37.280> where<00:06:37.580> I<00:06:37.610> want<00:06:37.880> it<00:06:37.940> press<00:06:38.360> it<00:06:38.540> on

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
put the eye where I want it press it on

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.960 
put the eye where I want it press it on
there<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:39.050> let<00:06:39.230> it<00:06:39.260> dry

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
there and let it dry

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.280 
there and let it dry
once<00:06:40.970> that<00:06:41.180> glue<00:06:41.330> is<00:06:41.360> dry<00:06:41.750> then<00:06:41.990> I'll<00:06:42.080> do<00:06:42.260> one

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
once that glue is dry then I'll do one

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.980 
once that glue is dry then I'll do one
corner<00:06:43.010> over<00:06:43.190> here<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.850> I'll<00:06:44.300> press<00:06:44.630> it<00:06:44.660> down

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
corner over here and I'll press it down

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.360 
corner over here and I'll press it down
against<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.800> skull

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
against the skull

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.220 
against the skull
let<00:06:46.850> that<00:06:47.000> dry<00:06:47.060> then<00:06:47.570> I'll<00:06:47.660> come<00:06:47.840> back<00:06:48.020> over

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
let that dry then I'll come back over

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.690 
let that dry then I'll come back over
here<00:06:48.350> because<00:06:48.710> usually<00:06:48.860> this<00:06:49.190> will<00:06:49.340> lift<00:06:49.520> up

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
here because usually this will lift up

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.220 
here because usually this will lift up
like<00:06:49.880> it's<00:06:50.030> doing<00:06:50.270> now<00:06:50.570> when<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.810> put<00:06:51.020> pressure

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
like it's doing now when I put pressure

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.080 
like it's doing now when I put pressure
on<00:06:51.410> it<00:06:51.440> put<00:06:52.160> glue<00:06:52.310> over<00:06:52.400> there<00:06:52.640> and<00:06:52.880> then<00:06:53.000> I'll

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
on it put glue over there and then I'll

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.230 
on it put glue over there and then I'll
hold<00:06:53.330> both<00:06:53.690> sides<00:06:53.750> down<00:06:54.470> because<00:06:55.250> you

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
hold both sides down because you

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.880 
hold both sides down because you
typically<00:06:56.570> want<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:56.960> try<00:06:57.140> to<00:06:57.200> get<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:57.560> fabric

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
typically want to try to get the fabric

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.410 
typically want to try to get the fabric
to<00:06:58.040> curved<00:06:58.370> you<00:06:58.700> kind<00:06:58.940> of<00:06:58.970> see<00:06:59.150> how<00:06:59.240> it's

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
to curved you kind of see how it's

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.040 
to curved you kind of see how it's
curving<00:07:01.210> okay<00:07:02.210> so<00:07:02.270> that's<00:07:02.600> what<00:07:02.750> you<00:07:02.810> want<00:07:02.990> it

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
curving okay so that's what you want it

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.180 
curving okay so that's what you want it
to<00:07:03.140> do<00:07:03.260> you<00:07:03.380> want<00:07:03.530> it<00:07:03.590> to<00:07:03.650> be<00:07:03.740> able<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.919> sit<00:07:04.160> on

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
to do you want it to be able to sit on

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.940 
to do you want it to be able to sit on
the<00:07:04.400> aisle<00:07:04.550> it'll<00:07:04.820> bit<00:07:04.910> more<00:07:05.060> naturally<00:07:05.570> I

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
the aisle it'll bit more naturally I

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.140 
the aisle it'll bit more naturally I
typically<00:07:06.950> recommend<00:07:07.430> that<00:07:07.580> you<00:07:07.790> do<00:07:08.030> your

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
typically recommend that you do your

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.030 
typically recommend that you do your
hair<00:07:08.450> first<00:07:08.780> on<00:07:09.140> your<00:07:09.169> doll<00:07:09.440> because<00:07:09.860> this

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
hair first on your doll because this

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.620 
hair first on your doll because this
will<00:07:10.190> give<00:07:10.340> a<00:07:10.580> little<00:07:11.240> bit<00:07:11.330> more<00:07:11.450> definition

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
will give a little bit more definition

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.560 
will give a little bit more definition
to<00:07:12.169> the<00:07:12.290> face<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:13.120> let<00:07:14.120> you<00:07:14.210> know<00:07:14.330> kind<00:07:14.510> of

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
to the face and let you know kind of

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.020 
to the face and let you know kind of
where<00:07:14.720> to<00:07:14.840> place<00:07:15.050> your<00:07:15.230> eyes<00:07:15.410> I<00:07:15.440> think<00:07:16.030> putting

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
where to place your eyes I think putting

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.100 
where to place your eyes I think putting
the<00:07:17.120> hair<00:07:17.330> on<00:07:17.450> will<00:07:17.630> give<00:07:17.750> you<00:07:17.810> a<00:07:17.870> little<00:07:17.990> bit

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
the hair on will give you a little bit

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.630 
the hair on will give you a little bit
better<00:07:18.230> eye<00:07:18.380> placement<00:07:19.010> also<00:07:19.250> if<00:07:19.340> you<00:07:19.400> do<00:07:19.490> any

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
better eye placement also if you do any

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.010 
better eye placement also if you do any
kind<00:07:19.850> of<00:07:19.910> needle<00:07:20.180> sculpting<00:07:20.630> like<00:07:20.780> I<00:07:20.840> already

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
kind of needle sculpting like I already

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.260 
kind of needle sculpting like I already
did<00:07:21.140> the<00:07:21.230> nose<00:07:21.410> here<00:07:21.830> but<00:07:22.520> I<00:07:22.550> would<00:07:22.940> typically

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
did the nose here but I would typically

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.010 
did the nose here but I would typically
do<00:07:23.930> the<00:07:24.140> eye<00:07:24.169> sockets<00:07:24.800> too<00:07:25.160> so<00:07:25.729> any<00:07:26.660> needle

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
do the eye sockets too so any needle

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.690 
do the eye sockets too so any needle
sculpting<00:07:27.500> I<00:07:27.650> would<00:07:27.830> recommend<00:07:28.340> doing<00:07:28.460> it

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
sculpting I would recommend doing it

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.240 
sculpting I would recommend doing it
before<00:07:29.090> you<00:07:29.300> put<00:07:29.479> your<00:07:29.600> eyes<00:07:29.780> on<00:07:29.810> it<00:07:30.380> just

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
before you put your eyes on it just

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.590 
before you put your eyes on it just
makes<00:07:31.400> it<00:07:31.490> a<00:07:31.580> little<00:07:31.640> bit<00:07:31.790> easier<00:07:32.210> to<00:07:32.270> tell

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 
makes it a little bit easier to tell

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.500 
makes it a little bit easier to tell
where<00:07:32.840> your<00:07:33.290> eyes<00:07:33.440> are<00:07:33.470> going<00:07:33.740> to<00:07:33.800> sit<00:07:34.160> and

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
where your eyes are going to sit and

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.469 
where your eyes are going to sit and
everything<00:07:35.510> so<00:07:36.550> anyways<00:07:37.550> that's<00:07:37.760> pretty<00:07:38.360> much

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 
everything so anyways that's pretty much

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.780 
everything so anyways that's pretty much
it<00:07:38.750> on<00:07:38.990> this<00:07:39.290> method<00:07:39.710> it's<00:07:39.919> the<00:07:40.370> easiest

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:40.790 
it on this method it's the easiest

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.330 
it on this method it's the easiest
method<00:07:41.300> to<00:07:41.419> do<00:07:41.600> and<00:07:41.930> if<00:07:42.919> you<00:07:43.010> have<00:07:43.160> an<00:07:43.250> eye

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 
method to do and if you have an eye

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.180 
method to do and if you have an eye
template<00:07:43.790> and<00:07:43.910> it<00:07:43.970> works<00:07:44.570> out<00:07:44.720> pretty<00:07:44.780> good<00:07:44.990> so

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.190 
template and it works out pretty good so

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.130 
template and it works out pretty good so
anyways<00:07:46.190> that's<00:07:46.460> what<00:07:46.610> it<00:07:46.700> would<00:07:46.760> look<00:07:46.880> like

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.140 
anyways that's what it would look like

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.530 
anyways that's what it would look like
maybe<00:07:48.140> your<00:07:48.350> done
