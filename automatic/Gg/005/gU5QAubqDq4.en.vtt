00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.079
 This time we still have many questions 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.140
 inform why I want it 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.059
 That's why I'm going to train you now 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 introduce different devices and these 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.070
 usually clarify what kind of characteristics I 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
 have built with him from sharing because the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 Many of these devices I will give you now 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 its started when it's fast 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:54.989
 has to move and the white mountains 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.329
 both can all beat hopefully 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.300
 are neither ndr radio they are not 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.980
 insanely great but it's ours that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 because you always get it 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.430
 easy 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.679
 an extremely nice device what me 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.649
 really extreme moves us very hard 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.570
 Eat something but we get 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.869
 a super of the trends you can fill 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.210
 pig the device is making a noise 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.049
 but it is simply filled by the moment 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.630
 a great thing 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 there we can learn about rollovers 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.240
 exactly to place and manufactures 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.340
 I have only one people why 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.430
 Hack as it does in the attacks of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.459
 childhood very later and that has him 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 especially loans now pledged or 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.060
 circling above us on the wine always off 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.870
 reinbek always skip and what I completely 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 wrong 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.989
 components are filled with air and then have 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.780
 we the mistakes are called the answer very much 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.909
 fast movement my moderately low 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 weight have that one for 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.670
 speed on sure 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.930
 You can make small money everywhere and 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.319
 quite animal training speed 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.580
 occurs safety 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.580
 that's awesome 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.890
 which devices I use for what I hope 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 for you so that you a bit 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.980
 why did you train ? 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.660
 possibly make a second consultation 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.680
 part of this year, you still need your time 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.950
 some things 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.950
 it was nice part until then
