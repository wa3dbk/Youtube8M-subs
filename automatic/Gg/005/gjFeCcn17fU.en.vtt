though once it's in Big Ten every every

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:57.420 
though once it's in Big Ten every every
game<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.190> basically<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.700> rival<00:02:43.000> game

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
it's going to feel like the zone is

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.390 
it's going to feel like the zone is
still<00:03:53.230> packed<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.860> because<00:03:54.100> we're<00:03:54.250> so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
still packed in just because we're so

hoping<00:04:00.760> for<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.240> know<00:04:01.650> less<00:04:02.650> penetration

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
hoping for you know less penetration

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.980 
hoping for you know less penetration
more<00:04:03.460> challenge<00:04:03.820> shots<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.300> then<00:04:04.450> get<00:04:04.960> out

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
more challenge shots and then get out

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:19.320 
more challenge shots and then get out
and<00:04:05.200> run<00:04:16.200> just<00:04:17.200> don't<00:04:17.760> don't<00:04:18.760> lose<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.000> edge

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
and run just don't don't lose that edge

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.789 
and run just don't don't lose that edge
that<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.810> started<00:04:20.109> with<00:04:20.170> in<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> be<00:04:20.620> any

longer<00:04:22.270> than<00:04:22.450> high<00:04:22.600> school<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.070> just<00:04:24.220> got

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
longer than high school but you just got

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.430 
longer than high school but you just got
to<00:04:24.400> keep<00:04:24.580> fighting<00:04:24.850> through<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:26.290> whole

to keep fighting through it it's whole
nother<00:04:26.590> level<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.430> mean<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.850> think<00:04:27.880> I'll

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
nother level but I mean I think I'll

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.660 
nother level but I mean I think I'll
have<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> freshman<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:29.220> really<00:04:30.220> dealt<00:04:30.460> with<00:04:30.550> it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
have a freshman of really dealt with it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.850 
have a freshman of really dealt with it
pretty<00:04:30.850> well<00:04:31.060> no<00:04:31.840> walls<00:04:32.050> or<00:04:32.260> anything<00:04:32.320> being

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
pretty well no walls or anything being

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:41.490 
pretty well no walls or anything being
at<00:04:33.100> or<00:04:33.250> anything<00:04:38.640> are<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.790> keys<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.500> not

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
at or anything are the keys to that not

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.020

turning<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.800> ball<00:04:41.860> over<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.310> play<00:04:42.460> better

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
turning the ball over and play better

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.960 
turning the ball over and play better
defense<00:04:43.480> I<00:04:44.160> feel<00:04:45.160> like<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.370> got<00:04:45.640> rushed

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
defense I feel like we just got rushed

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.000 
defense I feel like we just got rushed
in<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.360> beginning<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.840> lot<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.919> guys

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
in the beginning a lot of the guys

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.130 
in the beginning a lot of the guys
weren't<00:04:48.220> playing<00:04:48.460> their<00:04:48.730> game<00:04:48.970> we<00:04:49.870> let<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
weren't playing their game we let the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.510 
weren't playing their game we let the
defense<00:04:50.290> kind<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.710> dictate<00:04:51.040> what<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.310> going

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
defense kind of dictate what was going

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.320 
defense kind of dictate what was going
on<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:53.080> know<00:04:53.200> after<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.800> timeout<00:04:54.330> TV

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
and uh you know it got to a point where

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.950 
and uh you know it got to a point where
we<00:05:05.860> kept<00:05:06.070> climbing<00:05:06.220> back<00:05:06.520> in<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.090> I<00:05:07.390> think<00:05:07.870> in

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
we kept climbing back in and I think in

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.760 
we kept climbing back in and I think in
the<00:05:08.020> beginning<00:05:08.140> we<00:05:08.410> were<00:05:08.470> trying<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.710> make

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the beginning we were trying to make

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.380 
the beginning we were trying to make
that<00:05:08.980> home<00:05:09.160> run<00:05:09.370> play<00:05:09.640> when<00:05:09.850> we<00:05:09.970> just<00:05:10.180> needed

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
that home run play when we just needed

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.650 
that home run play when we just needed
to<00:05:10.450> make<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.690> single

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.800 

range<00:05:21.550> well<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.669> been<00:05:22.790> an<00:05:22.940> emphasis<00:05:23.450> little

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
range well it's been an emphasis little

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.200 
range well it's been an emphasis little
year<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:23.990> mean<00:05:24.200> we<00:05:24.470> can't<00:05:24.710> take<00:05:25.460> corner<00:05:25.880> threes

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
year I mean we can't take corner threes

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.600 
year I mean we can't take corner threes
and<00:05:26.620> can't<00:05:27.620> turn<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.889> ball<00:05:28.010> over<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.460> that's

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
and can't turn the ball over and that's

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.220 
and can't turn the ball over and that's
just<00:05:28.790> easy<00:05:29.000> buckets<00:05:29.389> for<00:05:29.510> them<00:05:29.630> in<00:05:29.720> transition

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
just easy buckets for them in transition

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.890 
just easy buckets for them in transition
so<00:05:30.580> we<00:05:31.580> approaches<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.090> same<00:05:32.270> way<00:05:32.419> we<00:05:32.630> always

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
so we approaches the same way we always

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.180 
so we approaches the same way we always
have<00:05:33.080> just<00:05:33.290> getting<00:05:33.470> after<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.010> really

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
have just getting after it and really

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.120 
have just getting after it and really
working<00:05:35.090> on<00:05:35.180> getting<00:05:35.360> back<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.919> taking<00:05:36.919> away

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
working on getting back and taking away

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.800 
working on getting back and taking away
the<00:05:37.250> three<00:05:37.430> pointers<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:38.090> open<00:05:38.540> layups

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
the three pointers the open layups

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.090 
the three pointers the open layups
driving<00:05:39.290> lanes<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.650> all<00:05:39.740> that<00:05:39.830> kind<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.040> stuff

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
driving lanes and all that kind of stuff

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.129 
driving lanes and all that kind of stuff
