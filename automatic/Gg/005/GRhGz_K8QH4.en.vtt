00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
wine tasting is active now that doesn't

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.870 
wine tasting is active now that doesn't
mean<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> needs<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.899> be<00:00:27.989> stiff<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.769> formal<00:00:29.339> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
mean it needs to be stiff or formal the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.429 
mean it needs to be stiff or formal the
only<00:00:30.149> reason<00:00:30.300> we're<00:00:30.539> actively<00:00:30.869> tasting<00:00:31.289> wine

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.840 
only reason we're actively tasting wine
is<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:31.769> we're<00:00:31.949> building<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> sensory

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is because we're building a sensory

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450 
is because we're building a sensory
memory<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> word<00:00:34.350> sounds<00:00:34.710> fancy<00:00:35.280> but
