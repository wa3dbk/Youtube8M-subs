00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi guys, okay, I'm back to the second. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.379
 video of my house shift I did the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.639
 first and then the people wanted to know 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.030
 the rest of the house 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.429
 so here I have the room of the 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.350
 Breakfast in the lunch room we put 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.160
 this hydraulic tile here doing 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.539
 laugh table frame our same table 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.849
 of demolition a very large table because 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.279
 the family is big right then we have 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.750
 a table of eight seats with 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 large armchairs is at the ends 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.910
 so here is the lunch room 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.309
 formerly in this house that was kitchen and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 there was nothing at all then in reforming people 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 made this space here 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 we did it as a kitchen we did 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.800
 the breakfast room and then the kitchen 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.800
 here is integrated the farmhouse kitchen 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.930
 kitchen has a very high right foot that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 we put a lining of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 wood 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.850
 so the foot is the right foot of this kitchen 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 It was very high up here and it's airy here in the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 we have an island on the island we 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.770
 we also put a hydraulic tile 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 that we chose the color the model and the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 people put here is on this island 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.780
 here it would be to put the machine 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.000
 to wash we put a cellar 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.869
 so we think we use more like 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 cellar of what it is like with the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.130
 to wash 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 so here we have on our island here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.040
 we have a wall that I go 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.979
 placing random dishes that I 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.619
 I earn dishes that I buy then we 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.409
 Putting on there is a watch without 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:02:00.380
 old there at the door of the laundry 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:03.360
 O here is what I have mine 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 favorite verses that I leave until 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.300
 Maria, why are you here for some time? 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.190
 I like and stay here, look who I am. 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.280
 asked how it is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.210
 closet does not have much secret is all of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.510
 white crockery I think white crockery 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:27.840
 beautiful and easy to have practice 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.380
 so here I have the ac collection sink 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.200
 that we have a collection of mugs, right? 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.630
 my son makes right mugs 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 people brought the places we went 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.730
 the people back there have more mugs and I 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.360
 had people had more but my daughters 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.150
 to marry and they were leading ne the mugs 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.260
 that were hers 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:03:00.630
 here we have a closet has 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.740
 television here has the barbecue that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.660
 It's in the kitchen and we use it a lot. 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.870
 and it is very functional 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.090
 then our kitchen is like seeing O 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 has a bench on the side where you have 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:22.590
 chairs there too and it works like this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.709
 It's very bright and airy there. 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.140
 a tree is a physical that is here in the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.370
 kitchen and it is growing I want 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.230
 but it grows a lot to stay in 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 The kitchen is because it gives a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.090
 feeling as well as welcoming 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.690
 Time we have another shelf here. 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.650
 also up here that we put 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:52.590
 some things i have a bathroom 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.769
 look here we have a bathroom of 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.780
 pool this bathroom was also sent 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.800
 make the hydraulic tiles for 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:07.280
 make these two toilets well 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:12.450
 tiny but it is very functional 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.580
 here leaving we have a terror the side and 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.239
 if you got sideways the idea is to cover up later 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.830
 invites us not yet covered the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.419
 we preserved was because this 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.510
 we had not made a 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.020
 pergolated agent preserved that era 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.229
 we made a corner 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.310
 hero is to preserve was here has a 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.590
 division with a demolition brick is 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.319
 this old machinery foot of my 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.259
 Mother made a dresser to put 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:45.150
 above and here it is a support that 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:49.379
 we need is here there is the O 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.419
 porch here she is so we put 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.849
 a wooden porcelain tile that mimics 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.949
 wood running here or on the floor 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.770
 Here we have one wheel that 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.250
 used by electric companies 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.300
 We put a silicone 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:10.430
 It works like a little table for us, right? 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.470
 here are the plants here have those 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.150
 penduricals that we like that we 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.960
 exchange is thus not always O looks okay 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:28.229
 Seeing how cool it is when 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:31.620
 it's windy here we have a network 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.150
 there in that corner until the state xuxa 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.789
 people swimming pool stuff that was 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.590
 half empty on a crate shelf 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:43.110
 here also to store the things that 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:46.529

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.259
 here we have a spring that we 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.650
 we planted when the house was being 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.139
 reformed 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.590
 Look how beautiful she is already well. 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.050
 high 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:06.229
 Seeing florida well 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:09.569
 around the yard is surrounded todinho era 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.389
 here in the background we have a lion's mouth 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.460
 which is a fountain now has no water 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.759
 because dengue case we preferred 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.779
 always be careful not to take the risk, 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.789
 dengue mosquito 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.830
 but when scientific fills out of the mouth 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.190
 of the lion so water is such a grace 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.940
 well look here the vision of the house 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.360
 on it stands a quarter of the boys 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:37.910

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:40.750
 here is the pool and so on 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.380
 this corner is a corner yes 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.720

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.970
 cozy 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:59.480

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.870
 doors is has the side door 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.690

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.390

 And look, my question is, is this a lot? 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.930

 leave the house fresh 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.070
 so this is it, people do not have much 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.080

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.530
