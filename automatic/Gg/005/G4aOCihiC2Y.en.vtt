hey<00:00:21.750> guys<00:00:21.960> what's<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.500> Audrey<00:00:22.800> from

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
hey guys what's up it's Audrey from

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.650 
hey guys what's up it's Audrey from
bawlin<00:00:23.400> entertainment<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.090> today<00:00:24.539> we're

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
bawlin entertainment and today we're

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.060 
bawlin entertainment and today we're
going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.930> taking<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> look<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> last

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be taking a look at the last

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
going to be taking a look at the last
step<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.550> solving<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.000> Rubik's<00:00:27.330> Cube<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
step of solving a Rubik's Cube in the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
step of solving a Rubik's Cube in the
past<00:00:28.289> few<00:00:28.500> steps<00:00:28.829> over<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> past<00:00:29.759> six<00:00:30.119> steps

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
past few steps over the past six steps

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.170 
past few steps over the past six steps
we<00:00:30.930> got<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> yellow<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:31.770> our<00:00:32.070> corners<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.970> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we got the yellow top our corners on the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
we got the yellow top our corners on the
top<00:00:33.210> last<00:00:33.660> layer<00:00:33.930> our<00:00:34.230> first<00:00:35.040> two<00:00:35.250> layers

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
top last layer our first two layers

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.759 
top last layer our first two layers
completed<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:36.510> white<00:00:36.780> layer<00:00:37.050> completed

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
completed and our white layer completed

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.020 
completed and our white layer completed
so<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:39.089> we<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.129> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:41.790> if

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
so what we want to do is if you well if

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
so what we want to do is if you well if
you<00:00:42.239> haven't<00:00:42.750> gotten<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.379> steps<00:00:43.710> completed

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
description that way you can copy them

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
description that way you can copy them
down<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.119> use<00:01:15.300> them<00:01:15.570> whenever<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.470> them

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
down and use them whenever you need them

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
down and use them whenever you need them
so<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.149> is<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so now what we want to do is we want to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660 
so now what we want to do is we want to
get<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:18.899> edges<00:01:19.410> oriented<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.460> want

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
get these edges oriented just so we want

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
get these edges oriented just so we want
this<00:01:20.820> red<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> come<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> orange<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> go

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this red to come here this orange to go

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
this red to come here this orange to go
there<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> blue<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:24.060> come<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.659> which

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
there and this blue to come here which

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
there and this blue to come here which
is<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> case<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.520> already<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is good in this case we already have a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.410 
is good in this case we already have a
green<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.290> sometimes<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
green but sometimes you're not going to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890 
green but sometimes you're not going to
you're<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:32.150> they're<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.509> not

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you're going to be they're going to not

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.170 
you're going to be they're going to not
have<00:01:34.290> any<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.220> colors<00:01:35.549> matched<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:36.060> in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
have any of the colors matched up in

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
have any of the colors matched up in
that<00:01:36.390> case<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.960> doesn't<00:01:37.170> matter<00:01:37.320> how<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> cube

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that case it doesn't matter how the cube

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
that case it doesn't matter how the cube
faces<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.570> sure<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.960> yellow<00:01:40.290> on

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
faces just make sure you have yellow on

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
faces just make sure you have yellow on
top<00:01:40.619> white<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> bottom<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.579> always<00:01:41.939> we're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going to be left 180 top inverse and the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
going to be left 180 top inverse and the
back<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:56.420> clockwise<00:01:57.420> front

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
back is going to be clockwise front

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
back is going to be clockwise front
counterclockwise<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> inverse<00:02:00.420> we're

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
counterclockwise which is inverse we're

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
counterclockwise which is inverse we're
going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> take<00:02:01.619> our<00:02:01.770> left<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:02.880> once<00:02:03.149> again

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
going to take our left side once again

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
going to take our left side once again
do<00:02:03.869> 180<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.060> put<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.180> back<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.320> weight

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
do 180 and put our back back up weight

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.180 
do 180 and put our back back up weight
clockwise<00:02:08.880> or<00:02:09.780> counter<00:02:10.320> clockwise<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.860> mean<00:02:11.009> in

clockwise or counter clockwise I mean in
front<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:12.799> clockwise<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.670> we're

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
front with clockwise and then we're

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.140 
front with clockwise and then we're
going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.239> do<00:02:15.630> top<00:02:16.110> inverse<00:02:17.989> left<00:02:18.989> 180<00:02:20.150> now

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
going to do top inverse left 180 now

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.479 
going to do top inverse left 180 now
that's<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.859> fill<00:02:23.130> out<00:02:23.280> one

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
that's going to as you see fill out one

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.470 
that's going to as you see fill out one
of<00:02:23.519> our<00:02:23.730> sides<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.820> algorithm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
of our sides now the this algorithm

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.550 
of our sides now the this algorithm
actually<00:02:28.129> rotates<00:02:29.129> your<00:02:29.340> edge<00:02:29.489> pieces

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
actually rotates your edge pieces

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.870 
actually rotates your edge pieces
counterclockwise

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
counterclockwise

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.440 
counterclockwise
so<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.510> some<00:02:34.380> cases<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.340> which<00:02:36.060> I'll<00:02:36.210> show<00:02:36.420> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
so in some cases and which I'll show you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.800 
so in some cases and which I'll show you
in<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.050> bit<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.790> won't<00:02:38.790> always<00:02:39.210> get<00:02:39.630> you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
in a little bit it won't always get you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.750 
in a little bit it won't always get you
there<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.500> two<00:02:40.800> you're<00:02:41.250> gonna<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.610> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
there in one or two you're gonna have to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.450 
there in one or two you're gonna have to
do<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> up<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.870> maximum<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.470> three<00:02:43.890> times<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
do it up to a maximum of three times to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.180 
do it up to a maximum of three times to
get<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> hold<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
get it so the way I do it is I hold the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.150 
get it so the way I do it is I hold the
cube<00:02:47.520> with<00:02:47.880> sort<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.570> top<00:02:49.350> facing<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
cube with sort of the top facing up a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.660 
cube with sort of the top facing up a
little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:51.210> still<00:02:51.300> left<00:02:51.870> 180<00:02:52.740> but

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
little bit but it's still left 180 but

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.390 
little bit but it's still left 180 but
if<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> full<00:02:54.810> side<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.010> I'm

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
if you have a full side like this I'm

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.340 
if you have a full side like this I'm
sorry<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.790> forgot<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.210> mention<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.140> want

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
sorry I forgot to mention this you want

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
sorry I forgot to mention this you want
to<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> right<00:02:59.130> okay<00:02:59.700> if<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.450> have

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
to have it on the right okay if you have

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.970 
to have it on the right okay if you have
a<00:03:00.630> full<00:03:00.990> side<00:03:01.230> if<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:01.890> doesn't

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
a full side if you don't it doesn't

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.800 
a full side if you don't it doesn't
matter<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> right

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
matter but you have this on the right

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.500 
matter but you have this on the right
and<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.710> do<00:03:04.980> left<00:03:05.280> 180<00:03:06.530> top<00:03:07.970> inverse<00:03:08.970> but

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and so you do left 180 top inverse but

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.270 
and so you do left 180 top inverse but
look<00:03:09.690> at<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.320> take<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:11.220> two

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
look at this you can just take these two

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.700 
look at this you can just take these two
fingers<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.720> however<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.530> want

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
fingers right here or however you want

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.070 
fingers right here or however you want
to<00:03:13.800> do<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.550> just<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.000> white<00:03:15.750> and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
to do it and you just put that white and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.040 
to do it and you just put that white and
yellow<00:03:16.260> bar<00:03:16.680> down<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.790> side<00:03:18.060> which<00:03:19.020> is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
yellow bar down on this side which is

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.120 
yellow bar down on this side which is
going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.740> be<00:03:19.980> your<00:03:20.400> back<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.600> front<00:03:22.500> movement

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
going to be your back and front movement

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.360 
going to be your back and front movement
and<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.730> do<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.090> 180<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:26.250> you

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and then you do this 180 and then you

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
and then you do this 180 and then you
just<00:03:26.580> bring<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.970> back<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.420> which<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.050> lot

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
just bring it back up which was a lot

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.770 
just bring it back up which was a lot
easier<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:29.100> me<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> remember<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.480> if

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
easier for me to remember and then if

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.870 
easier for me to remember and then if
you<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.620> lost<00:03:31.950> at<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.370> point

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you get lost at this point

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.610 
you get lost at this point
you<00:03:33.090> can<00:03:33.240> always<00:03:33.360> look<00:03:33.660> at<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.810> white<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.110> see

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
you can always look at the white and see

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.200 
you can always look at the white and see
where<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.830> have<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.130> put<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.000> just

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
where you have to put it so you just

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.380 
where you have to put it so you just
match<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.630> blue<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.320> do<00:03:37.980> 180<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.310> that's

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
match up that blue and do 180 so that's

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.850 
match up that blue and do 180 so that's
how<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.450> finish<00:03:42.690> off<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.110> edge<00:03:43.230> pieces<00:03:43.560> like

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
how you finish off the edge pieces like

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.930 
how you finish off the edge pieces like
that<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.520> case<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.480> already<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:46.940> one

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that in this case you already have one

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.080 
that in this case you already have one
face<00:03:48.240> completed<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:50.550> we're<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.910> go

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
face completed and so we're going to go

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.240 
face completed and so we're going to go
over<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.420> one<00:03:51.660> last<00:03:51.870> time<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:53.070> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
over it one last time you just do it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.500

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
going to finish it out like I said you

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.610 
going to finish it out like I said you
may<00:04:17.520> have<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.299> three<00:04:18.810> times<00:04:19.170> if

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
may have to do it up to three times if

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500 
may have to do it up to three times if
you<00:04:20.010> don't<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.460> anything<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.940> start<00:04:21.330> with

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
you don't have anything to start with

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.330 
you don't have anything to start with
and<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:21.870> once<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.260> get<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> full<00:04:22.800> face<00:04:23.070> you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
and then once you get a full face you

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.390 
and then once you get a full face you
have<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.930> rotate<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.380> piece<00:04:25.650> like<00:04:26.010> let's<00:04:26.250> say

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
have to rotate this piece like let's say

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000 
have to rotate this piece like let's say
this<00:04:26.550> blue<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.120> right<00:04:27.390> back<00:04:27.630> here<00:04:28.050> since<00:04:28.830> it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
this blue is right back here since it

this blue is right back here since it

rotates counterclockwise it's going to
take<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.290> one<00:04:31.620> algorithm<00:04:31.980> two<00:04:32.670> algorithms<00:04:33.000> to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
take you one algorithm two algorithms to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.850 
take you one algorithm two algorithms to
get<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.630> back<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.960> its<00:04:34.110> place<00:04:34.260> once<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.830> a

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
get it back in its place once you have a

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.930 
get it back in its place once you have a
completed<00:04:35.310> side<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.300> complete<00:04:36.780> aside<00:04:37.140> one

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
completed side so you complete aside one

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.850 
completed side so you complete aside one
two<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> that's<00:04:39.510> three<00:04:40.110> algorithms<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.740> have

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
two and that's three algorithms you have

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.680 
two and that's three algorithms you have
to<00:04:40.979> do<00:04:41.160> but<00:04:41.400> it's<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.669> exact<00:04:41.940> same<00:04:41.970> algorithm

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
to do but it's the exact same algorithm

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.780 
to do but it's the exact same algorithm
