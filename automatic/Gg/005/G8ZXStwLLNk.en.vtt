00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
 hello very good today we are going to see one in 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.440
 boxing that is a bit special I have not 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.170
 asked me to come to the pc box of 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.710
 components so it's a bit 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.480
 surprise what's inside though 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.910
 you will already see it in the title and 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.349
 good as we are used to seeing 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.080
 instead of components they send us a 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.449
 kind of protection a little special and 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400
 here we have the protagonist did not know 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.519
 that was but good is a bring is the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.189
 mamba of the generation of 2012 with the 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.929
 4g sensor series and we have the part of 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.689
 Subsequent technical specifications 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.140
 of the mouse and here the mouse itself the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.940
 truth as packaging box 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 it deserves special mention because it does not look 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.540
 a mouse like this every day is very no 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.860
 it means roll of paper but good 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.379
 the presentation is quite careful 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.000
 At least here we have been confused 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.430
 we have damaged the package a little 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.800
 but good the rest of the wrapper is 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.420
 in perfect condition and after fighting with 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.199
 this protective plastic we can already 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.520
 remove it from the box that holds it is 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.289
 a normal cardboard box 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.050
 It has nothing inside and we've already passed 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.790
 let's say to the fat here first 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.130
 we remove a sheet of cardboard that we 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 he says welcome to the cult 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 thanks for the welcome we take out the 1st 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.890
 a little box that good comes with then 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 of the brand itself and tells us to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 gamers by gamers gives us a kind of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 link to your website and we open it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 inside we have all the paperwork the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 brochures that we always send fraser 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.750
 well the first green sheet is a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630
 welcome that gives us the brand the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 second is a quick start guide that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 good is going to tell us what each 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.300
 button every part of the mouse and so on 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 way a little 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.100
 quickie the following is a guide 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.620
 teacher that allows us to learn how 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.870
 finally configure the mythical sticker 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.810
 cani of the brand and we went to the drawers 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.360
 the first three will catch on 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.310
 the battery maybe the simplest of all 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.640
 you only have two pieces inside that are going to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.680
 be the battery itself and the cap of the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 battery that comes with a magnet the battery 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.790
 It can last about eight hours and it's 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.530
 quite heavy the truth and let's move on 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.010
 next box that is the one of the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.180
 base station or dock what good 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.069
 you can see in videos of it seems 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.409
 rather smaller than it is 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.889
 the size I do not know medium to say some 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.299
 way black glossy piano me 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.790
 I would have preferred it mate but good not 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.370
 class is pretty bad if I have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 you can call 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.860
 well to a dock of a mouse and good 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.720
 next box that is the cable 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.549
 usb a cable that comes with a 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.920
 protection of a fairly good mesh 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.069
 in my opinion the protected by a 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.349
 kind of 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.830
 tel has somehow produced one of 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.840
 the connectors is mini usb 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.210
 the cable as I'm telling you is pretty 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.990
 well lined and the other connection is a 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.020
 normal usb 2.0 we went to the complicated 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.420
 which it is open the box as mouse 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.930
 well we follow the steps and first we go 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.730
 to follow 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.799
 the first indication that is to pull the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.920
 plastic upwards and we'll leave the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.079
 mouse to the air like who says next 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.170
 slide it to the side and we can 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.780
 take out here what we have the base can you 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.060
 seem expensive or cheap or whatever we want 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.709
 but we can not deny that the mouse is 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.109
 Pretty pretty has enough style 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.939
 finally we remove the sheet of 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.420
 plastic and we can leave it totally 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.010
 free surprise that weighs little and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.109
 we have here the battery connection 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.810
 the double laser sensor the on button and 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.269
 off the connection to the dock and the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.790
 free the cable a pretty roulette 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.930
 silent where left and right 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.609
 Certainly roulette also 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.590
 you can press as is normal we have 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.970
 then several programmable buttons to the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.530
 sides in general the whole mouse is 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.890
 programmable could admit enough 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.840
 macros 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.080
 now I'm sorry and we're going to do is see 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.730
 how can you put the battery and the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.100
 tapita although it may seem easy by 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.220
 well, it always helps if someone 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.050
 you leave it done the first thing is to place 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.490
 the left part of the battery and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.620
 press the one on the right with that already 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.380
 would be fully prepared and the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.580
 next the sheet that protects it has 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.890
 a magnet that is the one that is going to commission 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.320
 of connecting it to the dock first part 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.730
 narrow and second the wide part and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.130
 you even have to give as well as a kind 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.280
 of relief and connect so easy the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.280
 dock 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.330
 the cable as I said before you can 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.009
 connect to both the base and the mouse and 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.569
 we would have a wire mouse though 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.909
 did not clash at all with the rest 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.229
 of the material and with the eyelash that 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.500
 have we can release it without any 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.330
 problem 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.700
 now let's move on to see how it 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.260
 download the necessary material so that 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.390
 operate the mouse and we have to go to the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.210
 page that tells us in the first 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.670
 box drivers support section 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.990
 software and manuals to the part of the 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.120
 right let's react the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.410
 razer mice producers and let's 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.110
 to select ours that is called 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.630
 mamba our version in the 2012 by 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.210
 we both access your subfolder and here 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.130
 we're going to have both the drivers and the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.570
 firmware updaters such as 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.640
 master guides inside the drivers 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.680
 let's have three versions of the mac 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.240
 which is the one I'm going to use now 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.890
 old windows and a modern one 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.780
 windows then depending on our 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.500
 operating system we will download the one that 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.440
 let's see convenient 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.300
 we go back and we also see the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.740
 updated firmware in my case the 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.000
 mouse and base were updated 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.700
 although it can be flashed without any 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.140
 problem the new version the only fault 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.120
 is that this can only be done under 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.340
 windows under mac can not be made of 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.430
 moment 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.020
 and finally if we go back and we 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.699
 we put in the last folder we will see 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.620
 some master guides that are identical 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.729
 those that already come to us in the brochure of 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.860
 first box that we have seen in the 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.949
 unboxing so if we want it in pdf 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.050
 we can download the software as such 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.699
 I thought it was much worse on mac 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.440
 that in windows which I think 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.020
 pretty weird but good is pretty 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.139
 intuitive we can change both the 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.520
 profiles like those of pepe and others and 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.849
 especially for a function that is 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.709
 pretty cool the one we're seeing 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.589
 the changing colors of both the base 

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:13.319
 as the mouse we can select from 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.689
 a base of a color palette that 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.629
 We can customize to our liking by 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.059
 complete or we could also select 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.909
 a kind of looping that's good 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:25.259
 going through different colors and going 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.649
 selecting the time in the color he 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.839
 you want on your own when we have the 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.860
 mouse on the doc base and move to a minute 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:35.789
 or the time that we have selected 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.319
 so that the light of the 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.869
 roulette and from the base itself will begin to 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.129
 blinking is a pretty cool effect 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:44.089
 but good at night can reach 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.089
 bother if we are asleep 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.110
 Also, while loading, let's see how 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.460
 the small LEDs that are illuminated 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.460
 they have in that crystal milestone the mouse 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.190
 as we see we are using a 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.470
 aluminum ironclad reaser rug 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.120
 and we can observe how the mouse just 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.760
 what we do moves a lot 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.260
 freely does not have any kind of 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.570
 friction with the mat and is 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.570
 pretty good like that 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.010
 as we see the time does not do too much 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.660
 noise although it seems that it can have 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.760
 low quality materials by sound 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.010
 what it does but it's nothing further from 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.040
 the reality because the mouse, although it is 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.500
 has a kind of 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.380
 the price premium is really quite 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.970
 good quality until here the unboxing of 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.530
 rises mamba 2012 I hope you have 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.020
 liked to subscribe you are yes 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.590
 you want more unboxing and until next time 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.590
 goodbye
