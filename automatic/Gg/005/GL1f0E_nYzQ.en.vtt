00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.040
 with arcelormittal a technique explain in just minutes 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.740
 welcome welcome for this triggering episode that was told every 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 segments have often caused to find a camera under the tree 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.119
 indeed every year shortly after Christmas but I see an increase in 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.659
 traffic on the big choices 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.220
 Thursday to all those people who just for a camera too 

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:26.239
 allows and wonders how to best use for the next eve 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.970
 the arrival of the new year 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.480
 this episode course presents three indispensable tips 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.090
 and a tip for those who want to go further 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.210
 first tip first do not get started in a series of photos 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 with a new device 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.640
 whatever 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.110
 without having taken the time to discover it 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.879
 discovering it means at least a quick tour of the instructions for use 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.060
 but mostly do some tests 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.340
 he especially paid attention to how we erase the photos how 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.910
 in proforma of the card which erases all the photos 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.560
 it's important to avoid committing the irreparable during the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.420
 Party 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 likewise if possible made some photos at night in conditions 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 close to those of New Year's Eve to find the setting or settings that gives 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660
 results that you like the most 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.630
 second advice commented on the sensitivity setting a little 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.799
 but be careful not too much because if you make three hours of noise 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 are the pictures which is unpleasant 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.740
 but a little 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.390
 I would say 200 to 400 iso for most contacts where they are at 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.850
 1600 iso for most DSLRs 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.060
 in two words the sensibilities determines how many billions 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.360
 of appliances needs 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.400
 and as the evening in general is not much light amiens it is necessary 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.120
 that the device is sensitive 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.750
 of course loitering will also act but pushing sensitivity 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.270
 was doing less solicited flash those who adopt deficits 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 first the battery will hold all night 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.400
 and then for technical reasons that I will not dwell on 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.430
 light should be better distributed in the picture 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.930
 do not forget to return to the default sensitivity setting 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.280
 the day after the eve 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.230
 third red gold board charge the battery to block 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.330
 do not laugh it's the same it's a mid-evening and in the same logic it 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.990
 emptied memory cards 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.479
 to be able to make the most photos 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.979
 that's not before leaving for Christmas Eve the next morning at 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.070
 next day 1st depending on the time at which you are lying 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.149
 edgar have a cd or burn a rival dvd photo 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.310
 if you left on your hard drive 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.839
 for claude would not be safe 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.669
 I had first thought is for those who want to go further 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.849
 modern cameras feature room mode 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.280
 trovoada how to use them how to implement them 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.720
 it's actually settings that she ignored shot in 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.509
 given photographic situations 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.579
 so the principle is very simple blow find a room in the user manual 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.629
 who corresponds to the person photographed before vaud she 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.509
 will appear better photos 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.019
 there are always several india motifs for the photos of him nude pics 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.149
 indoor portraits of a night of holidays etc. 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.379
 but clearly these are the five that correspond to the fact and in particular 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.389
 of revision 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.399
 but when we actively and often disappointed and because the photos are 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.259
 blurry 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.969
 because when the c5 of its assets it is necessary to avoid to move it is necessary 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.279
 reserve to left hand team topics the usually not announced 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.379
 the right setting for dancers or children for example 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.730
 I would not want to repeat myself but it is useful to do some tests with 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.299
 the number of jobs next to you 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.209
 notice that penn canceled accurate this day some doctors are booked 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.519
 to photos taken with a tripod so they are obviously not suitable 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.779
 for Christmas Eve 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:27.269
 choosing the right room among all the settings to photos should be 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.049
 better with particular colors more faithful 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.319
 I hope this race episode has been discovered your new device 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.599
 photo if you discover triggering at the same time walk around 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.950
 our markets we have more than 168 g pictures listen can listen to them on 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.870
 the site of course but it is so much more convenient to download them on 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.510
 the peeps a mp3 player a multimedia phone to take with you 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.949
 listen to them by car by subway ride brief brief 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.169
 like you want 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.819
 I would like that on the trigger site was also by blog 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.619
 we have notebooks yesterday afternoon with all the qualities of the photo 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.589
 if you are a faithful trigger I guess this 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.430
 episode did not teach them much 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 and passed on August 2 he can not find a camera under the tree 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.079
 and anyway I wish you on behalf of the whole triggering team 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.379
 a great year 2009 will be filled with the best photos 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.579
 who said we are but actually quite short finally
