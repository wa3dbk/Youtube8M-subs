00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.569 

I'm<00:00:31.300> looking<00:00:32.140> forward<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.560> having<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.340> kids

that the Victorian age built all the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.170 
that the Victorian age built all the
time<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:40.860> thought<00:00:41.860> why<00:00:42.220> not<00:00:42.430> drive<00:00:42.760> from<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
time I thought why not drive from the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.030 
time I thought why not drive from the
class<00:00:43.390> or<00:00:43.600> drive<00:00:43.930> something<00:00:44.530> from<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.830> past

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
I find a lot of the kids that I work

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.729 
I find a lot of the kids that I work
with<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:57.430> being<00:00:57.760> fed<00:00:58.090> science<00:00:58.840> technology

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
with are being fed science technology

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.190 
with are being fed science technology
engineering<00:00:59.890> mathematics<00:01:00.550> which<00:01:01.180> are<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.629> so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
engineering mathematics which are so so

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.170 
engineering mathematics which are so so
important<00:01:02.739> problem<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.730> how<00:01:03.940> do<00:01:04.000> we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
important problem is is that how do we

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:13.460 
important problem is is that how do we
foster<00:01:04.449> creativity

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860 

when<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.590> take<00:01:14.830> something<00:01:15.190> from<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.970> box<00:01:16.390> like

when you take something from a box like

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.590 
when you take something from a box like
we<00:01:16.900> took<00:01:17.290> here<00:01:17.710> how<00:01:18.310> do<00:01:18.370> you<00:01:18.640> make<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.180> your<00:01:19.420> own

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
we took here how do you make it your own

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.510 
we took here how do you make it your own
how<00:01:20.020> do<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.320> leave<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.710> own<00:01:20.890> mark<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.370> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
how do you leave your own mark on the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.640 
how do you leave your own mark on the
timeline<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:22.090> history<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.690> how<00:01:22.840> do<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.140> be

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
timeline of history and how do you be

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.780 
timeline of history and how do you be
creative<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:28.270> hoping<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.860> will<00:01:30.160> inspire

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
creative I'm hoping that it will inspire

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.550 
creative I'm hoping that it will inspire
other<00:01:31.180> people<00:01:31.330> not<00:01:31.840> only<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:32.050> tell<00:01:32.350> their<00:01:32.530> own

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
other people not only to tell their own

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.710 
other people not only to tell their own
stories<00:01:33.040> but<00:01:33.550> make<00:01:33.729> up<00:01:33.910> their<00:01:34.119> own<00:01:34.240> stories

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
stories but make up their own stories

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.290 
stories but make up their own stories
and<00:01:35.020> engage<00:01:35.710> what<00:01:36.460> they<00:01:36.640> already<00:01:36.820> have<00:01:37.150> on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
and engage what they already have on

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.040 
and engage what they already have on
hand<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.960> create<00:01:38.380> something<00:01:38.920> amazing
