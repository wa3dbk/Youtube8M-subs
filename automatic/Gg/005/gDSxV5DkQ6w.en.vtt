as<00:00:00.690> first<00:00:01.050> flight<00:00:01.350> around<00:00:01.589> our<00:00:01.829> solar<00:00:02.040> system

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
as first flight around our solar system

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.090 
as first flight around our solar system
here's<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> picture<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.179> Mars<00:00:03.650> by<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.680> way<00:00:04.920> this

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.190 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this
is<00:00:05.279> not<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.490> professional<00:00:06.089> tape<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.080> can

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
is not a professional tape as you can

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.480 
is not a professional tape as you can

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
see these pictures are in a picture

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.759 
see these pictures are in a picture
album<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.450> I've<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.750> got<00:00:09.960> my<00:00:10.110> camcorder<00:00:10.380> out

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769

and<00:00:11.160> Wendell<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.849> flipping<00:00:12.059> through

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
and Wendell and I are flipping through

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
and Wendell and I are flipping through
the<00:00:12.540> pictures<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> produced

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the pictures so this is not a produced

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.390 
the pictures so this is not a produced
tape<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> look<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.440> it'll

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
tape for you to look at so it'll

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.890 
tape for you to look at so it'll
probably<00:00:17.580> never<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> market<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.779> you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
probably never be on the market but you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.120 
probably never be on the market but you
least<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> chance<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.039> of

this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.359> Mars<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:22.020> from<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.289> different

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
this is Mars just from a different

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.439 
this is Mars just from a different
direction<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> Sun<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:24.000> bright<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.539> it

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
direction with the Sun very bright on it

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.019

now<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.560> Mars<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.369> here's<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> these

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
now here is Mars but here's one of these

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.089 
now here is Mars but here's one of these

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
heard about some of the the sedona plaza

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.679 
heard about some of the the sedona plaza
on<00:01:11.040> mars<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> face<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.240> Mars<00:01:12.450> that

been looking into building published a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
been looking into building published a
paper<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> 70s<00:01:18.330> talking<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
paper back in the 70s talking about that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
paper back in the 70s talking about that
there<00:01:19.799> was<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> race<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.700> lived<00:01:20.909> on

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there was a race that people lived on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.030 
there was a race that people lived on
Mars<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> terrible<00:01:22.890> catastrophe

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Mars they had a terrible catastrophe

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.240 
Mars they had a terrible catastrophe
about<00:01:23.820> 186<00:01:24.659> thousand<00:01:25.110> years<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
about 186 thousand years back at the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
about 186 thousand years back at the
time<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.790> about<00:01:27.030> 40<00:01:27.330> million<00:01:27.600> people

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
time there was about 40 million people

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740 
time there was about 40 million people
killed<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.409> Mars<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.119> they're<00:01:30.119> all<00:01:30.240> gone<00:01:30.479> now

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
killed on Mars and they're all gone now

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.399 
killed on Mars and they're all gone now
of<00:01:30.900> course<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> they're<00:01:33.240> worse<00:01:33.409> societies

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
of course so they're worse societies

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
of course so they're worse societies
there<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.340> find<00:01:35.579> quite<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.880> few

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there and we will find quite a few

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
there and we will find quite a few
remains<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.689> their<00:01:36.810> civilization<00:01:37.439> once<00:01:37.619> we

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
remains of their civilization once we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
remains of their civilization once we
get<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:39.180> he's<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.509> board<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
get up there here he's on board one of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
get up there here he's on board one of
their<00:01:40.320> large<00:01:40.590> mother<00:01:40.950> ships<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> the

here's Jupiter here's the mother ship in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
here's Jupiter here's the mother ship in

they'd<00:03:17.130> probably<00:03:17.310> find<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:17.910> hard<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
they'd probably find a little hard to

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.640 
they'd probably find a little hard to
believe<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.690> first<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.230> they<00:03:19.350> don't<00:03:19.530> have

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
believe at first but they don't have

these<00:05:24.030> anyway<00:05:24.449> from<00:05:24.630> back<00:05:24.840> there<00:05:25.080> but<00:05:28.010> just

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
these anyway from back there but just

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.740 
these anyway from back there but just
the<00:05:29.220> idea<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.729> someone<00:05:30.090> could<00:05:30.330> actually<00:05:30.479> go

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
back in time this really gets my brain

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.689 
back in time this really gets my brain
going<00:05:32.880> there's<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.930> bird<00:05:34.380> there's<00:05:35.220> these<00:05:35.400> eyes

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699
