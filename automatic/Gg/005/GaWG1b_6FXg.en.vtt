00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.770
 do not 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.739
 in our new video we tested the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 suzuki burgman 45 a maxi scooter devised 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.030
 for the city and in displacements of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 middle distance 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 Suzuki wanted to give it a little touch 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.010
 more sporty their design is more concise 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.059
 it's pretty conservative in soft lines 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 and refined in its great front we 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.180
 we found a double lens with the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.140
 integrated indicators on two 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.760
 air intakes 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.609
 designed to reinforce its image of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.679
 cut observing the details gives you the 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.179
 feeling of being huge seen the side 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.699
 right the feeling becomes more patent 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:04.769
 since the big silencer accentuates that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.600
 effect at the controls still seems 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.440
 extremely large to move around 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.910
 the city 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.649
 your big seat harasses us comfortably 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.789
 we have a practical support that 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.890
 We can adjust without the use of 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.300
 tools the posture is pretty 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.399
 made backwards the feet are going away 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.750
 forward if you close your eyes it seems 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.750
 that you are on the back of a person 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.079
 your instrument box from the most 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.549
 full of these speed readings 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.680
 revolutions gas level union of 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.240
 refrigerant temperature we throw in 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.460
 missing a reserve indicator light 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 However, neither can it arrive from design 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.880
 the only modern touch that we 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.570
 we found in the backlight in a 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 attractive tone 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.540
 its capacity is amazing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 under the feel we have room to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 two full-face helmets and some things 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.210
 under the handlebar we have two 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.650
 practical glove boxes and on the shield 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 front we have a glove compartment with 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.580
 key and rope socket 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.929
 ah 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.789
 once the size situation is underway 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.800
 does not just disappear however it is 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.300
 it's just an illustration and a few 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 minutes of rolling with her we move 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.800
 between traffic without problems 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560
 is to have a considerable weight 222 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.939
 kilos for the version with abs thanks to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.439
 its low center of gravity we can 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.720
 move without problems so much to low 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.400
 speed as the time to encompass in 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 city â€‹â€‹may seem very bulky already 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.790
 which is relatively long at 2 meters 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 20 though thanks to a turning radius 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.700
 surprising we can maneuver in places 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 very small 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.620
 its engine a single cylinder of 400 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.250
 cubic centimeters delivers 34 beds 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.989
 powered by electronic injection 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.480
 offers good accelerations of 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.670
 operation keeps cruises 220 more without 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 problems is satisfied with just over 4 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.970
 liters and a half to the times once 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.530
 out of town body we 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.150
 protects from the wind against so much 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.650
 body surface makes it more 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.900
 vulnerable to wind nothing 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.790
 on the fast roads its behavior is 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.500
 right is quite comfort to the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.079
 kilometers pass without realizing it without 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.670
 But you have to try the road the 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.290
 cushioning is comfortable both 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.790
 city â€‹â€‹like outside of it just 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.799
 road rolling with joy the note 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.180
 very white is that it is not made for 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.010
 roll with joy the suspension is 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.450
 responsible for notifying constantly 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.370
 prone set is shown capable of 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.530
 offer good braking double disc 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.530
 of 260 takes time to show signs of fatigue 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 Y 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.510
 you get used to rolling the passenger duo 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.910
 it will be shown very well treated on the web 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.440
 plus 400 with large seats handles 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.070
 so you can enjoy the displacements 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.070
 in total comfort 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.270
 the fog in 400 is a great candidate 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.310
 for our urban and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.800
 of medium distance in fact we do not 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.790
 We rule out occasional getaway 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.560
 we like the fact of not dragging 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.180
 the easel at all times however 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.950
 as soon as you warm up, you end up taking the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390
 overall quality is correct although the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.680
 windshield at a certain speed or 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.300
 rolling about other vehicles it 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.460
 moves it seems at any time it 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.900
 can break and we cut the profile the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.820
 Upper glove compartment lid looks like 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.740
 they are going to leave and it will not be necessary to see how 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.180
 he secret to the passage of friends not 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.950
 we could finish the video without talking about 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.940
 the mirrors are very worn 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.480
 they are practical but ugly heart 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.480
 ah
