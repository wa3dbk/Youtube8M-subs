sort of know where it comes from and I

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.890 
sort of know where it comes from and I
mean<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> music<00:04:07.640> was<00:04:07.760> Oliver<00:04:08.239> but<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.810> was

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
entirely new response to how he's

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.870 
entirely new response to how he's
feeling<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:45.010> influences<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.580> his

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880

feeling and the influences and his
personal<00:06:46.210> experiences<00:06:46.900> and<00:06:47.110> how<00:06:47.230> he<00:06:47.290> filters

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
personal experiences and how he filters

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.410 
personal experiences and how he filters
that<00:06:47.980> into<00:06:48.310> his<00:06:48.430> collection<00:06:48.910> and<00:06:49.030> it<00:06:49.120> really

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
that into his collection and it really

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.420 
that into his collection and it really
changes<00:06:50.230> every<00:06:50.470> season<00:06:50.680> but<00:06:51.040> I<00:06:51.160> mean<00:06:51.310> they

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
changes every season but I mean they

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.510 
changes every season but I mean they
were<00:06:51.490> still<00:06:51.700> very<00:06:52.080> identifiably<00:06:53.080> Marc<00:06:54.010> Jacobs

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
were still very identifiably Marc Jacobs

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.460 
were still very identifiably Marc Jacobs
I<00:06:57.000> think<00:06:58.000> that<00:06:58.180> he's<00:06:58.330> kind<00:06:58.750> of<00:06:58.900> the<00:06:59.020> only<00:06:59.290> one

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
I think that he's kind of the only one

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.020 
I think that he's kind of the only one
that<00:06:59.590> really<00:06:59.710> takes<00:07:00.100> like<00:07:00.340> he<00:07:00.520> just<00:07:00.730> takes

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
that really takes like he just takes

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.000 
that really takes like he just takes
