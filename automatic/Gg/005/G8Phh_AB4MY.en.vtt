and that would be a good job for him and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.390 
and that would be a good job for him and
so<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:14.430> didn't<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> wrestle<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.400> gonna

so he didn't have to wrestle and gonna

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.810 
so he didn't have to wrestle and gonna
have<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.970> hurt<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> injured<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.610> he<00:01:20.610> can

and pretty sure he probably lives in
Florida<00:01:27.420> cuz<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.659> where<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.930> Tina<00:01:28.229> was

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.080 

but<00:01:33.350> probably<00:01:34.350> won't<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> know

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.349

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
that mean i would really is

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.319 
that mean i would really is
probably<00:01:42.219> be<00:01:42.369> done<00:01:42.549> in<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.759> performance
