00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
Hello, everyone. I am Kimda from KIMDAX.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.300
Today you will learn the pink makeup easily and simply which is the steady seller of women and completes the young-looking face.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.100
Now, let's start.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.140
Step 1 for making baby skin

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.260
Apply the starter at both cheeks and bridge of the nose to direct the skin of quite gloss.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
Make the smooth and soft skin using the BB cushion.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.480
Apply on the eye flesh by pressing lightly.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.980
Make well-defined features

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.680
I'll let you know a beneficial tip to do eyebrow and shading with a shadow.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.440
First, fill the eyebrow naturally with shadow

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.060
Shade the bridge of nose with shadow remaining on the brush to make the sharp bridge.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.280
Cast a shadow to the eyehole naturally to make the mellow eyes.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.480
Now make the beautiful eyes using the pink shadow.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.820
Blend easily and naturally with your finger.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.940
This is a special tip.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.360
If you apply the red-circle shadow on the eyebrow lightly,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.660
you can direct the mysterious eyebrow matching the pink shadow more.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.220
Make the eyes in a mellow way

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.360
as if drawing the eyeliner with the brown shadow you used a while ago

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.020
and draw the eye line clearly on it.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.360
Now, the most important moist pink lip

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.720
Remove the lip color with the BB cushion you used a while ago.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.200
And apply the tint product moistly on it using the applicator shape.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.240
