technique to prosper at the same time to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
technique to prosper at the same time to
do<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.729> you're<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.300> people

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
do you see you're gonna get people

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
do you see you're gonna get people
though<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
though do you think they're going to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
though do you think they're going to
have<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.610> opportunity<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.570> can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
have that opportunity where they can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
have that opportunity where they can
literally<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.229> bring<00:01:49.620> someone<00:01:49.890> into<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
literally just bring someone into the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.520 
literally just bring someone into the
w/e<00:01:50.670> who's<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.360> come<00:01:51.510> straight<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> raw<00:01:52.290> or

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
w/e who's you come straight on to raw or

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.080 
w/e who's you come straight on to raw or
do<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.010> think<00:01:53.190> now<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> future<00:01:53.909> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
do you think now the future is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
do you think now the future is
everybody's<00:01:54.870> gonna<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.650> even<00:01:55.830> if

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
everybody's gonna have to go so even if

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.149 
everybody's gonna have to go so even if
they<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.100> bring<00:01:56.400> debit<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.830> somebody<00:01:58.830> from<00:01:59.010> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
they do bring debit in somebody from the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.740 
they do bring debit in somebody from the
Indies<00:01:59.430> they're<00:01:59.760> going<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> go

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
Indies they're going to all have to go

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
Indies they're going to all have to go
through<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> performance<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.130> think

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
through the performance I think I think

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
through the performance I think I think
that<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.760> will<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> case<00:02:03.390> purely

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that that will be the case purely

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
that that will be the case purely
because<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.470> actually<00:02:04.680> seems<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.250> working

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
because it actually seems to be working

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.149 
because it actually seems to be working
there<00:02:05.820> whereas<00:02:06.659> before<00:02:07.069> developmental<00:02:08.069> we

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
there whereas before developmental we

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.460 
there whereas before developmental we
know<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> hit<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.330> miss<00:02:09.470> now

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
know it was kind of hit and miss now

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.309 
know it was kind of hit and miss now
everybody<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.519> up<00:02:11.549> from<00:02:11.819> there<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
everybody that's come up from there the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.780 
everybody that's come up from there the
recent<00:02:13.319> years<00:02:13.680> has<00:02:14.159> done<00:02:14.340> really<00:02:14.489> really<00:02:14.610> well

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
recent years has done really really well

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.610 
recent years has done really really well
and<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> think<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.080> order<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.319> mold

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and I think you know in order to mold

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.080 
and I think you know in order to mold
them<00:02:16.830> into<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.129> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.519> performance<00:02:17.790> they

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
them into the kind of performance they

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.809 
them into the kind of performance they
want<00:02:18.299> make<00:02:18.930> sure<00:02:18.959> their<00:02:19.260> characters<00:02:19.819> tip-top

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
want make sure their characters tip-top

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.250 
want make sure their characters tip-top
they'll<00:02:21.299> go<00:02:21.450> therefore<00:02:21.749> even<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.049> it's<00:02:22.230> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
they'll go therefore even if it's just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
they'll go therefore even if it's just
for<00:02:22.379> six<00:02:22.650> months<00:02:23.040> yeah<00:02:23.370> no<00:02:23.700> one's<00:02:23.879> gonna<00:02:23.999> come
