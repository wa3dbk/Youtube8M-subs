00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.089
 what you want 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.080

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.670
 buy coins with 5% discount and I 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 submitted in less than 10 minutes to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.850
 then cousin 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 hello what guys that welcome here 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 a new video and good today I bring you a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 new peat look in this case I'm going 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 to bring from xbox one that a lot of people 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 he wanted them to be and well then here 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 you have it before I will comment one thing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.390
 quite important it's worth not having 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 nothing to do with this video and it's that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 tomorrow sunday I will upload a very video 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.150
 important that long ago that no 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 I was uploading to my channel, as you already know 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.379
 or for people who do not know it because it does 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.489
 climbed a time series that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.980
 I called channels that are worth 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 where I taught channels that I believe 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.610
 that under the point of view they were 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950
 pretty good channels and they deserved 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.300
 have a little more recognition 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.920
 normally these channels do not go beyond 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 the 5 thousand subscribers is worth for you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.880
 you make an idea and then I taught 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 me that I know 23 channels in that video and 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.450
 you have to go through those 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 channels and give them a chance is worth it 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.899
 this series especially lake so for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 help a little to the channels that have 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.369
 less followers to give a little 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 to know with this series do not do 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.840
 absolutely nothing is to say no 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.190
 they import the visits of my video I do not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 they matter the likes of my video me 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.390
 matters that come over for its canals and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.649
 that if you like your channel then or 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.209
 subscribe and all that I'll explain 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.409
 better tomorrow in the video but good 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.850
 I wanted to advise so that tomorrow 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.679
 you lose the video that I'm going to upload because 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.240
 quite important for channels that 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.009
 I'm going to teach so nothing 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.929
 talking about today's video or whether it's 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.939
 in my xbox wanda club we were going to 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.649
 start as always by extra position 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 make it a little more entertaining and let's 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.249
 to go through the front part if 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.569
 you want in this video and well we are going to 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.119
 search in this case as you are seeing 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.069
 pl because we have better we have it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.569
 mediapunta who is the one who gave a gift 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.640
 the five parties this ceded not what 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.929
 still used because I already appealed it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.880
 I tried a lot because a guy left me 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.380
 an account where I had hair and such and that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.349
 he sees it quite but well this one I have it 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.219
 saved for some special occasion 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.799
 we also have a futre that is a 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.909
 player that I liked a lot and that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.439
 I've left that I could have 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 sold but I've stayed because 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.560
 what it costs right now deserves 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.879
 very much worth it that you have it because 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.890
 for me it seems one of the legends 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.569
 The price of the best is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 pretty good after we have diego 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.989
 coast that I liked enough 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.269
 alexis sanchez that I thought 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.609
 incredible you already know by him for the fei 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.410
 so if we have to rooney girls 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.750
 aui and I think it's the is we have a peter 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.549
 crouch the breaker record is worth and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.130
 then we have the typical ones because that 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.220
 van persie falcao lewandowski 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.050
 diego costa cava ni rooney tv 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 the typical players is worth that we can 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.680
 have in the golden euro club 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 bright then we will go to the center 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.010
 of the field and here we have a few 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.570
 most have for example Valderrama 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.220
 it begins is it came out in an envelope that 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.690
 you are seeing first owner is a 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.340
 player that I like quite a lot 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.590
 people who do not give me a chance 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 I think it's pretty good and that now 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.340
 that is pretty cheap on xbox 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 you can take a look and you can try it 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.490
 because it's worth it then we have 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.080
 I would encourage totti that you already know is 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.300
 for the theme of fei such is a player 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
 incredible great after we have in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.170
 turís that is in the shift pedrón good no 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.450
 is happy what happens he has a hands of 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.310
 max then we have balls and tots 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.930
 uytsel fellaini and good here bay las 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.520
 Fellaini extra cost me quite 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.110
 find it the week it came out but 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.640
 Well the truth is that quite happy 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.350
 with him and I have some series thought with 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.850
 him for later but good and 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.460
 we have to fly if I think here this is 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.930
 the id or the shift I'm not sure and 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.960
 then we will do the typical iniesta 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.520
 river and until you get to hunt modric 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.170
 silva lahm 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.210
 james rodríguez di maría- normal götze 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.520
 royce the typical thing is worth the truth is that 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.990
 I have less special letters in xbox 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.490
 because as you know the coins are 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.190
 much much more expensive 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.990
 gameplay and then I have more options 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.330
 buy accounts and play talent because 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.870
 think the defensive apparatus we have 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.340
 to desailly and they speak worth of legend that 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.660
 diners use them the fake such that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.400
 the truth is that it goes pretty well 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.710
 very good both of them so it's true that 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.060
 like much more white desailly but 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.590
 they both go pretty well after we've 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.850
 a clichy shift williams line and van dyck 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.160
 Everyone is worth it, they all came out 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.500
 about less klain and then we have 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.940
 aurger I think this is the shift and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.430
 then we have some silver like 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.800
 estimate of belgium for the team of 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.840
 belgium we also have in bots and that is 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.190
 a neat player that I love 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.170
 last year I liked a lot and this 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.549
 I like quite a lot in Weemba 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.959
 It's also pretty good from the neat 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.520
 it costs very cheap all power is 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.020
 that is very cheap and for people 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.330
 that you want to be a problem because what 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.190
 I know I recommend you buy it later 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.440
 we have to de nayar it is a tops 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.790
 bronze from belgium as I'm watching 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.710
 with all these pretty good to be 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.780
 bronze the truth is that quite drying 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.840
 and then we have the typical sergio bouquets 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.210
 thiago silva hamels company boateng odín 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.490
 and all that and sport of two then in this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.120
 case we would be good doormen 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.190
 will combine well and from goalkeepers we have to if 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.680
 man legend 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.870
 and it is worth knowing that he is the son of 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.910
 mythical because it is more although it will come out 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.699
 it seems to me that the next Monday of the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.139
 legend and then we have culture h 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.289
 I digitally or quite a few 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.000
 templates that I have with this in this in 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.970
 this console so to speak where that the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.500
 xbox one as I said before obviously 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.000
 I do not have as many players as in play 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.349
 in place and that is pretty much everything 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.060
 I had a lot a lot a lot of 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.860
 all here as I said before then the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.300
 theme of the coins is more 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.380
 complicated here we have a equipillo like that 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.539
 more or less with all the homes that 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.159
 I have and well is not wrong the truth is 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.419
 that I have not tried it much the team what 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.490
 tried like two or three parties I what 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.460
 I will try more and good here you see some 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.569
 templates that I have I have the poly vale 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.039
 a neat square that the truth is 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.990
 that it's good enough to feel like 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.090
 upload this this team but as 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 lately we are so cool teams 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.990
 of silver and such I have not already raised it 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.509
 if they leave me many comments in the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.400
 video that telling me to upload it then 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.930
 equal the rise lopez and gods that not the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.659
 I have complete voucher as I am missing today 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.190
 many because I've finished doing it 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.900
 in play that I get cheaper 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.340
 and then we are a team from Colombia 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.710
 I have done it for them 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.630
 a team with arizala square james 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.220
 ward in tal is a pretty team 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.660
 pretty good if they will be missing 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.340
 some like for example jackson such 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.410
 but the truth is that equips enough 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.060
 well and good then we have others 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.040
 teams here in gypsy plan we have the 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.930
 Affected by Alexis is here he is 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.960
 saying the team full equipazo 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.660
 incredible the truth and some some 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.870
 another team around here have this d 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.610
 5 of tail that I need some player that 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.200
 I was going to make a 5- team ski 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.660
 here how she stayed with girl hauser mit 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.920
 and I'm a month or a half m 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.720
 team that has 5 good skill already 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.390
 I'll see what I do but let's go guys 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.370
 I'm seeing what I have the xbox 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.230
 and I do not have much either, so it's true that 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.030
 I have some legends some some 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.650
