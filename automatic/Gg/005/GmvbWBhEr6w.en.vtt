then you guys can download it for

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.020 
then you guys can download it for
yourselves<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:50.800> use<00:00:50.980> them<00:00:51.130> but<00:00:51.700> I'm<00:00:51.820> going<00:00:51.970> to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
yourselves and use them but I'm going to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
and then reselling them can yield wild

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
and then reselling them can yield wild
mounts<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.710> profits<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.550> back<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.860 
you know you think you're the first one
there<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.470> everyone's<00:02:30.130> some<00:02:31.090> how<00:02:31.240> fast<00:02:31.570> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
there but everyone's some how fast the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.450 
there but everyone's some how fast the
new<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.320> yeah<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.040> probably<00:02:33.280> what

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
new and yeah this is probably what

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.250 
new and yeah this is probably what
they're<00:02:33.580> using<00:02:33.760> as<00:02:33.970> well<00:02:34.120> actually<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:35.170> I'm

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
they're using as well actually but I'm

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
they're using as well actually but I'm
basically<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:35.950> program<00:02:36.250> does<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.610> it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
basically what this program does is it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.910 
basically what this program does is it's
an<00:02:37.090> autobio<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.990> can<00:02:38.290> set<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:38.620> into<00:02:38.890> a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
an autobio so you can set it up into a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440 
an autobio so you can set it up into a
shop<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.400> say<00:02:39.610> okay<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> want<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.210> go<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.330> the

magic shop and then I want to get
morphing<00:02:43.600> potions<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.800> what<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.190> do<00:02:45.370> is

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
morphing potions so what you can do is

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.730 
morphing potions so what you can do is
you<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.390> set<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.750> up<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> more<00:02:47.200> odd<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
you can set it up the more odd for the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.560 
you can set it up the more odd for the
shop<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.400> load<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> list<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> items<00:02:49.300> that

anyone else who's trying to grab it as
well<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.330> mean<00:03:13.840> basically<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.320> don't<00:03:14.470> have

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
well so I mean basically you don't have

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.720 
well so I mean basically you don't have
to<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.830> computer<00:03:15.040> way<00:03:15.280> doing<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
to be the computer way doing this you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.920 
to be the computer way doing this you
can<00:03:15.850> be<00:03:15.910> off<00:03:16.030> doing<00:03:16.180> something<00:03:16.480> else<00:03:16.630> or

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
can be off doing something else or

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.320 
can be off doing something else or
playing<00:03:17.200> games<00:03:17.470> or<00:03:17.890> whatever<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.970> don't<00:03:19.150> need

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to be restocking and it'll beat anyone

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.490 
to be restocking and it'll beat anyone
else<00:03:21.280> who's<00:03:21.519> trying<00:03:21.850> for<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.120> as<00:03:22.180> well<00:03:22.500> I've

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
else who's trying for it as well I've

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.130 
else who's trying for it as well I've
yielded<00:03:24.030> thousands<00:03:25.030> millions<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.630> profit<00:03:26.019> out

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
yielded thousands millions of profit out

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.900 
yielded thousands millions of profit out
of<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.320> actually<00:03:26.650> I've<00:03:26.950> actually<00:03:27.160> hit<00:03:27.550> over

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
of this actually I've actually hit over

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.490 
of this actually I've actually hit over
100<00:03:28.180> million<00:03:29.310> using<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.430> program<00:03:30.760> alone<00:03:31.630> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
100 million using this program alone and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.150 
100 million using this program alone and
I<00:03:32.709> mean<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.100> know<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.970> example<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:35.160> coronal

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
I mean you know for example a coronal

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.220 
I mean you know for example a coronal
morphing<00:03:36.519> potion<00:03:36.880> then<00:03:37.030> go<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:37.390> millions<00:03:38.019> and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
morphing potion then go for millions and

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.660 
morphing potion then go for millions and
you<00:03:38.320> can<00:03:38.440> buy<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.709> for<00:03:38.769> as<00:03:38.980> little<00:03:39.130> as<00:03:39.340> twenty

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
you can buy it for as little as twenty

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.490 
you can buy it for as little as twenty
thousand<00:03:40.090> points<00:03:40.269> from<00:03:40.540> neo<00:03:40.900> points<00:03:41.260> from<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
thousand points from neo points from the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.310 
thousand points from neo points from the
store<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:42.940> ya<00:03:43.060> know<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:43.720> basically<00:03:44.200> I've
