 against guzmán loera has faces 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.170
 that pushes a sentence of 20 years of 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.850
 prison my state information of 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.410
 tourist is or for the time being I was left without 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.840
 know by then they would still be 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.330
 several pending several inquiries 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.490
 previous not several orders of apprehension 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.590
 that were obtained by the attorney general's office 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.470
 general of the republic in the years in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.090
 that guzmán loera was imprisoned and well the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.630
 today's case that is a new 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 shape 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.810
 for organized crime in their 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.460
 way of committing crimes against 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.620
 health is one of them 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.080
 we know that there is in existence so 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.670
 minus six more orders of apprehension 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 then they will be complementing little to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.810
 little so that then the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.430
 respective processes and is that the judges 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.200
 consider that this is what 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.270
 yuri and good 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.220
 now it would appear as useless because 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.720
 the Mexican government practically already 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.360
 He let it be known that he will serve his sentence 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.550
 in Mexico but what happened to the protection 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.680
 who filed the defense yesterday for the 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.020
 late for the Chapo not 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.790
 extradited to us good this demand for 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.820
 Amparo should be noted continues its course 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.210
 he is granted temporary suspension 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.040
 for the judicial authority to ask 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.330
 officially to the authorities of the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.980
 federal government whether or not there is a 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.040
 request for extradition and as in the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.690
 case there will not be a request for 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.140
 extradition against guzmán loera 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.660
 possible simply this this judgment 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.310
 of protection will not have any more objective 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.820
 you have to keep in mind 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.850
 yury the audience also that 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.540
 principles of the presidency of the president 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.720
 Felipe Calderón good was given in a package 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.730
 to a large number of drug lords 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.830
 Mexico also operating in usa 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.530
 and that not necessarily not 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.570
 they necessarily finished their processes 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.540
 criminals here in Mexico and not 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.290
 necessarily faced a process of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.510
 extradition 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
 this is a very important antecedent 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.440
 then it is up to the government 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.110
 Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.750
 whether he delivers it or not in extradition when 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.420
 at the time the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.870
 temporary requests for extradition or 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.060
