 let us begin 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.640
 to make the dough we are going to mix all 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.520
 the dry ingredients two cups of 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.290

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.159
 and reserve for a moment I'm going to use 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 my electric mixer with a hook for 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.479
 knead but if you do not have a blender or 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.740
 it does not have the hook to knead you can 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.479
 mix the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 using a fork or with your hands 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.530
 clean since the dry ingredients 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.610
 are well mixed cut the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.220
 cold butter in small pieces 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.110
 turn on the mixer at low speed and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.420
 slowly add the butter on 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.880
 the dry ingredients mixes 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 low speed for 30 seconds and then 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 add vegetable shortening mix 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.140
 again for 30 more seconds and then 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.180
 Speed ​​up at medium speed and 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.830
 continue mixing for a minute more or 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.320
 until you have the texture of crumbs 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 of bread if you are mixing by hand 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.100
 It will take about two minutes in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.959
 get the same texture only 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.209
 press well the butter and the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 vegetable shortening on the flour until 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.410
 you have the texture of breadcrumbs 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.560
 reduce speed to the lowest and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730
 add water one tablespoon at a time 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.530
 make sure the water is cool 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.239
 the cold ingredients will allow 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.610
 our dough has a similar texture 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.739
 to the puff pastry dough I add 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.420
 exactly 6 tablespoons of cold water 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.120
 but sometimes you will need a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.310
 a little less a little bit more depends on the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.020
 type of flour that you are using since 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.690
 you have added all the water goes up 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.090
 speed to the highest and mix for 30 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.070
 seconds only so that the dough 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.019
 incorporate well if you are mixing the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.970
 ingredients by hand you only have to 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.190
 add the water slowly and with 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.710
 Fork works the dough until you have 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.270
 a smooth and firm texture this is the 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.850
 type of texture that we want to get 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.130
 as you can see it is firm and all the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.840
 ingredients are incorporated but it 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510
 see clearly that the dough is not over 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.940
 mixed let's refrigerate this dough 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.440
 at least 30 minutes or an hour before 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.390
 to use it 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.880
 30 minutes before baking bread 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.000
 preheat the oven to 450 degrees 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.060
 Fahrenheit or 230 degrees Celsius 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.400
 now let's do the lava lava filling 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.890
 and remove the center of the apples and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.660
 then cut them into slices my 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.940
 slices have a thickness more or less 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.100
 of a quarter of an inch but if you 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.370
 you prefer you can cut your slices a 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.750
 slightly larger a little thinner 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.480
 only not very thin cuts and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.490
 if more or they broke down in the oven already 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.500
 that the slices are ready we're going 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.470
 to plunder with one and a half tablespoon of 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.120
 flour a cup of sugar a spoonful 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.459
 of ground cinnamon a quarter of 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.860
 teaspoon of nutmeg a quarter of 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.959
 teaspoon of salt the zest of a 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.000
 yellow lemon a spoonful of juice 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.030
 a teaspoon of lemon 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.420
 Vanilla extract mixes well and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.280
 reserve for a moment 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.860
 the flour for me to it is already in the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.020
 refrigerator for at least 30 minutes like this 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.090
 that is already ready to be extended already 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.400
 clean and disinfect my work area 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.810
 which is where I'm going to spread my mass and 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.910
 I also add a little flour 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.980
 so that the dough does not stick to me I'm going to 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.450
 divide the dough into two sections one 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.700
 section will be a little bigger than the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.040
 another one and I'm going to start extending the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.770
 This larger section will be to cover 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.240
 my mold I will extend it 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.520
 enough for it to reach 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.889
 cover the whole background and around me 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.350
 mold I'm using a mold for pie 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.360
 9 inches since the dough has the 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.790
 desired size covers the mold with it and 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.430
 with a small knife cut any 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.139
 excess mass remaining around me 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.120
 leave about a quarter of 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.430
 inch mass hanging on 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.340
 edges of my mold and now I'm going to fold 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.290
 this excess of mass up 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.300
 and then with my thumb I'm going to press 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.830
 again this dough on the mold for 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 that we have a design a dollar 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.590
 since the mold is well lined with the 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.720
 mass let's add the filling of 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.450
 apple tries to accommodate everything from one 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.010
 uniform form only adds 2 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.560
 tablespoons of liquid that remained of 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.600
 our filling and add the ones on 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.000
 apples I take a spoonful of 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.650
 butter cut it into small pieces and 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.900
 place those pieces of butter 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.620
 about apple filling and reserve 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.930
 for a moment 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.600
 now we are going to extend the rest of the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.140
 mass extends enough to 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.930
 cover the pay and reserve for a moment 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.490
 Now let's make an egg varnish 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.270
 In a bowl, beat an egg with half 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.270
 a sugar tablespoon 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.920
 with this egg mixture we are going to 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.920
 varnish everything around the country 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.889
 place the rest of the mass on the country 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.840
 with a small knife cuts the excess 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.669
 of mass and with the thumb press 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.629
 around the mold so that the edges 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.629
 be well sealed 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.669
 to ensure that my country is well 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:14.169
 sealed after pressing the edges 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.169
 I'm going to turn them up a bit 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.370
 and again I'm going to press the 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.370
 down with my thumb 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.770
 varnish to the whole surface with the egg 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.200
 and with a small knife make a 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.860
 low down in the middle of the country so that the 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.710
 steam escape 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.710
 and we're going to bake this pay at 450 degrees 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.169
 Fahrenheit or 230 degrees Celsius 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.050
 15 minutes and then we will lower the 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.840
 temperature at 350 degrees fahrenheit oa 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.120
 180 degrees centigrade and we're going to 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.520
 continue baking for 40 or 45 minutes 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.270
 or until the country is ready and has 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.490
 a golden color 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.340
 and that's all good advantage 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.160
 this country delicious so you do not need 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.780
 of nothing else but if you like you can 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.759
 accompany with a little of the side of 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.759
 vanilla a little whipped cream 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.900
