ahead and do it like this do you see any
first<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.880> comparison<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
first a look comparison here that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
first a look comparison here that
something<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> looks<00:01:53.250> different<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.380> from

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
something that looks different and from

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
something that looks different and from
that<00:01:55.500> are<00:01:55.740> four<00:01:55.920> point<00:01:56.070> 0<00:01:56.130> points<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.579> version

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that are four point 0 points for version

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
that are four point 0 points for version
and<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.770> seemed<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.329> same<00:02:01.170> over

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and it kind of seemed like the same over

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.389 
and it kind of seemed like the same over
here<00:02:01.530> oh<00:02:03.170> wait<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> sec<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.680> any<00:02:04.860> blocking

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
here oh wait a sec we have any blocking

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.639 
here oh wait a sec we have any blocking
mode<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.829> i<00:02:07.829> suppose<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.649> are

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
mode and i suppose that it's like are

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.440 
mode and i suppose that it's like are
now

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
now

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600 
now
blocking<00:02:12.349> mode<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.709> enabled<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.430> have

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
blocking mode is enabled so you have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.850 
blocking mode is enabled so you have
some<00:02:13.790> kind<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:13.970> new<00:02:14.090> blocking<00:02:14.510> mode<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.959> also

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
some kind of new blocking mode and also

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.740 
some kind of new blocking mode and also
something<00:02:16.220> i<00:02:16.459> can<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.970> when<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.569> scroll

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
something i can see is when you scroll

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.339 
something i can see is when you scroll
