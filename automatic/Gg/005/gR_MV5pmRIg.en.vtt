00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.779 
as a matter of fact as soon as they get
to<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.649> end<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.920> runway<00:01:40.100> you're<00:01:40.700> gonna

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
to the end of the runway you're gonna

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.969 
to the end of the runway you're gonna
hear<00:01:41.179> me<00:01:41.210> reduce<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.960> RPMs<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.799> that's

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
hear me reduce the RPMs and that's

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.960 
hear me reduce the RPMs and that's
because<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.490> noise<00:01:43.640> abatement

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
because of the noise abatement

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.880 
because of the noise abatement
procedures<00:01:44.659> they<00:01:45.049> got<00:01:45.229> sensors<00:01:45.679> all<00:01:45.860> around

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
procedures they got sensors all around

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.700 
procedures they got sensors all around
down<00:01:46.429> there<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.939> front<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.539> they<00:01:48.170> will<00:01:48.319> go<00:01:48.470> off

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
down there in front and they will go off

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.050 
down there in front and they will go off
if<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.729> leave<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.030> at<00:01:50.149> full<00:01:50.329> power

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.350 

I've<00:01:55.510> reduced<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.170> RPMs<00:01:57.000> wersal<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.180> full

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
I've reduced the RPMs wersal it full

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.700 
I've reduced the RPMs wersal it full
power<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:59.290> 5000<00:02:00.010> feet

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.250 

the<00:02:05.190> ATC<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.180> gave<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.480> a<00:02:06.510> frequency<00:02:06.990> change

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
the ATC just gave me a frequency change

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.109 
the ATC just gave me a frequency change
so<00:02:07.620> I'm<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.920> gonna<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.520> fell<00:02:08.790> at<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so I'm actually gonna so fell at this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.480 
so I'm actually gonna so fell at this
one<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.290> checking<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.950> SoCal

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
one and then checking in with SoCal

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.480 
one and then checking in with SoCal
letting<00:02:12.450> SoCal<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.380> I'm<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.310> their

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
letting SoCal know that I'm on their

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:23.030 
letting SoCal know that I'm on their
frequency<00:02:14.700> now

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.880 

okay<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.870> we're<00:02:24.870> still<00:02:25.140> climbing<00:02:25.349> right<00:02:25.739> now

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
okay so we're still climbing right now

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.800 
okay so we're still climbing right now
we're<00:02:26.129> in<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.370> Cruz<00:02:26.610> climb<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.540> kind<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
we're in a Cruz climb you can kind of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.619 
we're in a Cruz climb you can kind of
see<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.110> airspeed<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.829> 100<00:02:29.220> knots<00:02:29.629> the

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
see the airspeed is about 100 knots the

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.869 
see the airspeed is about 100 knots the
manifold<00:02:31.079> pressure<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.680> 23<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.640> we're<00:02:32.790> not

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
manifold pressure is at 23 so we're not

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.220 
manifold pressure is at 23 so we're not
at<00:02:33.090> full<00:02:33.239> power<00:02:33.510> anymore

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
at full power anymore

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.280 
at full power anymore
we're<00:02:34.439> so<00:02:34.739> doing<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.069> goose<00:02:35.280> climb

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.190 

okay<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.340> agency<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.480> wanted<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.989> turn

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
okay so the agency just wanted to turn

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.160 
okay so the agency just wanted to turn
heading<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.860> zero<00:02:45.250> zero<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.629> can<00:02:46.780> see<00:02:47.019> I'm

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
heading to zero zero and you can see I'm

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.589 
heading to zero zero and you can see I'm
immediately<00:02:47.950> putting<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.519> heading<00:02:49.180> bug<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
immediately putting the heading bug on a

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.229 
immediately putting the heading bug on a
2<00:02:49.810> 0<00:02:50.049> 0<00:02:50.379> instead<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.459> always<00:02:51.730> follow<00:02:52.000> these

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
2 0 0 instead I always follow these

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.890 
2 0 0 instead I always follow these
heading<00:02:52.599> bugs<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.409> it's<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.650> lot<00:02:53.799> easier

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.410 

down<00:02:59.470> there<00:02:59.709> that's<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.129> torrents<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.790> coasts

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
down there that's the torrents of coasts

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:10.120 
down there that's the torrents of coasts
going<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.379> Palos<00:03:02.709> Verdes

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.520 

now<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.730> 8gc<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.600> calmly<00:03:11.870> turned<00:03:12.080> heading

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
now the 8gc just calmly turned heading

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
now the 8gc just calmly turned heading
one<00:03:12.950> seven<00:03:13.460> zero<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.810> again<00:03:14.840> turn<00:03:15.710> heading<00:03:16.190> bug

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
one seven zero so again turn heading bug

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.790 
one seven zero so again turn heading bug
and<00:03:17.510> I'm<00:03:17.750> slow<00:03:17.990> climbing<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.470> can<00:03:18.560> see<00:03:18.680> I'm

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
and I'm slow climbing you can see I'm

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.890 
and I'm slow climbing you can see I'm
still<00:03:19.040> 100<00:03:19.580> knots<00:03:19.790> climbing<00:03:20.420> at<00:03:20.480> about<00:03:20.690> five

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
still 100 knots climbing at about five

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:32.860 
still 100 knots climbing at about five
to<00:03:20.930> six<00:03:21.350> hundred<00:03:21.410> feet<00:03:21.770> per<00:03:21.980> minute

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
one seven zero you're gonna see about

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.479 
one seven zero you're gonna see about
six<00:03:39.319> four<00:03:39.500> five<00:03:39.620> hundred<00:03:39.799> six<00:03:40.129> hundred<00:03:40.159> feet

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
altimeter setting and they wanted to

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.490 
altimeter setting and they wanted to
turn<00:04:32.449> to<00:04:32.629> a<00:04:32.659> heading<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.080> 1<00:04:33.349> 0-0<00:04:35.169> as<00:04:36.169> soon<00:04:36.379> as

you check in the 80s and it's all you
this<00:04:39.050> is<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.469> altimeter<00:04:39.740> setting<00:04:40.189> that<00:04:40.789> way

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
this is the altimeter setting that way

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.219 
this is the altimeter setting that way
everybody's<00:04:41.449> in<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.659> same<00:04:41.719> altimeter

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
everybody's in the same altimeter

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.239 
everybody's in the same altimeter
setting
