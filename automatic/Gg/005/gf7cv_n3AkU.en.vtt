00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
I find that it helps to use my dry

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.810 
I find that it helps to use my dry
rubber<00:01:50.960> grout<00:01:51.290> floats<00:01:51.740> sort<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.130> tap<00:01:52.610> the

rubber grout floats sort of tap the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.760 
rubber grout floats sort of tap the
pebbles<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.420> I'm<00:01:53.960> going<00:01:54.260> to<00:01:54.320> start<00:01:54.590> at<00:01:54.680> the

pebble to be firmly embedded in the
inset<00:02:13.990> all<00:02:14.740> right<00:02:15.040> we<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.790> finished<00:02:16.210> our

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
inset all right we have finished our

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.720 
inset all right we have finished our
first<00:02:16.810> step<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:18.010> we've<00:02:18.160> still<00:02:18.340> got<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.490> ways<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
first step now we've still got a ways to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.630 
first step now we've still got a ways to
go<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.480> already<00:02:19.900> looking<00:02:20.380> fantastic

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
go but it is already looking fantastic

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.910 
go but it is already looking fantastic
now<00:02:22.120> before<00:02:22.420> we<00:02:22.450> grout<00:02:22.810> hour<00:02:23.080> pebbles<00:02:23.560> we'll

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
now before we grout hour pebbles we'll

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.460 
now before we grout hour pebbles we'll
need<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.220> add<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> coat<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> sealant<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:26.290> right

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
need to add a coat of sealant all right

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.550 
need to add a coat of sealant all right
so<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.160> want<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.400> mix<00:02:27.520> up<00:02:27.700> your<00:02:27.760> sealant<00:02:28.330> and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so you want to mix up your sealant and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.650 
so you want to mix up your sealant and
then<00:02:29.560> using<00:02:30.190> either<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.550> roller<00:02:31.060> or<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.480> brush

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
then using either a roller or a brush

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
then using either a roller or a brush
I'm<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.440> use<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> roller<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.880> want<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
I'm going to use a roller you want to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.870 
I'm going to use a roller you want to
apply<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.510> sealant<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.130> surface<00:02:36.460> of

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
apply the sealant to just the surface of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.820 
apply the sealant to just the surface of
the<00:02:37.150> pebbles<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:38.020> want<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> try<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.410> keep<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
the pebbles you want to try to keep the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.430 
the pebbles you want to try to keep the
edges<00:02:39.280> dry<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> grout<00:02:41.020> will<00:02:41.260> have

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
edges dry so that the grout will have

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.570 
edges dry so that the grout will have
something<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.890> stick<00:02:42.190> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
something to stick to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.330 
something to stick to
so<00:02:43.330> just<00:02:44.140> load<00:02:44.920> your<00:02:44.950> roller<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:47.340> apply

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
so just load your roller and then apply

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.050 
so just load your roller and then apply
two<00:02:48.400> sealant<00:02:48.940> top<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.660> bottom<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.830> this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
two sealant top to bottom just like this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
two sealant top to bottom just like this
over<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.450> entire<00:02:52.810> wall<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:54.070> be<00:02:54.310> sure<00:02:54.520> that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
between the spaces between the pebbles

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.970 
between the spaces between the pebbles
there<00:03:06.880> now<00:03:07.510> you're<00:03:07.660> gonna<00:03:07.840> cover<00:03:08.410> up<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.800> lot<00:03:08.950> of
