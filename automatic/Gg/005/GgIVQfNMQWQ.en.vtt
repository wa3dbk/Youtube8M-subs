gun<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> still<00:00:34.710> work<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> progress<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
gun this is still work in progress so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.990 
gun this is still work in progress so
these<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.450> there's<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.469> much<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
these two there's not really much of a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
these two there's not really much of a
difference<00:00:39.000> between<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.110> shot<00:00:40.379> gun

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
difference between these the shot gun

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.940 
difference between these the shot gun
shoots<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.910> fast<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.379> desert<00:00:43.829> eagle

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
shoots this fast this the desert eagle

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
shoots this fast this the desert eagle
and<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> m4<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.210> shoot<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> same

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and the m4 they all shoot at the same

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.350 
and the m4 they all shoot at the same
rate<00:00:45.899> however<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.219> m4<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> desert<00:00:48.210> eagle

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
rate however the m4 and the desert eagle

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900 
rate however the m4 and the desert eagle
are<00:00:48.809> weaker<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> shotgun<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.520> i'm

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
are weaker than the shotgun so i'm

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
are weaker than the shotgun so i'm
guessing<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> moderator<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
guessing the moderator will have to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670 
guessing the moderator will have to
expense<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:54.090> types<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.199> diamond

also<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> overpowered<00:01:33.540> having

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
also that be kind of overpowered having

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.940 
also that be kind of overpowered having
lots<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> diamonds<00:01:34.820> but<00:01:35.820> um<00:01:36.710> another<00:01:37.710> thing<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
lots of diamonds but um another thing is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
lots of diamonds but um another thing is
that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.610> keep<00:01:38.790> spamming<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that you can just keep spamming this the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
that you can just keep spamming this the
shotgun<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.380> shouldn't<00:01:40.650> shoot<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> fast

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shotgun really shouldn't shoot that fast

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.469 
shotgun really shouldn't shoot that fast
but<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> guess<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:44.070> shooter<00:01:44.579> does

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
but I guess you're a good shooter does

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
but I guess you're a good shooter does
that<00:01:45.689> even<00:01:45.869> work<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.579> also

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that even work that way you can also

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.399 
that even work that way you can also
just<00:01:47.880> hold<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.930> affected<00:01:49.320> by

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
just hold it and it's affected by

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
just hold it and it's affected by
gravity<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.100> see<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.000> anyway

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
gravity as you can see but it's anyway

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
gravity as you can see but it's anyway
uh<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.770> hit<00:01:52.920> kills<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.369> farm

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
uh this basically one hit kills all farm

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
uh this basically one hit kills all farm
animals<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.259> drops<00:01:55.890> down

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
animals if it does that also drops down

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
animals if it does that also drops down
as<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> pages<00:01:57.090> died<00:01:57.689> from<00:01:58.049> diamond

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
as can see that pages died from diamond
