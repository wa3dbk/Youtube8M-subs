00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:17.609
 it's about the climate skate make up for it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
 you need one 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.730
 moisturizing or day care 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.580
 But better is a moisturizer 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.560
 in the case of beggars I have that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 phone dampness intense 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.430
 concentrate then you need one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 bowl with water in it of course 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.829
 a sponge or beauty blender like 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.280
 Of course I have your cache here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 Make up in the right shade and what 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.719
 I still like to use is just one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 Powder brush around the whole then again 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 so a little too bland wenz 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 has given streaks when applying 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 yes the cup is a compressed powder 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.370
 water-based make-up 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.199
 So you can do it with water and one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.829
 Cleaner good again from the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.300
 skin is not a problem 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.549
 main component of cache make up is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.890
 That's why the mineral day will be the whole 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.240
 also very mark 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.510
 I have my kate make-up now from 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 the brand klimas that is in the area 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.650
 theater make up there are these products 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 and it comes in such a plastic 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.680
 title so you can easily so 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.240
 Slimming the lid are included now 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.560
 here 35 grams and it costs depending on 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.140
 providers around nine to twelve euros 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.479
 yes, it is durable after 36 months 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.759
 long but beyond it could 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.530
 Loosely still use straight in the theater 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 This kate make-up will be just a lot 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.840
 used to makeup characters 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.299
 also to paintings better durable too 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.689
 make that then serves as a basis 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.090
 and it's really extremely tagging and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.640
 dries very quickly after application 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 if you go to make up top.de where for example 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.409
 I have ordered this now 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.509
 you see from those shades there are 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.740
 really many colors and it is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.329
 really difficult because the right one 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 to find shade 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.020
 there are bright tones, middle tones and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.690
 dark tones 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.180
 but in the european area i would 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.970
 you advise the bright or maximum 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.680
 middle notes first to target 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.900
 you are really a very good girl now 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.600
 dark type otherwise there is still 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.920
 effect colors like black and white yellow 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.450
 if you are looking for something or need and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.590
 I also know that one or 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.120
 or I have that myself 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.070
 made that when I make up whether easy 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.920
 times have called and have such a 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.920
 little question which which 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 color would be best for me 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.320
 or which color for me am 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.090
 secret is appropriate and it would 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.410
 I actually recommend you because 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 it is really difficult and i have 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.150
 also ordered at the beginning that was 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.010
 then far too dark then I have 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.770
 still a shade ordered there was then 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 way too bright and then I have 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.370
 called and have with the lady times like that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.550
 talked a bit and that could 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.240
 then really help me and 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.810
 In the end I'll have it 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.130
 Matching shade can be found 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.690
 I want you just once today my 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.400
 colors I show here now so 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.680
 dahab that just like this one 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 impression war like the colors now so 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.240
 are and what is there 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.420
 okay i'm pretty pretty now 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.790
 bright colors but not only once 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.730
 So I have pfs espace here 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.470
 really a very bright color and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.040
 that is me too personally now too 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.040
 bright 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.709
 then I've got here once this is 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.810
 now zero 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 that is already now 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.920
 I would say it quite brightly 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 now too bright for the summer 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.900
 then i still have b 1 here and that is 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.260
 now a color that I currently have 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.940
 Can wear in the summer and give me something 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.730
 Anyway, too dark is what I am 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.260
 even then she is b2 so yes 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.940
 I have these four colors now 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.440
 will give you right now even here at 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.680
 Apply that her one more time 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.450
 See how it looks like and yes 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.090
 You see, that's just really 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.720
 compressed and if I just here 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.440
 I have 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.890
 see a powdery graceful finger 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.480
 really so low finish if you are 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.400
 just goes in with water 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.240
 will you see what? 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680
 happens here you see the color pal 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.550
 Face as I hold her on his hand 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 then cd go now 0 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.590
 where I have to correct myself g is 0 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.930
 a little bit lighter like pale face here 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.370
 you see now as once I then 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.820
 Apply to my complete face 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.530
 and here you see b2 again 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.530
 Personally, I would be too dark now 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.340
 and here you can see the colors again 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.340
 dried state 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.919
 Here I take my beauty blender 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.320
 really should be very moist 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.310
 almost wet and me all then 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.770
 and here you see how I do the whole thing 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.560
 on stretcher namely from the inside to the outside 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.330
 in hair growth direction really too thick 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.220
 Do not apply too often at the same 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.390
 know about it because there is 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.210
 These are stealing from those already 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.180
 have spoken and yes just quickly 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.350
 work and that kate make-up it 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.870
 really cover very well 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.650
 So who has pigment spots should that 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.650
 absolutely try it out 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.350
 Here I have mine again 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.970
 Brother brush a clean where I am 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.280
 just over the whole face again 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.050
 Just go for it all 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.430
 bit too blinding if streaking 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.390
 have emerged and here you see now 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.700
 the result 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.169
 You can also make up with your kate make up 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.370
 still like to go over their lips to 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.270
 the lipstick just keeps me longer 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.580
 hope you have a good first 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.530
 impression of the kate make up what i 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.940
 Personally I can say that 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.979
 I like to use it for video productions 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.140
 if I have to make-up because it 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.820
 just really well marked and holds 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.310
 otherwise for daily use 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.110
 will not use it on my own 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.970
 because especially if you are too small acne 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.400
 scars or quite a few small ones 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.860
 hair on the face it gets closer 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.310
 Contemplation already emphasized 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.160
 this extremely made finish and with me 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.780
 it is also pretty much in that 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.500
 a field after this couple of hours slips 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.810
 and just at under stockings it has 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.040
 Although such a great finish now if you can 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.730
 it now so at first impression 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.970
 but also looks like after a few hours 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.190
 I now skin it with my oily skin 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.450
 also again after powdering and for 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.920
 I would use the daily use now 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.230
 do not use 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.210
 but as I said that everyone must own 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.070
 just find out for yourself 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.330
 I'll try to link you, of course 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:08.570
 all the addresses where you buy this 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.760
 can also the sponge and yes 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.310
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.130
 and see you soon 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.280
 Of course I would like to return 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.800
 subscribe to 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.900
 and I'm happy if you like me 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.090
 a comment because if you have the cache 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.070
 have used make-up before or whether 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.390
 her also from another brand x 1 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.940
 have used because I really do 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.390
 only that of klimas and we know that 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.600
 just like that will be okay then all the way 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.600
 soon
