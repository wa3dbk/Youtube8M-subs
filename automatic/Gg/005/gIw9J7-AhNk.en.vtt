from<00:00:58.210> fusion<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.079> color<00:00:59.530> and<00:01:00.179> one<00:01:01.179> from<00:01:01.780> dash

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
from fusion of color and one from dash

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.060 
from fusion of color and one from dash
minerals<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.370> both<00:01:04.120> of<00:01:04.150> them<00:01:04.660> go<00:01:05.440> on<00:01:05.680> very

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
minerals and both of them go on very

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.510 
minerals and both of them go on very
similarly<00:01:06.790> they<00:01:07.690> are<00:01:08.050> very<00:01:08.470> they're<00:01:09.220> white

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
similarly they are very they're white

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.610 
similarly they are very they're white
because<00:01:09.970> they<00:01:10.150> have<00:01:10.360> no<00:01:10.600> color<00:01:10.930> pigment<00:01:11.440> in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
because they have no color pigment in

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.570 
because they have no color pigment in
them<00:01:11.830> at<00:01:11.980> all<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:13.840> put<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.370> can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
them at all and if I put that on you can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.930 
them at all and if I put that on you can
kind<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:16.000> see<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.580> very<00:01:19.440> white<00:01:20.940> base

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
kind of see that it's a very white base

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.230 
kind of see that it's a very white base
and<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.480> does<00:01:22.660> absorb<00:01:22.900> in<00:01:23.440> and<00:01:23.890> basically

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it does absorb in and basically

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.660 
and it does absorb in and basically
disappears<00:01:25.240> like<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.290> veil<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.980> these

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670
