00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.240
 Asking Mr. Four Valley

 Translation: ralianw 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 LRC: Momos 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.606
 Playing with the wind of the revolving 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.746
 The blue sky smiled at me a little. 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.460
 Yeah, in this sleepy noon 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.583
 My MOOK I have loved has died. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.533
 "Hate, hate, hate" 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 "can not breath" 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.113
 "The spring breeze is too strong" 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.286
 "bad premonition" 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.313
 "At the corner" 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.180
 "It hurts, hurts, hurts." 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.593
 "Let your neck" 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.886
 "With a warm air" 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.913
 "ruthless trap" 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.813
 "After the matter, please." 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.043
 When she is face to face with her 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.910
 Dark gray, the gloomy sky 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.003
 Already, I can’t go out from here. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.430
 Trapped the dirty, empty condom 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.206
 "near the future" 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.426
 "I was almost taken away." 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.703
 "Quickly taken away from dignity" 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.620
 "You are laughing at you" 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.416
 "I have to touch the dirty stuff, right?" 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.493
 "It's so cold, so cold, so cold." 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 "disgusting" 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.516
 "The spring rain is too big." 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.020
 "I don't like a smile" 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.586
 "In the head, echoing." 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.850
 "It hurts, hurts, hurts." 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.153
 "Let your neck" 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.386
 "With a warm air" 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.473
 "ruthless trap" 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.893
 "Ask your voice to Mr. Four Valley." 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
 Final
