00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.580
Hello boys and girls

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.760
This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.010
Called "In the Beginning"

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.630
Today's memory verse is from Genesis 1:31

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.400
It says "God saw all that He had made, and it was very good"

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.680
The message for today's story is "God made a wonderful world because He loves me"

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
Have you ever made a good picture of an animal and felt pleased about it?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.510
God made real life animals and a whole new world

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.790
And it was very good

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.650
One day, God decided to make a whole new world

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.750
He had a wonderful plan

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.850
God looked at a place of darkness and water

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.600
It was too dark to see anything

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.310
And there were no sounds except the sound of water

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.440
Then God spoke

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.720
"Let there be light," He said

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.400
And there was light

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.170
God divided the light and the darkness

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.340
The light He called "day"

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.830
And the darkness He called "night"

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.030
And that was the end of the first day of our world

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.950
And God said, "That's good"

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.380
On the second day, God created air and the beautiful blue sky to surround the new world

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.850
And the evening

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.030
and the morning

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.720
Made the earth's second day

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.480
The next day, God said, "Let the water under the sky come together"

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.990
"And let dry ground appear"

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.230
Suddenly the waters came together in certain places

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.960
And dry land appeared

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.050
God called the dry places "land"

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.380
And the waters He called the "seas"

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.820
But there was still more work to do on this day

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.820
God spoke again and the earth became beautifully green with grass and trees

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.960
Red and purple and yellow and orange flowers nodded in the gentle breeze

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.730
Plants and trees grew tasty things to eat

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.680
Before night crept over the land on the third day

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.900
God looked at all these beautiful and delicious things

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.770
He liked what He saw

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.770
And what do you think He said?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.670
It's good

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.800
The next day God said, "let there be lights in the sky"

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.190
And it was so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.010
The new brilliant sun shone on the earth by day

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.230
And that night, the moon threw moonbeams across the peaceful seas

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.970
Millions and millions

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.970
of tiny little stars

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.130
twinkled in the night sky

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.480
And what do you think God said?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.810
God said, "that's good"

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.720
Although the earth was beautiful, it was still a very very quiet place

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.500
But that was about to change

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.330
On the fifth day, God spoke again

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.650
"Let the waters be filled with living creatures," He said

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.960
And let birds fly above the earth

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.190
Dolphins and whales splashed in the sea

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.490
Brightly colored little tiny fish danced in the streams

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.510
Birds in every color chirped and squawked and screeched

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.920
and cooed

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.930
God blessed them all and said, "that's good"

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.010
When a new day dawned

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.650
God spoke again

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.340
This time He called for living creatures on the land

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.210
Great big animals

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.880
Like elephants and the hippopotamus lumbered across the earth

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.270
Lions and tigers swished their long tails

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.710
Kangaroos and rabbits hopped along

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.200
Puppies played and horses neighed

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.040
God looked at the beautiful world He had created

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.410
and He smiled

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.940
What a lively and lovely world!

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.990
And do you know what He said?

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.780
He said, "this is good"

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.780
And so it was
