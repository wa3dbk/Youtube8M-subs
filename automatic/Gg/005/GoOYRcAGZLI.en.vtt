00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
tiring you can see here my my fingers

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.450 
tiring you can see here my my fingers
just<00:01:10.480> get<00:01:11.480> around<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.890> can<00:01:13.070> form<00:01:13.340> a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
just get around it and so I can form a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.150 
just get around it and so I can form a
ring<00:01:13.670> with<00:01:13.880> my<00:01:14.030> hand<00:01:14.740> over<00:01:15.740> here<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.040> the

is<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:21.290> actually<00:01:21.680> feels<00:01:21.890> comfortable<00:01:22.430> I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
is this actually feels comfortable I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.280 
is this actually feels comfortable I
feel<00:01:23.150> like<00:01:23.270> I've<00:01:23.420> got<00:01:23.510> more<00:01:23.660> strength<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.200> my

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
feel like I've got more strength in my

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.110 
feel like I've got more strength in my

the<00:01:26.120> Apollo<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:27.170> guess<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.490> what<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
the Apollo I guess this is what the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.160 
the Apollo I guess this is what the
reach<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.180> would<00:01:29.330> look<00:01:29.540> like<00:01:29.690> without<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
reach it would look like without the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.170 
reach it would look like without the
pole<00:01:30.500> skin<00:01:30.830> which<00:01:30.980> is<00:01:31.160> quite<00:01:31.430> easy<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.850> move

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
pole skin which is quite easy to move

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.240 
pole skin which is quite easy to move
out<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.600> way<00:01:32.780> which<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.710> an<00:01:33.830> improvement

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
out of the way which is an improvement

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.120 
out of the way which is an improvement
but<00:01:34.670> again<00:01:35.570> you're<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:35.930> you're<00:01:36.680> not<00:01:36.710> closing

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
but again you're not you're not closing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.980 
but again you're not you're not closing
the<00:01:37.430> gap<00:01:37.640> here<00:01:37.910> between<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.360> palm<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:38.900> the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the gap here between the palm and the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
the gap here between the palm and the
tip<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.350> your<00:01:39.380> fingers<00:01:39.830> as<00:01:40.040> with<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.090> this

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
tip of your fingers as with here this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.390 
tip of your fingers as with here this
definitely<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.170> more<00:01:42.380> comfortable<00:01:42.620> pole<00:01:43.160> to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
definitely is a more comfortable pole to

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.240 
definitely is a more comfortable pole to
hold<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:44.630> will<00:01:44.900> affect<00:01:45.320> stiffness<00:01:45.920> because

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
hold that will affect stiffness because

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.580 
hold that will affect stiffness because
the<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.300> fat<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.720> pole<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.290> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the the the fat of the pole is the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
the the the fat of the pole is the
stiffer<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.940> there's<00:01:50.120> less<00:01:50.300> material

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
stiffer it is so there's less material

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.230 
stiffer it is so there's less material
here<00:01:51.350> in<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> younger<00:01:51.860> but<00:01:52.340> nevertheless<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
here in the younger but nevertheless it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.780 
here in the younger but nevertheless it
it's<00:01:53.840> holding<00:01:54.350> up<00:01:54.500> quite<00:01:54.800> nicely<00:01:54.830> against<00:01:55.760> the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
it's holding up quite nicely against the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's not quite as stiff as these two so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's not quite as stiff as these two so
I<00:02:21.170> don't<00:02:22.040> actually<00:02:22.220> think<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.940> high

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
I don't actually think this is a high

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.930 
I don't actually think this is a high

to<00:02:29.630> me<00:02:29.780> looks<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.440> lot<00:02:30.680> stiffer<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.390> end

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
to me looks a lot stiffer but in the end

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.600 
to me looks a lot stiffer but in the end
it's<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.830> brush<00:02:34.040> height<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.430> very

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
it's it's the brush height it's very

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's it's the brush height it's very
similar<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.750> Richard<00:02:36.140> Pro<00:02:36.410> I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
similar to the to the Richard Pro I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.120 
similar to the to the Richard Pro I
think<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.760> has<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> lot<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.240> do<00:02:38.570> with<00:02:39.130> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
think it has a lot to do with the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.820 
think it has a lot to do with the
narrower<00:02:40.610> section<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.560> grip

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
narrower section of the of the grip

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.460 
narrower section of the of the grip
pieces<00:02:43.760> because<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.630> think<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.200> wider

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
pieces because I think the the wider

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070 
pieces because I think the the wider
that<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.190> diameter<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
that the diameter is of the of the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.949 
that the diameter is of the of the
bottom<00:02:48.380> sections<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.040> stiffer<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.490> pole<00:02:49.959> but

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
bottom sections the stiffer the pole but

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.470 
bottom sections the stiffer the pole but
as<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.470> see<00:02:51.530> as<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.340> pole<00:02:52.610> extends<00:02:53.270> out

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
as you can see as the pole extends out

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.530 
as you can see as the pole extends out
the<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.950> reach<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.580> starts<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> flex<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.510> little

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180 
younger in light up here at the end now
the<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.760> Apollo<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.840> good<00:03:18.410> four<00:03:18.650> feet<00:03:18.920> back

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the the Apollo is a good four feet back

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.040 
the the Apollo is a good four feet back
so<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.519> not<00:03:19.610> quite<00:03:19.880> as<00:03:20.030> long<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.450> pole<00:03:20.780> and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
so it's not quite as long this pole and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.900 
so it's not quite as long this pole and
clearly<00:03:21.560> not<00:03:21.680> quite<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.100> stiff<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:22.580> it's

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
clearly not quite as stiff but it's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.270 
clearly not quite as stiff but it's

still a handy poll that shows good
stiffness<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.360> these<00:03:26.780> brushes<00:03:27.140> aren't<00:03:27.560> light

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.820

you<00:03:30.200> know<00:03:30.350> it's<00:03:31.010> 400<00:03:31.790> grams<00:03:32.120> or<00:03:32.420> 450<00:03:33.320> grams<00:03:33.560> so

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
you know it's 400 grams or 450 grams so

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.259 
you know it's 400 grams or 450 grams so
they're<00:03:33.980> weighing<00:03:34.190> quite<00:03:34.580> heavily<00:03:34.850> on<00:03:35.180> the
