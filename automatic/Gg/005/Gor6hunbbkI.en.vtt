 a review as you have already seen up 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.129
 I'm doing a lot of reviews lately 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.720
 but it's because I realize that in my 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.579
 channel there was not much is a product 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.230
 that I bought myself according to whether it's a 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.689
 product that I bought it I always 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.189
 I say okay but in this case I recorded 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.560
 a couple of reviews there are together and they are 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.810
 products that I bought myself good at 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.410
 this case I'll talk to you the dust of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.290
 bours java rice goes 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.690
 it's a much-loved product is a 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.420
 very desired product is a good product 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.100
 I stumbled upon the by chance and well 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690
 I remembered some of you that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.059
 you put on fire that a taste that you 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 I liked it a lot then I bought it without 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.480
 try it with nothing because nobody in 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.550
 that moment I took and I met him 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 I commented this is good powder 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.629
 something I'm going to look at here it's worth because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.160
 another page of a bag to describe us 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.900
 all right 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.570
 what was founded itself is an edition 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.120
 limited that is something that I for example 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.460
 I did not know it's a limited edition and it's a 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.100
 villager delicious to me this challenge is what 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.110
 that puts us on the website I comment 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 Ãšrsula celebrates its 150th anniversary with 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.610
 an exquisite reinterpretation of his 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.320
 first historical kiss but best seller 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.360
 historic rice powder 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 Poor Rich left apologies for me 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 French because I have no idea but 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.790
 thanks to this powder your complexion will be 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.050
 cool as a rose in a stroke of 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 brush 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 well something that has mattered a lot to me is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.170
 what I did that puts that 2 million 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.620
 units sold every year beginning of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.290
 Last century 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.030
 it's a spectacular powder me since I 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.030
 I have not used another powder I know 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 All absolutely desballed is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.170
 a powder and curly as you have already 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.760
 heard is a powder that has a 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.000
 small pink tone 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.620
 and on the cover 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's closed but it's been there a little 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.240
 loose 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 I carry on my skin right now 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.150
 give me lines 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.680
 and now like on my skin it's a powder that 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.000
 uses a lot because it takes effect 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.580
 of the university I want but without 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 purpurin 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.880
 to see if I can catch them a little bit and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 that a switch 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.500
 Real girls had read a lot not what 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.030
 I had tried for the group I need 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 buy one more in case you remove it 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.420
 It is an illuminating powder but it is very subtle 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.519
 leaves a finished price on the skin of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 truth leave a legacy super nice me 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.870
 I think I had not put in a powder nor 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.930
 taken out so 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.890
 so subtle and proposing without glitter 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.360
 so we understand each other and well we go 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.700
 to keep reading a little better 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.350
 consider a free dust luminous 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.970
 ultra thin delicately pink and 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.920
 pearly that removes the complexion in a single 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.390
 gesture its velvety finish creates 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.890
 immediately a good face effect and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.750
 Baby skin that is true the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.920
 Mirandese made here puts it with its color 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 green anise and its decoration 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.350
 beautifully retro the rice powder is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.710
 Cava is worth collecting and even 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.980
 has an original wink that I do not know 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.900
 pay of the slogan okay that's the slogan 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.550
 I wanted to emphasize that to put factory 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.740
 special for the beauty of women 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.540
 of the ladies that is this phrase that in 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.480
 that I do not think it stops and very 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.670
 Care a currado the dust what comes 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.820

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.340
