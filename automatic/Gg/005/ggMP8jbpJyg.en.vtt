hey everyone okay so today isn't going

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.060 
hey everyone okay so today isn't going
to<00:00:09.970> be<00:00:10.059> a<00:00:10.090> makeup<00:00:10.420> tutorial<00:00:10.600> it'll<00:00:11.170> just<00:00:11.620> be<00:00:11.830> a

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
to be a makeup tutorial it'll just be a

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.030 
to be a makeup tutorial it'll just be a
video<00:00:12.690> comparing<00:00:13.690> and<00:00:13.990> contrasting<00:00:14.200> liquid

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
video comparing and contrasting liquid

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.230 
video comparing and contrasting liquid
latex<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:15.580> gelatin<00:00:15.880> I've<00:00:16.689> gotten<00:00:17.020> a<00:00:17.080> lot<00:00:17.230> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
latex and gelatin I've gotten a lot of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.189 
latex and gelatin I've gotten a lot of
questions<00:00:19.240> about<00:00:20.820> gelatin<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:24.810> liquid<00:00:25.810> latex

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
questions about gelatin and liquid latex

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.010 
questions about gelatin and liquid latex
like<00:00:26.500> what<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:27.490> know<00:00:27.609> what's<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.600> difference

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
like what you know what's the difference

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.689 
like what you know what's the difference
what's<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:31.480> do<00:00:32.199> you<00:00:32.410> use<00:00:32.680> gelatin<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.489> it<00:00:33.580> be

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
what's how do you use gelatin can it be

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.600 
what's how do you use gelatin can it be
use<00:00:33.850> as<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.090> substitute<00:00:34.720> for<00:00:34.920> liquid<00:00:35.920> latex<00:00:36.250> and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
use as a substitute for liquid latex and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.400 
use as a substitute for liquid latex and
so<00:00:37.449> I<00:00:37.780> just<00:00:38.350> wrote<00:00:38.590> down<00:00:38.620> some<00:00:43.410> similarities

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
so I just wrote down some similarities

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.819 
so I just wrote down some similarities
and<00:00:44.620> differences<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:46.570> I<00:00:46.750> miss<00:00:46.989> some<00:00:47.290> feel

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
and differences and if I miss some feel

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.139 
and differences and if I miss some feel
free<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.100> comment<00:00:48.460> below<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.829> if<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.190> feel

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
free to comment below and or if you feel

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.830 
free to comment below and or if you feel
like<00:00:52.329> I<00:00:52.480> said<00:00:52.750> something<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:55.270> don't

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
like I said something that you don't

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.110 
like I said something that you don't
agree<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.710> know<00:00:56.800> whatever<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:57.610> I'll

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
agree with you know whatever so I'll

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.889 
agree with you know whatever so I'll
start<00:00:58.449> with<00:00:58.739> similarities<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.600> get<00:01:01.719> that

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
start with similarities just to get that

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.340 
start with similarities just to get that
over<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:04.059> can<00:01:04.270> make<00:01:04.479> burns<00:01:04.869> and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
over with you can make burns and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.060 
over with you can make burns and
prosthetics<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.250> wounds<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.690> can<00:01:07.810> also

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
prosthetics and wounds and you can also

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.370 
prosthetics and wounds and you can also
add<00:01:09.090> color<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.210> or<00:01:10.750> add<00:01:10.990> your<00:01:11.020> like

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
add color and or add your like

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.230 
add color and or add your like
foundation<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.159> match<00:01:12.369> your<00:01:12.580> skin<00:01:12.760> tone<00:01:12.790> in

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
foundation to match your skin tone in

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.480 
foundation to match your skin tone in
both<00:01:14.040> obviously<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.640> know<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:18.010> lot<00:01:18.250> to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
both obviously you know there's a lot to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.670 
both obviously you know there's a lot to
consider<00:01:18.700> when<00:01:18.970> deciding<00:01:19.330> between<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
consider when deciding between the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.920 
consider when deciding between the
between<00:01:21.490> using<00:01:21.820> liquid<00:01:22.119> latex<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.600> using

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
between using liquid latex and using

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.530 
between using liquid latex and using
gelatin<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:24.340> because<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.820> know<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.920> do

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gelatin just because you know they do

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.539 
gelatin just because you know they do
look<00:01:28.540> different<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:30.659> feel<00:01:31.659> different<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
look different and feel different and it

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.020 
look different and feel different and it
depends<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.799> know<00:01:35.950> are<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.700> gonna<00:01:36.880> be

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
depends on you know are you gonna be

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.700 
depends on you know are you gonna be
wearing<00:01:37.240> makeup<00:01:37.479> for<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.840> very<00:01:38.049> long<00:01:38.229> time<00:01:38.470> are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
wearing makeup for a very long time are

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.600 
wearing makeup for a very long time are
you<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.500> be<00:01:41.590> moving<00:01:41.890> around<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:42.520> a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you going to be moving around in it a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.460 
you going to be moving around in it a
lot<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.150> know<00:01:43.270> those<00:01:43.780> are<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:43.990> lot<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.259> things

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
lot you know those are a lot of things

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.300 
lot you know those are a lot of things
to<00:01:44.770> consider<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.780> as<00:01:46.900> far<00:01:47.049> as<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.470> know<00:01:47.590> making

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
to consider so as far as you know making

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.760 
to consider so as far as you know making
the<00:01:48.939> effects<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.380> want<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.649> make

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the effects that you want to make

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.399 
the effects that you want to make
they're<00:01:51.040> quite<00:01:51.250> similar<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:52.570> would<00:01:53.170> say<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
they're quite similar I would say the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.870 
they're quite similar I would say the
only<00:01:53.530> difference<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
only difference is that the the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.350 
only difference is that the the
difference<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.590> effects<00:01:59.950> would<00:02:00.939> be<00:02:01.119> that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
difference in the effects would be that

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
difference in the effects would be that
liquid<00:02:01.689> latex<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:03.159> thinner<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.840> then

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
liquid latex it's thinner and then

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.699 
liquid latex it's thinner and then
gelatin<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.490> much<00:02:06.729> thicker<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.200> build<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
gelatin is much thicker you can build it

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.949 
gelatin is much thicker you can build it
up<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.950> lot<00:02:09.100> faster<00:02:09.579> than<00:02:09.850> layers<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.750> liquid

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
up a lot faster than layers of liquid

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.100 
up a lot faster than layers of liquid
latex<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.790> far<00:02:13.120> as<00:02:13.209> differences<00:02:13.750> there's

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
latex as far as differences there's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.569 
latex as far as differences there's
actually<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.190> lot<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.730> differences

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
actually a lot of differences

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.819 
actually a lot of differences
you<00:02:18.579> know<00:02:18.670> one<00:02:18.969> major<00:02:19.719> thing<00:02:20.079> is<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.500> liquid

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
you know one major thing is that liquid

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.979 
you know one major thing is that liquid
latex<00:02:21.189> is<00:02:21.459> its<00:02:21.760> pre-made<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.689> open<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
latex is its pre-made you just open the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.509 
latex is its pre-made you just open the
bottle<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.560> start<00:02:23.859> using<00:02:24.099> it

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
bottle and start using it

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.750 
bottle and start using it
gelatin<00:02:25.299> it<00:02:25.569> takes<00:02:25.780> prepping<00:02:26.140> time<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:27.159> need

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
gelatin it takes prepping time you need

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.490 
gelatin it takes prepping time you need
to<00:02:27.879> get<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.269> right<00:02:28.420> consistency<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
to get it to the right consistency and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.449 
to get it to the right consistency and
if<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.650> don't<00:02:29.829> have<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.099> at<00:02:30.219> the<00:02:30.340> right

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
if you don't have it at the right

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.110 
if you don't have it at the right
consistency<00:02:32.219> your<00:02:33.219> effect<00:02:33.549> might<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.909> come

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
consistency your effect might not come

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.990 
consistency your effect might not come
out<00:02:34.239> as<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.750> as<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:34.959> had<00:02:35.290> hoped<00:02:35.639> so<00:02:36.639> that's<00:02:36.819> a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
out as well as you had hoped so that's a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.440 
out as well as you had hoped so that's a
major<00:02:37.989> difference<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.709> know<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:40.659> that<00:02:41.079> aspect

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
major difference you know in that aspect

another thing is people have asked me a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.229 
another thing is people have asked me a
lot<00:02:45.489> um<00:02:45.730> does<00:02:46.180> gelatin<00:02:46.859> Hertz<00:02:47.859> take<00:02:48.189> off<00:02:48.370> it's

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
lot um does gelatin Hertz take off it's

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.539 
lot um does gelatin Hertz take off it's
actually<00:02:50.879> very<00:02:51.879> easy<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.659> take<00:02:52.870> off<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:54.280> can

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
actually very easy to take off which can

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.610 
actually very easy to take off which can
be<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> setback<00:02:55.090> sometimes<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.379> comes

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
be a setback sometimes because it comes

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.000 
be a setback sometimes because it comes
off<00:02:56.829> too<00:02:57.159> easily<00:02:58.439> but<00:02:59.439> no<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.859> actually

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
off too easily but no it actually

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.759 
off too easily but no it actually
moisturizes<00:03:00.970> your<00:03:01.000> skin<00:03:01.439> because<00:03:02.439> there's

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
moisturizes your skin because there's

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.020 
moisturizes your skin because there's
glycerin<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.609> which<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:04.030> natural<00:03:04.329> skin

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
glycerin in it which is a natural skin

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.610 
glycerin in it which is a natural skin
moisturizer<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.269> believe<00:03:07.569> yeah<00:03:08.109> it's<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.319> skin

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
moisturizer I believe yeah it's a skin

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.949 
moisturizer I believe yeah it's a skin
protectant<00:03:09.269> skin<00:03:10.269> softener<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.129> obviously<00:03:12.129> if

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
protectant skin softener so obviously if

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.929 
protectant skin softener so obviously if
that's<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.169> there<00:03:14.349> it's<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.859> make<00:03:15.819> your

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
that's in there it's going to make your

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.959 
that's in there it's going to make your
skin<00:03:16.180> actually<00:03:16.419> a<00:03:16.599> lot<00:03:16.780> softer<00:03:17.700> liquid<00:03:18.700> latex

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:18.969 
skin actually a lot softer liquid latex

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.089 
skin actually a lot softer liquid latex

on the other hand

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.189 
on the other hand
it<00:03:21.099> hurts<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.549> take<00:03:21.699> off<00:03:21.879> especially<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:23.049> you

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
it hurts to take off especially if you

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.619 
it hurts to take off especially if you
have<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.799> arm<00:03:24.010> hair<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:25.510> have

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
have it like on arm hair or you have

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.710 
have it like on arm hair or you have
peach<00:03:25.870> fuzz<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:26.199> your<00:03:26.379> face<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:27.720> definitely

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
hurts a little bit another difference is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210 
hurts a little bit another difference is

pretty<00:04:56.659> good<00:04:56.780> hold<00:04:57.139> maybe<00:04:57.710> some<00:04:58.069> edges<00:04:58.370> will

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
pretty good hold maybe some edges will

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.930 
pretty good hold maybe some edges will
lift<00:04:58.699> up<00:04:58.879> but<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.979> should<00:05:01.310> be<00:05:01.400> pretty<00:05:01.699> good

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
lift up but you should be pretty good

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.409 
lift up but you should be pretty good
with<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:04.400> gelatin<00:05:04.819> on<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.030> other<00:05:05.150> hand

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
with that the gelatin on the other hand

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.089 
with that the gelatin on the other hand
if<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.560> put<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.860> lot<00:05:07.400> on<00:05:07.639> on<00:05:08.180> one<00:05:08.629> area<00:05:09.099> it'll

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
if you put a lot on on one area it'll

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.700 
if you put a lot on on one area it'll
start<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.340> pull<00:05:10.550> off<00:05:10.729> I<00:05:11.060> was<00:05:11.360> doing<00:05:11.710> some

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
start to pull off I was doing some

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.899 
start to pull off I was doing some
zombie<00:05:13.129> mica<00:05:13.460> for<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:14.139> short<00:05:15.139> film<00:05:15.199> and<00:05:15.680> I<00:05:16.280> used

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
zombie mica for a short film and I used

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.490 
zombie mica for a short film and I used
gelatin<00:05:17.419> to<00:05:17.750> get<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.409> zombie<00:05:18.919> ask<00:05:20.500> decaying

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
gelatin to get like zombie ask decaying

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.430 
gelatin to get like zombie ask decaying
and<00:05:22.300> by<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.360> end<00:05:23.569> of<00:05:23.599> the<00:05:23.719> shoots<00:05:24.080> they<00:05:24.379> were

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
and by the end of the shoots they were

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.309 
and by the end of the shoots they were
just<00:05:24.759> just<00:05:25.759> dangling<00:05:26.419> off<00:05:26.659> their<00:05:26.870> bases

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
just just dangling off their bases

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.129 
just just dangling off their bases
because<00:05:28.029> there<00:05:29.029> it<00:05:29.270> was<00:05:29.419> just<00:05:29.599> such<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.779> heavy

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
because there it was just such a heavy

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.399 
because there it was just such a heavy
makeup<00:05:30.469> and<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:31.789> day<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.629> hold<00:05:32.930> on<00:05:33.139> that's

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
makeup and this day the hold on that's

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.800 
makeup and this day the hold on that's
not<00:05:33.770> as<00:05:33.949> strong<00:05:34.250> it's<00:05:34.430> liquid<00:05:34.729> latex<00:05:35.029> another

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
not as strong it's liquid latex another

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.540 
not as strong it's liquid latex another
difference<00:05:36.259> between<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.830> good<00:05:37.009> latex<00:05:37.370> and

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
difference between the good latex and

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.420 
difference between the good latex and
gelatin<00:05:37.940> is<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.539> you<00:05:39.259> can<00:05:39.500> use<00:05:39.710> liquid<00:05:39.919> latex

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
gelatin is that you can use liquid latex

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.360 
gelatin is that you can use liquid latex
to<00:05:40.610> keep<00:05:41.210> materials<00:05:42.080> on<00:05:42.229> such<00:05:42.620> as<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.800> bald<00:05:43.099> cap

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
to keep materials on such as a bald cap

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.559 
to keep materials on such as a bald cap
I<00:05:43.669> would<00:05:44.089> not<00:05:44.240> recommend<00:05:44.479> using<00:05:45.080> gelatin<00:05:45.650> to

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:46.569 
I would not recommend using gelatin to

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.260 
I would not recommend using gelatin to
adhere<00:05:47.569> bald<00:05:47.930> cap<00:05:48.199> it<00:05:49.069> would<00:05:49.190> just<00:05:49.370> look<00:05:49.520> weird

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
adhere bald cap it would just look weird

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.719 
adhere bald cap it would just look weird
so<00:05:50.629> with<00:05:51.440> liquid<00:05:51.770> latex<00:05:52.069> you<00:05:52.250> can<00:05:52.279> get<00:05:52.490> super

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
so with liquid latex you can get super

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.110 
so with liquid latex you can get super
thin<00:05:53.150> lines<00:05:53.449> to<00:05:53.810> blend<00:05:54.080> things<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.849> not<00:05:55.849> so

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
thin lines to blend things in not so

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.850 
thin lines to blend things in not so
much<00:05:56.300> with<00:05:56.539> gelatin<00:05:56.960> unless<00:05:57.409> you're<00:05:57.620> blending

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
much with gelatin unless you're blending

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.519 
much with gelatin unless you're blending
gelatin<00:05:58.550> with<00:05:58.699> gelatin<00:05:59.060> if<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.259> makes<00:06:00.440> any

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
gelatin with gelatin if that makes any

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.260 
gelatin with gelatin if that makes any
sense<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.039> like<00:06:01.279> if<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.490> have<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.669> prosthetic

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
sense so like if you have a prosthetic

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.180 
sense so like if you have a prosthetic
and<00:06:02.419> you<00:06:02.509> want<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.779> connect<00:06:03.139> them<00:06:03.319> together

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
and you want to connect them together

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.570 
and you want to connect them together
sort<00:06:04.699> of<00:06:04.849> you<00:06:05.779> can<00:06:05.990> use<00:06:06.139> gelatin<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:07.389> mask<00:06:08.529> your

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
sort of you can use gelatin to mask your

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.779 
sort of you can use gelatin to mask your
edges<00:06:11.050> one<00:06:12.050> cool<00:06:12.319> thing<00:06:12.560> about<00:06:12.740> gelatin<00:06:13.580> is

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
edges one cool thing about gelatin is

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.159 
edges one cool thing about gelatin is
that<00:06:14.949> once<00:06:15.949> you<00:06:16.940> you<00:06:17.240> know<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:17.449> have<00:06:17.599> it<00:06:17.629> in<00:06:17.839> a

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
that once you you know you have it in a

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.350 
that once you you know you have it in a
container<00:06:18.500> you<00:06:19.159> know<00:06:19.279> this<00:06:19.639> is<00:06:19.759> Vaseline<00:06:20.210> this

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
container you know this is Vaseline this

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.529 
container you know this is Vaseline this
is<00:06:20.479> not<00:06:20.629> a<00:06:20.930> container<00:06:21.500> but<00:06:22.250> um<00:06:23.289> if<00:06:25.089> you<00:06:26.089> use<00:06:26.360> it

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
is not a container but um if you use it

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.610 
is not a container but um if you use it
up<00:06:26.659> or<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.349> if<00:06:27.500> you<00:06:27.650> don't<00:06:27.770> use<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.039> all<00:06:28.310> up<00:06:29.620> you

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
up or you if you don't use it all up you

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.829 
up or you if you don't use it all up you
can<00:06:30.740> just<00:06:30.889> save<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:31.550> for<00:06:31.879> next<00:06:32.029> time<00:06:32.360> just

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:32.839 
can just save it for next time just

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.110 
can just save it for next time just
reheat<00:06:33.319> it<00:06:33.469> and<00:06:33.680> it's<00:06:34.069> ready<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.430> go<00:06:34.639> again

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
reheat it and it's ready to go again

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.950 
reheat it and it's ready to go again
and<00:06:35.659> you<00:06:35.779> don't<00:06:35.930> have<00:06:36.020> to<00:06:36.169> throw<00:06:36.440> it<00:06:36.560> out<00:06:36.649> like

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
and you don't have to throw it out like

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.640 
and you don't have to throw it out like
container<00:06:38.229> full<00:06:39.160> of<00:06:39.220> liquor<00:06:39.610> latex<00:06:40.000> because<00:06:40.210> I

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
container full of liquor latex because I

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.080 
container full of liquor latex because I
don't<00:06:41.650> think<00:06:41.889> you'd<00:06:42.009> want<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.250> reheat<00:06:42.729> the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
don't think you'd want to reheat the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.279 
don't think you'd want to reheat the
good<00:06:43.330> latex<00:06:43.990> I<00:06:45.960> would<00:06:46.960> just<00:06:47.080> smell<00:06:47.289> that<00:06:47.410> right

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
good latex I would just smell that right

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.110 
good latex I would just smell that right
yeah<00:06:50.289> I've<00:06:50.500> never<00:06:50.680> tried<00:06:50.979> that<00:06:51.190> before<00:06:51.370> but<00:06:51.849> I

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
yeah I've never tried that before but I

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.140 
yeah I've never tried that before but I
don't<00:06:52.360> think<00:06:52.720> that<00:06:52.930> would<00:06:53.080> work

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
don't think that would work

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.640 
don't think that would work
preheating<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:55.360> so<00:06:56.110> yeah<00:06:56.259> that's<00:06:56.500> all<00:06:56.620> I

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
preheating that so yeah that's all I

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.469 
preheating that so yeah that's all I
couldn't<00:06:57.009> really<00:06:57.099> come<00:06:57.340> up<00:06:57.490> with<00:06:57.520> right<00:06:58.419> on

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
couldn't really come up with right on

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.180 
couldn't really come up with right on
the<00:06:58.720> spot<00:06:58.990> I'm<00:06:59.289> sure<00:06:59.530> I<00:06:59.560> missed<00:06:59.889> some<00:07:00.160> things

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
the spot I'm sure I missed some things

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.990 
the spot I'm sure I missed some things
if<00:07:00.789> you<00:07:01.509> have<00:07:01.539> any<00:07:01.930> more<00:07:02.110> questions<00:07:02.560> about

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
if you have any more questions about
