what made manaphy such an amazing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
what made manaphy such an amazing
sweeper<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.280> guess<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.790> an<00:01:24.880> extent<00:01:25.210> because<00:01:25.420> it

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
sweeper I guess to an extent because it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.050 
sweeper I guess to an extent because it
could<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.320> use<00:01:26.530> rest<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.220> heal<00:01:27.430> up<00:01:27.610> all<00:01:27.850> its

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
could just use rest to heal up all its

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.730 
could just use rest to heal up all its
HP<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.830> then<00:01:29.830> successfully<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:32.229> out<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> lot

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
HP and then successfully take out a lot

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.350 
HP and then successfully take out a lot
of<00:01:32.770> different<00:01:33.340> Pokemon<00:01:33.760> with<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.060> because<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
of different Pokemon with it because it

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.870 
of different Pokemon with it because it
also<00:01:34.570> learns<00:01:34.810> tail<00:01:35.049> glow<00:01:35.229> but<00:01:36.130> hydration<00:01:36.760> on

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
also learns tail glow but hydration on

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.520 
also learns tail glow but hydration on
SWANA<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.420> actually<00:01:37.750> very<00:01:37.900> useful<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.320> well

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.100 
this Pokemon really will not be able to
take<00:01:52.420> super<00:01:53.320> effective<00:01:53.770> moves<00:01:54.159> at<00:01:54.549> all<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.110> it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
take super effective moves at all and it

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.660 
take super effective moves at all and it
has<00:01:56.320> just<00:01:56.530> really<00:01:56.710> little<00:01:56.799> defenses<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.520> if

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
has just really little defenses so if

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.429 
has just really little defenses so if
anything<00:01:58.090> hits<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.420> for<00:01:58.600> neutral<00:01:58.869> damage<00:01:59.229> it

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
anything hits it for neutral damage it

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.289 
anything hits it for neutral damage it
could<00:01:59.560> potentially<00:02:00.130> wanted<00:02:00.430> KO<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.909> if<00:02:01.090> it's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
could potentially wanted KO it if it's

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.190 
could potentially wanted KO it if it's
powerful<00:02:01.570> enough<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:03.780> unfortunate<00:02:04.780> side

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
powerful enough and my unfortunate side

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.810 
powerful enough and my unfortunate side
effect<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.920> fact<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.369> are<00:02:06.400> a<00:02:06.520> Flying

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
effect is the fact that you are a Flying

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.509 
effect is the fact that you are a Flying
type<00:02:06.939> so<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.840> will<00:02:08.019> take<00:02:08.259> 25%<00:02:09.189> of<00:02:09.250> your<00:02:09.340> health

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
type so you will take 25% of your health

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.399 
type so you will take 25% of your health
every<00:02:10.450> time<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:10.689> switch<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.049> if<00:02:11.169> there<00:02:11.319> is

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
every time you switch in if there is

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.759 
every time you switch in if there is
stealth<00:02:11.650> rocks<00:02:11.889> on<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.069> field<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> does

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
stealth rocks on the field but that does

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.120 
stealth rocks on the field but that does
not

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
not

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.550 
not
your<00:02:15.340> defenses<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.090> as<00:02:16.990> for<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.260> attacks

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
your defenses at all as for your attacks

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.410 
your defenses at all as for your attacks
though<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.580> either<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:18.910> physical<00:02:19.300> or

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
though you can either go physical or

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 
though you can either go physical or
special<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.170> pokemon<00:02:20.590> does<00:02:20.770> learn<00:02:21.010> AI

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
special but this pokemon does learn AI

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.010 
special but this pokemon does learn AI
way<00:02:21.880> more<00:02:22.090> special<00:02:22.450> moves<00:02:22.690> into<00:02:22.870> those

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
way more special moves into those

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.790 
way more special moves into those
physical<00:02:23.440> ones

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
physical ones

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.650 
physical ones
so<00:02:24.070> you're<00:02:24.250> most<00:02:24.430> likely<00:02:24.640> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> go

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so you're most likely going to go

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.840 
so you're most likely going to go
special<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.440> pokemon<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.640> eighty

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
special with this pokemon but eighty

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.330 
special with this pokemon but eighty
seven<00:02:28.300> based<00:02:28.900> attack<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.530> special<00:02:29.860> attack<00:02:30.130> is

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
seven based attack and special attack is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.400 
seven based attack and special attack is
still<00:02:30.520> very<00:02:30.640> usable<00:02:31.150> despite<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:32.260> being

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
still very usable despite it not being

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.800 
still very usable despite it not being
incredibly<00:02:33.100> high<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:33.520> some<00:02:33.730> other<00:02:33.910> special

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
incredibly high as some other special

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.450 
incredibly high as some other special
attackers<00:02:35.350> or<00:02:35.560> physical<00:02:35.920> attackers<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
attackers or physical attackers in the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.630 
attackers or physical attackers in the
game<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.690> last<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.410> speed<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.580> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
game and it's last that speed is that a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.000 
game and it's last that speed is that a
really<00:02:40.030> good<00:02:40.210> ninety<00:02:40.720> eight<00:02:40.870> meaning<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.770> it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
really good ninety eight meaning that it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.860 
really good ninety eight meaning that it
will<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.340> quite<00:02:42.580> fast<00:02:42.910> if<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.330> put<00:02:43.600> enough

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
will be quite fast if you put enough

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.590 
will be quite fast if you put enough
Eevee's<00:02:44.230> into<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> allow<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> lot

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
Eevee's into it and allow it to do a lot

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.450 
Eevee's into it and allow it to do a lot
of<00:02:46.630> damage<00:02:46.900> really<00:02:47.410> quickly<00:02:47.890> since<00:02:48.190> it'll

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
of damage really quickly since it'll

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.100 
of damage really quickly since it'll
hopefully<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.970> out<00:02:49.090> speeding<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.660> opponent

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
hopefully be out speeding your opponent

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.580 
hopefully be out speeding your opponent
but<00:02:51.120> those<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> stats<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.960> now<00:02:53.320> let's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
but those are the stats and now let's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680 
but those are the stats and now let's
take<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> look<00:02:54.100> at<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.520> set<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.450> for

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
take a look at the set that I have for

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.970 
take a look at the set that I have for
this<00:02:55.840> Pokemon<00:02:56.350> SWANA<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.720> similarly<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.620> Z

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
this Pokemon SWANA so similarly to the Z

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.310 
this Pokemon SWANA so similarly to the Z
Baraka<00:03:00.430> video<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.270> have<00:03:01.600> one<00:03:01.870> set<00:03:02.140> for

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
Baraka video I only have one set for

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980 
Baraka video I only have one set for
this<00:03:02.470> pokemon<00:03:02.920> but<00:03:03.580> again<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.300> one<00:03:04.510> set<00:03:04.840> that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
this pokemon but again the one set that

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.360 
this pokemon but again the one set that
I'm<00:03:05.140> showing<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:06.160> probably

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
I'm showing you right now is probably

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.960 
I'm showing you right now is probably
going<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.970> be<00:03:07.240> its<00:03:07.510> most<00:03:07.750> useful<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.640> first

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
going to be its most useful one so first

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.850 
going to be its most useful one so first
we're<00:03:10.270> gonna<00:03:10.330> give<00:03:10.630> SWANA<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.080> tip<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.530> nature

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
we're gonna give SWANA a tip in nature

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.770 
we're gonna give SWANA a tip in nature
to<00:03:12.100> increase<00:03:12.400> its<00:03:12.610> speed<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.210> decrease<00:03:13.570> its

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
to increase its speed but decrease its

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.750 
to increase its speed but decrease its
physical<00:03:14.140> attack<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.770> then<00:03:15.370> we're<00:03:15.490> gonna<00:03:15.580> be

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
physical attack and then we're gonna be

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.420 
physical attack and then we're gonna be
using<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> ability<00:03:16.630> hydration<00:03:17.560> which<00:03:18.310> is

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
using the ability hydration which is

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.410 
using the ability hydration which is
your<00:03:18.550> general<00:03:18.820> ability<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.600> make<00:03:19.840> use<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.110> rain

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
your general ability to make use of rain

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.270 
your general ability to make use of rain
effectively<00:03:22.420> that's<00:03:23.350> for<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.530> Eevee's<00:03:23.860> for

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
effectively that's for the Eevee's for

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.920 
effectively that's for the Eevee's for
for<00:03:24.460> HP<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> give<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.300> more<00:03:25.330> hit<00:03:25.660> point

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
for HP to give you one more hit point

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
for HP to give you one more hit point
meaning<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.100> will<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.640> an<00:03:27.880> odd<00:03:28.060> number

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
meaning that you will have an odd number

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.840 
meaning that you will have an odd number
of<00:03:28.750> hit<00:03:28.990> points<00:03:29.100> which<00:03:30.100> essentially<00:03:30.640> means

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
of hit points which essentially means

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.550 
of hit points which essentially means
you<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.120> switch<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.600> on<00:03:31.720> stealth<00:03:32.050> rocks<00:03:32.320> four

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
you can switch in on stealth rocks four

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.430 
you can switch in on stealth rocks four
times<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.160> still<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.460> alive<00:03:33.640> which<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:33.940> great

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
times and still be alive which is great

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.740 
times and still be alive which is great
as<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.980> other<00:03:36.310> Eevee<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.700> 252<00:03:37.240> are<00:03:37.540> going

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750

out<00:04:20.650> either<00:04:20.770> either<00:04:21.160> way<00:04:21.400> but<00:04:21.820> if<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.030> have

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
out either either way but if you have

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.410 
at certain some kind of hidden power
it's<00:04:27.729> really<00:04:28.000> up<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.120> you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
it's really up to you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.960 
it's really up to you
as<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.930> next<00:04:30.080> move<00:04:30.520> we're<00:04:31.520> gonna<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.820> with

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
as for the next move we're gonna go with

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.700 
as for the next move we're gonna go with
boiling<00:04:32.210> water<00:04:32.510> because<00:04:32.840> it's<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.230> really<00:04:33.500> good

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
boiling water because it's a really good

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.010 
boiling water because it's a really good
new<00:04:33.980> water<00:04:34.310> type<00:04:34.580> move<00:04:34.820> with<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.540> tea<00:04:35.720> based

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
new water type move with a tea based

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.380 
new water type move with a tea based
power<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.800> has<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.980> 30%<00:04:37.400> chance<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.180> burn

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
power and it has a 30% chance to burn

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.630 
power and it has a 30% chance to burn
your<00:04:38.570> opponent<00:04:39.020> which<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.710> very<00:04:39.920> useful<00:04:40.160> since

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
your opponent which is very useful since

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.240 
your opponent which is very useful since
this<00:04:40.790> pokemons<00:04:41.300> defenses<00:04:41.870> are<00:04:42.140> not<00:04:43.040> that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
this pokemons defenses are not that

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.880 
this pokemons defenses are not that
great<00:04:43.430> as<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:43.910> said<00:04:44.120> before<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.200> by<00:04:45.440> burning

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
great as I said before so by burning

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.530 
great as I said before so by burning
your<00:04:45.920> opponent<00:04:46.640> you're<00:04:46.850> decreasing<00:04:47.450> their

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
your opponent you're decreasing their

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.810 
your opponent you're decreasing their
physical<00:04:47.900> attack<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.530> thus<00:04:48.770> allowing<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.610> to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
physical attack and thus allowing you to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.330 
physical attack and thus allowing you to
at<00:04:49.940> least<00:04:50.120> take<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> hit<00:04:50.720> or<00:04:50.900> two<00:04:50.930> from<00:04:51.440> them<00:04:51.650> as

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
at least take a hit or two from them as

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.060 
at least take a hit or two from them as
for<00:04:53.150> its<00:04:53.270> next<00:04:53.480> move<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:54.050> is<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.560> new

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
for its next move it is a new

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.910 
for its next move it is a new
flying-type<00:04:55.790> move<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.570> has<00:04:56.690> 120<00:04:57.200> power<00:04:57.590> and

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
flying-type move it has 120 power and

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.300 
flying-type move it has 120 power and
70%<00:04:58.460> accuracy<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.810> it's<00:04:59.960> known<00:05:00.110> as<00:05:00.230> Gale<00:05:00.530> but

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
70% accuracy and it's known as Gale but

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.490 
70% accuracy and it's known as Gale but
if<00:05:01.460> there<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:01.910> rain<00:05:02.300> up<00:05:02.540> it<00:05:02.840> has<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> hundred

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
if there is rain up it has a hundred

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.530 
if there is rain up it has a hundred
percent<00:05:03.650> accuracy<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.300> only

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
percent accuracy so that only

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.350 
percent accuracy so that only
complements<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.620> set<00:05:06.890> even<00:05:07.070> further<00:05:07.370> and

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
complements this set even further and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.970 
complements this set even further and
one<00:05:08.630> great<00:05:08.840> thing<00:05:08.870> about<00:05:09.080> Gale<00:05:09.470> is<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.860> it

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
one great thing about Gale is that it

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.890 
one great thing about Gale is that it
also<00:05:10.160> has<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.520> chance<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:11.030> confuse<00:05:11.750> your

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
also has a chance to confuse your

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.110 
also has a chance to confuse your
opponent<00:05:12.070> which<00:05:13.070> could<00:05:13.310> potentially<00:05:13.460> allow

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
opponent which could potentially allow

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.780 
opponent which could potentially allow
you<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.690> survive<00:05:15.020> even<00:05:15.350> longer<00:05:15.740> because<00:05:16.310> again

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
you to survive even longer because again

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.160 
you to survive even longer because again
you<00:05:17.000> don't<00:05:17.120> have<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.360> best<00:05:17.540> defenses<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.080> the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
you don't have the best defenses in the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.690 
you don't have the best defenses in the
world<00:05:18.350> so<00:05:18.980> if<00:05:19.100> your<00:05:19.250> opponent<00:05:19.610> hits

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
world so if your opponent hits

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.790 
world so if your opponent hits
themselves<00:05:20.300> in<00:05:20.420> confusion<00:05:20.840> then<00:05:21.560> that's

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
themselves in confusion then that's

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.830 
themselves in confusion then that's
great<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.250> then<00:05:22.820> you<00:05:22.880> can<00:05:23.180> freely<00:05:23.480> attack

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
great and then you can freely attack

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.470 
great and then you can freely attack
again<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.230> next<00:05:24.410> turn<00:05:24.650> as<00:05:25.040> for<00:05:25.910> its<00:05:26.030> last<00:05:26.210> move

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
again the next turn as for its last move

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.930 
again the next turn as for its last move
it<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.110> rest<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.740> obviously<00:05:28.520> we're<00:05:28.700> going<00:05:28.820> to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
it is rest and obviously we're going to

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.880 
it is rest and obviously we're going to
be<00:05:29.060> using<00:05:29.390> that<00:05:29.510> as<00:05:29.720> your<00:05:29.750> primary<00:05:30.500> means<00:05:30.680> of

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
be using that as your primary means of

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.060 
be using that as your primary means of
recovery<00:05:31.310> seeing<00:05:32.210> as<00:05:32.420> this<00:05:33.140> is<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.410> hydration

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
recovery seeing as this is a hydration

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.130 
recovery seeing as this is a hydration
set<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:35.150> great<00:05:35.300> thing<00:05:35.540> about<00:05:35.600> rest<00:05:35.960> in

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
set and the great thing about rest in

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.040 
set and the great thing about rest in
this<00:05:36.230> situation<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.820> because<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.930> are

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
this situation is that because you are

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.130 
this situation is that because you are
putting<00:05:39.260> yourself<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.740> sleep<00:05:39.920> and<00:05:40.190> healing<00:05:40.640> up

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
putting yourself to sleep and healing up

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.070 
putting yourself to sleep and healing up
all<00:05:42.140> your<00:05:42.290> HP<00:05:42.760> you<00:05:43.760> immediately<00:05:44.540> wake<00:05:44.870> up

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
all your HP you immediately wake up

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.840 
all your HP you immediately wake up
because<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.800> hydration<00:05:46.190> at<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.550> end<00:05:46.670> of<00:05:46.760> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
because of hydration at the end of the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.910 
because of hydration at the end of the
turn<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:47.390> essentially<00:05:47.870> it's<00:05:48.080> free<00:05:48.380> health<00:05:48.620> and

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
turn so essentially it's free health and

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920 
turn so essentially it's free health and
you<00:05:49.310> don't<00:05:49.490> have<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.700> worry<00:05:49.880> about<00:05:50.030> staying<00:05:50.720> in

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
you don't have to worry about staying in

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.230 
you don't have to worry about staying in
for<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.320> sleep<00:05:51.620> turns<00:05:51.950> or<00:05:52.250> anything<00:05:53.000> like

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
for the sleep turns or anything like

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.290 
for the sleep turns or anything like
that<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.380> also<00:05:54.530> removes<00:05:55.160> any<00:05:56.030> other

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
that and it also removes any other

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.030 
that and it also removes any other
statuses<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.200> you<00:05:57.320> have<00:05:57.500> even<00:05:57.800> though

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
statuses that you have even though

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.730 
statuses that you have even though
hydration<00:05:58.550> would<00:05:58.730> still<00:05:58.970> do<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.270> anyways

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
hydration would still do that anyways

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.360 
hydration would still do that anyways
but<00:06:00.820> this<00:06:01.820> is<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.030> very<00:06:02.390> useful<00:06:03.350> set<00:06:03.830> for<00:06:04.100> SWANA

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
but this is a very useful set for SWANA

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.700 
but this is a very useful set for SWANA
and<00:06:04.670> probably<00:06:05.360> its<00:06:05.600> most<00:06:05.690> useful<00:06:05.990> set<00:06:06.410> that<00:06:06.590> it

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
and probably its most useful set that it

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.460 
and probably its most useful set that it
will<00:06:06.860> ever<00:06:06.980> utilize<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:08.540> is<00:06:08.930> very<00:06:09.170> shallow

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
will ever utilize it is very shallow

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.440 
will ever utilize it is very shallow
bootful<00:06:10.040> to<00:06:10.370> an<00:06:10.460> extent<00:06:10.760> meaning<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.240> it

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
bootful to an extent meaning that it

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.690 
bootful to an extent meaning that it
really<00:06:11.660> only<00:06:11.900> learns<00:06:12.230> flying<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:13.130> water<00:06:13.370> type

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
really only learns flying and water type

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.140 
really only learns flying and water type
moves

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
moves

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.940 
moves
obviously<00:06:14.780> because<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.200> is<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.350> flying<00:06:15.680> water

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
obviously because it is a flying water

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.660 
obviously because it is a flying water
type<00:06:16.270> but<00:06:17.500> it<00:06:18.500> doesn't<00:06:18.770> learn<00:06:18.890> a<00:06:18.920> lot<00:06:19.250> of<00:06:19.490> other

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
type but it doesn't learn a lot of other

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.730 
type but it doesn't learn a lot of other
like<00:06:20.120> unique<00:06:20.480> special<00:06:20.870> moves<00:06:21.080> that<00:06:21.320> could<00:06:21.560> be

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
like unique special moves that could be

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.340 
like unique special moves that could be
utilized<00:06:22.160> in<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.460> set<00:06:22.700> but<00:06:22.910> still<00:06:23.480> having<00:06:24.110> a
