the<00:02:10.490> bottom<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.150> baguette<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:11.810> see

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
the bottom of the baguette you can see

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.990 
the bottom of the baguette you can see
that<00:02:12.170> they<00:02:12.290> offset<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:13.070> zipper<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> little<00:02:13.820> bit

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
that they offset the zipper a little bit

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.020 
that they offset the zipper a little bit
to<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.470> bottom<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.370> that's<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.850> little

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
to be on the bottom so that's a little

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
to be on the bottom so that's a little
bit<00:02:17.210> more<00:02:17.360> thermal<00:02:17.780> efficient<00:02:18.230> than<00:02:18.380> having

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
bit more thermal efficient than having

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.450 
bit more thermal efficient than having
the<00:02:18.980> zipper<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.180> side<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.980> here<00:02:25.070> at<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
top there's a Velcro closure so if you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.210 
top there's a Velcro closure so if you
want<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.910> vent<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> sleeping<00:02:29.390> bag<00:02:30.010> from<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
tube so that keeps out unwanted cold air

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.640 
tube so that keeps out unwanted cold air
from<00:02:50.270> coming<00:02:50.480> through<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.990> zipper<00:02:51.290> and
