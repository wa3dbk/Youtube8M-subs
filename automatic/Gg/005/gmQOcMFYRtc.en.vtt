twenty<00:03:32.040> dollars<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:32.600> I've<00:03:33.600> been<00:03:33.780> using<00:03:33.959> it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
twenty dollars but I've been using it

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.390 
twenty dollars but I've been using it
for<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.290> while<00:03:34.410> now<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.890> there's<00:03:35.160> still<00:03:35.340> a

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.020 
yet though I might try it maybe with my
gel<00:04:10.530> eyeliner<00:04:10.860> cuz<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.220> can't<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.519> find<00:04:11.760> my
