doesn't do anything at the moment that's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.849 
doesn't do anything at the moment that's
all<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.680> might

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
all it is but this is what you might

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.320 
all it is but this is what you might
want<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.340> might<00:00:23.519> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.939> display<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
want you might want to just display the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.970 
want you might want to just display the
items<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.990> use<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> different<00:00:25.470> plugin<00:00:25.830> for

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
items and use a different plugin for

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
items and use a different plugin for
something<00:00:26.340> else<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.539> is

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
something else but I think this is

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
something else but I think this is
really<00:00:27.840> cool<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.349> works<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.800> well<00:00:28.980> but

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
really cool and it works really well but

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.550 
really cool and it works really well but
you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.029> use<00:00:30.359> them<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.660> shops<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.320> shop

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you how to make it infinite and to make

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.319 
you how to make it infinite and to make
it<00:01:37.470> infinite<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> /ic<00:01:39.500> modify

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
it infinite all you do is /ic modify

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.740 
it infinite all you do is /ic modify
infinite<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.329> true<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
infinite and then true so then this is

maybe because there's a sign above it
yeah<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:25.230> some<00:02:25.379> reason<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.769> doesn't<00:02:25.859> like<00:02:26.129> if

storage<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.730> then<00:02:59.819> right-click<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.599> could

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
storage and then right-click I could

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.690 
storage and then right-click I could
fill<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.049> up<00:03:01.139> players<00:03:02.069> would<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.340> able<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> buy

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
fill it up players would be able to buy

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.220 
fill it up players would be able to buy
it<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.299> wouldn't<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.599> able<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.750> sell<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
it but they wouldn't be able to sell to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.199 
it but they wouldn't be able to sell to
it<00:03:04.379> so<00:03:05.129> you<00:03:05.219> could<00:03:05.370> use<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.579> for<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:06.000> things

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
it so you could use that for your things

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.970 
it so you could use that for your things
like<00:03:06.450> dirt<00:03:06.689> and<00:03:06.719> sand<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:07.829> want

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
like dirt and sand that you don't want

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.229 
like dirt and sand that you don't want
players<00:03:08.189> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.489> able<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.639> make<00:03:08.790> money<00:03:09.000> from

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
players to be able to make money from

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.140 
players to be able to make money from
but<00:03:09.599> you<00:03:09.689> can<00:03:09.930> let<00:03:10.139> them<00:03:10.260> buy<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.879> think<00:03:12.060> it's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
but you can let them buy so I think it's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.580 
but you can let them buy so I think it's
