the blade so let's first talk about the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
the blade so let's first talk about the
sheath<00:00:23.480> shieff<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.279> it's<00:00:26.279> some<00:00:26.580> sort<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
maybe it's Kydex but I don't know the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.459 
maybe it's Kydex but I don't know the
sheath<00:00:31.410> isn't<00:00:31.890> molded<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> knife<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.840> you

see this detent right here that's one of
the<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> locking<00:00:38.640> mechanism<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> keep

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the that's the locking mechanism to keep

let's take a look at the knife verily
very<00:01:18.420> appealing<00:01:18.930> tanto<00:01:19.560> blade<00:01:19.880> got<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> nice

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
very appealing tanto blade got a nice

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
very appealing tanto blade got a nice
wedge<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.549> has<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.360> fine

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
wedge right here it has a very fine

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.050 
wedge right here it has a very fine
point

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
point

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
point
it's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> chisel<00:01:27.720> ground<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.500> flat<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's a chisel ground so flat on this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's a chisel ground so flat on this
side<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.079> ground<00:01:31.320> regularly<00:01:32.070> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
side and it's just ground regularly on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.160 
side and it's just ground regularly on
this<00:01:32.400> side<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.960> about

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this side so just a little bit about

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.950 
this side so just a little bit about
tantos<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.400> didn't<00:01:38.670> already<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
tantos if you didn't already know so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
tantos if you didn't already know so
this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> primary<00:01:40.799> point<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this is the primary point and this is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780 
this is the primary point and this is
the<00:01:41.970> secondary<00:01:42.450> point<00:01:42.810> called<00:01:43.170> au<00:01:43.350> Cote<00:01:43.950> which

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the secondary point called au Cote which

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.560 
the secondary point called au Cote which
helps<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.329> slashing<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> second

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
helps in slashing so it's like a second

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710 
helps in slashing so it's like a second
tip<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> material<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> coming<00:01:51.360> down

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
tip so as the material is coming down

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
tip so as the material is coming down
like<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.570> material<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> coming<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like as the material is coming down on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
like as the material is coming down on
the<00:01:56.460> blade<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.299> gets<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.930> second<00:01:58.409> point<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the blade it gets the second point as

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.880 
the blade it gets the second point as
it's<00:01:59.070> cutting<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.890> devastating

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it's cutting and it's really devastating

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.340 
it's cutting and it's really devastating
so<00:02:03.049> just<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.350> info<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.130> tanto

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
so just a little info about the tanto

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.869 
so just a little info about the tanto

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
thumb ramp it also adds the aesthetics

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.440 
thumb ramp it also adds the aesthetics
of<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.730> knife<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.790> handle<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.299> bit

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
of the knife the handle is a bit

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.449 
of the knife the handle is a bit
bittersweet<00:02:33.810> for<00:02:34.349> me

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
bittersweet for me

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.849 
bittersweet for me
I<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:36.389> how<00:02:36.569> they<00:02:36.719> wrapped<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.439> just<00:02:37.500> don't

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
I like how they wrapped it I just don't

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.330 
I like how they wrapped it I just don't
like<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.340> nylon<00:02:38.819> material<00:02:40.069> paracord<00:02:41.069> would

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
like the nylon material paracord would

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.429 
like the nylon material paracord would
have<00:02:41.430> been<00:02:41.639> better<00:02:41.939> but<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:43.019> know<00:02:43.169> as<00:02:43.290> this

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
have been better but you know as this

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.589 
have been better but you know as this
price<00:02:43.739> point<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.760> know<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:45.120> doesn't<00:02:45.480> really

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
price point I you know it doesn't really

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.030 
price point I you know it doesn't really
matter<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:45.989> me<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.989> know<00:02:49.079> I'm<00:02:49.379> sure<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
matter for me you know I'm sure this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.390 
matter for me you know I'm sure this
nylon<00:02:50.459> cordage<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.299> survive<00:02:51.989> some<00:02:52.439> elements

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
nylon cordage can survive some elements

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.899 
nylon cordage can survive some elements
so<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> wouldn't<00:02:54.480> worry<00:02:54.750> too<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:54.989> about<00:02:55.199> that

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
so I wouldn't worry too much about that

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.770 
so I wouldn't worry too much about that
and<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.650> these<00:02:59.459> lanyard<00:03:00.180> holes<00:03:00.449> that

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.849

gets<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.909> smaller<00:03:03.230> from<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.739> gets

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
gets a smaller from here and it gets

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.170 
gets a smaller from here and it gets
larger<00:03:05.629> it<00:03:06.949> you<00:03:07.949> could<00:03:08.129> fit<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.519> land<00:03:08.790> most

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
