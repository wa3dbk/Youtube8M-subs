00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 to see my father's old weapon 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.839
 see if it will be good and load everything but 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.839
 will have going nation 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.960
 ah 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.400
 and how are youtube people are 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.619
 here with a new video for the channel and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 this time it's a gameplay of the cop 2 and 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.920
 very well it's a pretty gameplay 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.320
 entertaining and when I say entertaining is 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.300
 entertaining gentlemen because very well 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.570
 because it's a temper that came to me 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.760
 a 60 and 85 only using pistolite is 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.010
 say that I think it's not something that looks 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.260
 every day I say at least at least 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.570
 I think that normally all people 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.870
 he carries his rifles assault rifles the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.280
 chingón ipad so well before 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.809
 I do not want to mention that the game does not 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.089
 it's been from the beginning 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.949
 but why because in the first in the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.690
 first round of because the domain is not 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.290
 rare that I bring domain or domain 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.000
 forgiveness in the first round was 16 4 if 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.409
 I'm not mistaken is to say that four of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.690
 the five times they kill me in all the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.790
 game are in the first round and apart 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.670
 what do I do say look at that look at that is 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.960
 that's just me I'm me Fernando did not kill 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 someone who is on his back with high 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.939
 magician but very well in the second round 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.560
 the show starts all but all the 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.780
 show takes place in the second 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.970
 round managed to pull out all 3 kits as 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.870
 can see are helicopter stealth world 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.290
 road 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.820
 so the truth could be with super 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.410
 gameplay quite entertaining because 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.290
 Imagine getting out the swarm alone 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.910
 with pistolitas but very well we go for 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.000
 there as the Spaniards say we go for 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.280
 there's a bad attack 45 muffler 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 only and the advantages first slow 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.020
 ghost and lightweight second scavenger 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.970
 and third extreme condition and mask 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.230
 tactics and in the lethal is to say in the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.200
 instead, look at that 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.540
 and watch out for him take and in the third 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 slot only and sorry the third what 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.730
 I'm talking and not confuse in the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.200
 place of the pomegranate walked the taken 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.620
 but very good 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.290
 as I was going to mention as well as 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.460
 send and mention skins tricks 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.990
 helicopter stealth world draw and 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.640
 swarm and look at that you have to have 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.650
 Care when we put the pistolita dt 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.300
 away because it's not designed for that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.530
 but very well one of the things that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 I wanted to mention are they can do 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.250
 advantages or disadvantages of carrying 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.050
 only pistolitas and as for the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 advantage we can say that we can run 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.550
 extremely care in 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 advantages we can mention that we can 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.810
 run extremely fast more with 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.540
 lightweight is to say that we can be 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.280
 to others on the other hand much faster than 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.780
 the enemy and very well I want to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.459
 mention in the return 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.980
 and at the most indicated time I return and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.090
 the clown has already arrived and I very well kill you 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.099
 very good 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.130
 there I want to mention something this looks like 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.599
 a little bit the trick of I have not seen you in 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.580
 the trick of the north seen already I know it 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.099
 they can not say we'll see each other 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.410
 with an enemy one hides simulating 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.450
 like he has not seen the enemy and then 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.190
 it surprises him and marks him as this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.110
 it was something similar if it can be mentioned 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.390
 only this time the enemy already 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.950
 I had obviously seen myself 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.720
 I wanted to kill by stabbing him and then throwing 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.239
 the tomahawk but when I run 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 I give him the advantage that he believes that 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.569
 that I am obviously at a disadvantage 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 I'm at a disadvantage because here I have 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.010
 gun and the middle and he had a sum 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.080
 chingón but at the moment that he me 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.730
 stop seeing and I return the one who has the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.230
 advantage because I'm practically because 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.269
 I am the one who decided when to leave and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.590
 when to surprise him can theoretically in 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.540
 advantage because I feel like I 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.879
 mentioning the pistolite and the psuv yes 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.319
 very well mentioning more of here already 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.640
 own to the furtive if I do not 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.900
 I'm wrong as I did not take the furtive one 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.879
 you can see that I'm recording it the way 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.120
 cinema as I always say but very well 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.739
 here in this world the swarm makes its 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.629
 work gentlemen of hunger makes its 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.099
 work there you can see what is what 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.069
 I was recording cinema mode because what 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.079
 shot like they sometimes do not go where 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.109
 is the doll but not always but 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.299
 very well pulled the world out of the swarm and 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.829
 as he mentions these gusts does his 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.629
 I work because they will see him 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.319
 next and I think you look at the 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.030
 feed 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.549
 there the little red circle that I have 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.590
 mentioned has also returned wow wow 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.230
 what beauty what beauty but more 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.669
 I want you to see the kill bill 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.129
 what I put the little thing in because 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.780
 they will see that it is a barbarity only the 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.430
 swarm and the world when more than anything 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.190
 the swarm there I think ya are going to see 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.449
 look here the future interests me but my 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.190
 interest there is not but mister is there but 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.500
 if it 's a bad month of the smile but my three 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.500
 life but it says the truth that quite 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.449
 but quite a massacre and then here 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.599
 capture my friend to the flag and 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.860
 we have the three flags something running 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.840
 that you die 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.130
 pity that time is to say 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.720
 the enemies could no longer grab 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.430
 no flag because at the moment 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.820
 they went out to grab a flag outdoors 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.500
 He was very hungry so it was a pity 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.090
 time is running out but imagine that 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.070
 we would have traced that I do not believe but yes 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.780
 it has been a comeback come and pulling me 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.940
 tomahawk like crazy I want to kill this 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.660
 being the last one I killed and fuck out 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.610
 the time 138 195 we lost that 268 5 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.180
 as I mentioned a pretty game 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.699
 good 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.259
 and good questions, I always want them 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.699

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.000
 comments 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.090
 which pistolite they think is the best 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.560
 afa and you see the b-23 boss that the 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.810
 shoot in 3 rafa I think many go 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.570
 to say that can 45 what am I 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.610
 occupying now the cab the cab 40 that is 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.080
 the last one and I do not think the dimension of 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.940
 the former really happened that I think is 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.990
 the worst but very well leave here below
