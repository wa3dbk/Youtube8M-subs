focusing<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.470> terms<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.790> terms<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
focusing on in terms of in terms of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
focusing on in terms of in terms of
using<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> tool<00:00:33.840> bar<00:00:34.110> would<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.040> two

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
using it as a tool bar would be the two

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.770 
using it as a tool bar would be the two
of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> icon<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.300> ones<00:00:36.600> are

of the icon there the other ones are

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.680 
of the icon there the other ones are
actually<00:00:37.670> sticky<00:00:38.670> operations<00:00:39.180> which<00:00:39.360> I'll<00:00:39.510> go

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
actually sticky operations which I'll go

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.020 
actually sticky operations which I'll go
over<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.200> second<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.910> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to actually track those two tools into

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
to actually track those two tools into
the<00:00:46.320> toolbar<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.520> I've<00:00:47.640> created<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the toolbar here so I've created in a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.250 
the toolbar here so I've created in a
toolbar<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> drag<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
toolbar I'm just going to drag it to the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
toolbar I'm just going to drag it to the
top<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> first<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.940> will

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
top right here so the first one will

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
top right here so the first one will
actually<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.840> off<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> switcher

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
actually turn off all of the switcher

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
actually turn off all of the switcher
functions<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.750> move<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> over<00:00:55.140> here

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
functions so if I move that over here

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.610 
functions so if I move that over here
and<00:00:55.739> click<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.760> button<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.899> now

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
basically my navigation is back to the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.560 
basically my navigation is back to the
default<00:01:00.510> scheme<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> max<00:01:01.590> used<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> no

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
default scheme that max used so no

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
default scheme that max used so no
longer<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.379> auto<00:01:04.619> focus<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.430> the

turn it on or off you have some other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.310 
turn it on or off you have some other
options<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:34.259> default<00:01:34.560> max<00:01:35.189> uses<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> rather

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
options by default max uses a rather

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
options by default max uses a rather
fast<00:01:37.320> means<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.070> zooming<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fast means of zooming in so if you have

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.710 
fast means of zooming in so if you have
a<00:01:39.360> fairly<00:01:39.840> small<00:01:40.310> scene<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.579> world<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.390> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
a fairly small scene or world you can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.030 
a fairly small scene or world you can
zoom<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.470> clicking<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> button

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
zoom in on it by clicking that button

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
zoom in on it by clicking that button
but<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.759> notice<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.119> pretty<00:01:45.360> fast<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
but you notice it's pretty fast and you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
but you notice it's pretty fast and you
can<00:01:46.110> sometimes<00:01:46.500> clip<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.979> rather<00:01:47.280> quickly<00:01:47.810> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
can sometimes clip in rather quickly so

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.560 
can sometimes clip in rather quickly so
you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.140> turn<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.890> feature<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.240> slower

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you can turn that feature to be slower

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
you can turn that feature to be slower
if<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.259> use<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> actual<00:01:53.070> map<00:01:53.460> navigation

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
if you use the actual map navigation

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.370 
if you use the actual map navigation
modes<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.390> we've<00:01:54.689> installed<00:01:55.079> within

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
modes that we've installed within

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.499 
modes that we've installed within
switcher<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.000> zooming<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
switcher so here you know zooming and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.789 
switcher so here you know zooming and
it's<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.079> sensitive<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.649> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's a little bit more sensitive and it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.959 
it's a little bit more sensitive and it
works<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.130> better<00:02:00.049> in<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.229> opinion<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> here

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
works a lot better in my opinion so here

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
works a lot better in my opinion so here
we<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.270> some<00:02:03.540> other<00:02:03.659> options<00:02:03.869> within

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we have some other options within

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
we have some other options within
switcher<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> lock<00:02:05.610> your<00:02:05.790> orthographic

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
switcher you can lock your orthographic

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.510 
switcher you can lock your orthographic
views<00:02:06.479> from<00:02:06.630> tumbling<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.280> try

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
views from tumbling so here if I try

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
views from tumbling so here if I try
telling<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.270> view<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.599> locking<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.110> if

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
telling my right view it's locking it if

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
telling my right view it's locking it if
you<00:02:10.349> don't<00:02:10.679> prefer<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.580> feature<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.060> can

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you don't prefer that feature you can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.670 
you don't prefer that feature you can
turn<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.599> features<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.319> off

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
turn these features on and off

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.259 
turn these features on and off
and<00:02:13.799> then<00:02:14.010> finally<00:02:14.219> there's<00:02:14.670> an<00:02:14.849> option<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
and then finally there's an option to

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then finally there's an option to
turn<00:02:15.750> off<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.620> are<00:02:16.829> on<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:17.310> quick<00:02:17.730> transfer

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
turn off and are on the quick transfer

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050 
turn off and are on the quick transfer
mode<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.019> that's<00:02:19.290> something<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.909> do

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
mode so that's something that you can do

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
mode so that's something that you can do
in<00:02:21.299> Maya<00:02:21.629> by<00:02:21.959> selecting<00:02:22.709> an<00:02:22.829> object<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> if

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
in Maya by selecting an object and if

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.179 
in Maya by selecting an object and if
you<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:23.909> into<00:02:24.060> any<00:02:24.269> mode<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.680> use<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
you go into any mode you can use the

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.830 
you go into any mode you can use the
little<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.730> gizmo<00:02:27.299> here<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.689> actually

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
little the little gizmo here to actually

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440 
little the little gizmo here to actually
move<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.189> you<00:02:29.489> use<00:02:29.519> your<00:02:30.000> middle<00:02:30.239> mouse

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
move it but if you use your middle mouse

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.879 
move it but if you use your middle mouse
button<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.959> actually<00:02:31.319> transform<00:02:31.739> it

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
button you can actually transform it

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:32.929 
button you can actually transform it
without<00:02:32.099> actually<00:02:32.459> hovering<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:32.819> cursor

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
without actually hovering your cursor

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.330 
without actually hovering your cursor
over<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.599> gizmo<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.620> works<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.950> any<00:02:35.129> one

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
over the gizmo and that works on any one

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.339 
over the gizmo and that works on any one
of<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.939> start<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.569> rotation<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.109> that

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
of you so you start a rotation on that

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.990 
of you so you start a rotation on that
and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.159> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.489> continue<00:02:38.909> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and then you want to just continue the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.369 
and then you want to just continue the
rotation<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.689> just<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:39.989> your<00:02:40.139> left

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
rotation you can just use your left

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.679 
rotation you can just use your left
mouse<00:02:40.530> button<00:02:40.859> that's<00:02:41.760> been<00:02:42.000> mimicked<00:02:42.329> now<00:02:42.510> in

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
mouse button that's been mimicked now in

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.229 
mouse button that's been mimicked now in
max<00:02:42.900> as<00:02:43.049> well<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.469> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.620> go<00:02:43.969> let's<00:02:44.969> try<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
max as well so you can go let's try to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
max as well so you can go let's try to
find<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.599> same<00:02:45.750> object<00:02:46.139> here<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:47.159> I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
find that same object here and if I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.759 
find that same object here and if I
start<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.180> rotation<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.109> that<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:49.470> with<00:02:49.530> my

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
start my rotation on that now with my

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.440 
start my rotation on that now with my
middle<00:02:50.069> mouse<00:02:50.189> button<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.519> continue<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.239> so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
middle mouse button I can continue on so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
middle mouse button I can continue on so
it<00:02:51.599> kind<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.079> matically<00:02:52.769> just<00:02:52.950> locks<00:02:53.159> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it kind of matically just locks your

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.640 
it kind of matically just locks your
selection<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.939> transforms<00:02:54.629> it<00:02:54.629> all<00:02:55.260> within

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
selection and transforms it all within

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.309 
selection and transforms it all within
that<00:02:56.430> mouse<00:02:56.700> button<00:02:57.030> press<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:58.109> I'm<00:02:58.200> just

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
that mouse button press so I'm just

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.690 
that mouse button press so I'm just
going<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.500> click<00:02:58.769> Save<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.219> close<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.609> go

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
going to click Save and close and go

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.800 
going to click Save and close and go
over<00:02:59.790> some<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> other<00:03:00.239> main<00:03:00.419> features<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.589 
commands is meant to primarily be used
with<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.579> keyboard<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:09.419> going<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
with your keyboard so I'm going to

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.750 
with your keyboard so I'm going to
switch<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.989> keyboard<00:03:10.349> section<00:03:10.739> find<00:03:11.609> that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
switch the keyboard section find that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.940 
switch the keyboard section find that
same<00:03:12.000> group<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.599> go<00:03:12.810> under<00:03:13.139> D<00:03:13.349> raster<00:03:13.799> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
same group and go under D raster and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190 
same group and go under D raster and
let's<00:03:14.519> assign<00:03:14.819> some<00:03:15.060> hockey<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.719> for<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
let's assign some hockey so for the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.719 
let's assign some hockey so for the
selection<00:03:16.500> lock<00:03:16.889> I'm<00:03:17.099> not<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> really

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
selection lock I'm not going to really

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.449 
selection lock I'm not going to really
focus<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:19.889> can<00:03:20.040> look<00:03:20.159> at<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
focus on that but we can look at the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.240 
focus on that but we can look at the
snap<00:03:20.849> angle<00:03:21.269> sticky<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.650> my<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:22.889> can

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
snap angle sticky so in my you can

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.990 
snap angle sticky so in my you can
actually<00:03:24.030> set<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:25.220> angle<00:03:26.220> snap<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.729> if<00:03:26.849> I<00:03:26.970> go

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
actually set up angle snap so if I go

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.379 
actually set up angle snap so if I go
over<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.449> and<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.870> hold<00:03:28.229> down<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.530> jakey<00:03:29.389> we

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
over here and and hold down the jakey we

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.020 
over here and and hold down the jakey we
can<00:03:30.569> we<00:03:31.229> can<00:03:31.409> rotate<00:03:31.620> based<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.909> specific

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
can we can rotate based on a specific

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.289 
can we can rotate based on a specific
snapping<00:03:33.989> angle<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.799> get<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.040> by

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
snapping angle and you can get that by

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.819 
snapping angle and you can get that by
going<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.569> double-clicking<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.530> actual

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
going and double-clicking on the actual

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.610 
going and double-clicking on the actual
rotation<00:03:38.430> tool<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.909> actually<00:03:39.239> set<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.840> snap

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
rotation tool and actually set up a snap

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.099 
rotation tool and actually set up a snap
step<00:03:40.949> size<00:03:41.159> so<00:03:41.430> right<00:03:42.269> now<00:03:42.299> it's<00:03:42.569> great<00:03:42.750> output

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
step size so right now it's great output

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.379 
step size so right now it's great output
with<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> jakey<00:03:44.099> I<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.489> actually<00:03:44.669> enable<00:03:45.269> it

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
with the jakey I can actually enable it

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.719 
with the jakey I can actually enable it
and<00:03:45.509> turn<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.439> on/off<00:03:46.709> just<00:03:47.159> by<00:03:47.310> holding<00:03:47.519> down

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
and turn it on/off just by holding down

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.909 
and turn it on/off just by holding down
the<00:03:48.000> jakey<00:03:48.389> so<00:03:48.569> you'll<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.049> when<00:03:49.859> I

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
the jakey so you'll see that when I

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.800 
the jakey so you'll see that when I
press<00:03:50.310> down<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.729> works<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.359> when<00:03:51.509> I<00:03:51.540> let<00:03:51.780> go

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
press down on it works and when I let go

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.020 
press down on it works and when I let go
it<00:03:51.959> turns<00:03:52.229> itself<00:03:52.379> off<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:52.949> that's<00:03:53.519> also<00:03:53.790> been

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
it turns itself off so that's also been

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
it turns itself off so that's also been
mimicked<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.540> Max<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.139> want<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.409> use

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
mimicked and Max so if you want to use

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.629 
mimicked and Max so if you want to use
the<00:03:55.620> same<00:03:55.829> hockey<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.579> just

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
the same hockey you can do that just

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.809 
the same hockey you can do that just
press<00:03:56.970> J<00:03:57.560> we've<00:03:58.560> also<00:03:58.769> incorporated<00:03:59.189> all<00:03:59.609> the

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
press J we've also incorporated all the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.629 
press J we've also incorporated all the
snapping<00:04:00.359> modes<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.169> Maya<00:04:01.650> into<00:04:01.949> max<00:04:02.400> as

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
snapping modes of Maya into max as

snapping modes of Maya into max as
sticky<00:04:03.000> functions<00:04:03.389> so<00:04:03.959> now<00:04:04.199> in<00:04:04.470> Maya<00:04:04.799> if<00:04:05.099> you

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
sticky functions so now in Maya if you

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.240 
sticky functions so now in Maya if you
have<00:04:05.669> an<00:04:05.970> object<00:04:06.419> and<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:07.379> want<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.859> snap
