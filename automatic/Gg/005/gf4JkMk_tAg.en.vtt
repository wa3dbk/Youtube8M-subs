00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.110 

so<00:02:43.110> what<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.530> might<00:02:43.680> ask<00:02:43.950> has<00:02:44.220> been<00:02:44.430> changed

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so what you might ask has been changed

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
so what you might ask has been changed
well<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:45.990> slightly<00:02:46.410> reworked<00:02:46.770> interior

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
well it has a slightly reworked interior

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.210 
well it has a slightly reworked interior
and<00:02:48.090> new<00:02:48.120> nose<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.440> saloon<00:02:49.860> at<00:02:50.040> least

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and new nose and on the saloon at least

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.970 
and new nose and on the saloon at least
a<00:02:50.520> new<00:02:51.090> rear<00:02:51.390> end<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:55.170> extraordinary<00:02:55.770> thing

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
a new rear end the extraordinary thing

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440 
a new rear end the extraordinary thing
is<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.400> although<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.819> changes<00:02:57.239> are<00:02:57.330> quite

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
is that although the changes are quite

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.960 
is that although the changes are quite
small<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.650> neither<00:02:58.980> looks<00:02:59.340> nor<00:02:59.489> feels

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
small this neither looks nor feels

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.059 
small this neither looks nor feels
anything<00:03:00.600> like<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.530> went<00:03:01.770> before

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.050 

now<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.130> first<00:03:05.430> thing<00:03:05.610> I've<00:03:05.730> got<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.940> talk

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
now the first thing I've got to talk

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.259 
now the first thing I've got to talk
about<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.020> grill<00:03:07.700> there<00:03:08.700> are<00:03:08.850> those<00:03:09.060> who

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
about is this grill there are those who

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.000 
about is this grill there are those who
say<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.780> makes<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.140> 800<00:03:10.709> look<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:10.980> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
say that it makes the 800 look like a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.520 
say that it makes the 800 look like a
Jaguar<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.060> therefore<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.720> good<00:03:13.080> thing

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
Jaguar and it's therefore a good thing

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.620 
Jaguar and it's therefore a good thing
but<00:03:14.400> equally<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.060> those<00:03:15.209> who<00:03:15.450> argue

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
but equally there are those who argue

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330 
but equally there are those who argue
that<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.080> last<00:03:16.290> time<00:03:16.500> Rover<00:03:16.920> puts<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.160> big

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
that the last time Rover puts a big

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.160 
that the last time Rover puts a big
chrome<00:03:17.790> grill<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.390> front<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> car<00:03:18.989> it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
chrome grill on the front of a car it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.830 
chrome grill on the front of a car it
was<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> vanden<00:03:20.160> plas<00:03:20.400> Allegro<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.390> it's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
was the vanden plas Allegro and it's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.720 
was the vanden plas Allegro and it's
therefore<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.560> bad<00:03:23.010> thing

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
therefore a bad thing

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.509 
therefore a bad thing
rather<00:03:24.569> less<00:03:24.900> contentious<00:03:25.560> are<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.980> engines

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
rather less contentious are the engines

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.729 
rather less contentious are the engines
now<00:03:26.819> as<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.030> said<00:03:27.180> before<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.750> v6<00:03:28.200> stays<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
now as I said before the v6 stays the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.030 
now as I said before the v6 stays the
same<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.700> there's<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> new<00:03:30.150> 2-liter<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:31.799> even

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
same but there's a new 2-liter now even

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.470 
same but there's a new 2-liter now even
though<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.280> got<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.459> catalytic<00:03:32.910> converter<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
though it's got a catalytic converter a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.539 
though it's got a catalytic converter a
standard<00:03:34.080> it's<00:03:34.290> still<00:03:34.650> more<00:03:34.860> powerful<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
standard it's still more powerful on the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.910 
standard it's still more powerful on the
old<00:03:35.700> one<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:36.930> can't<00:03:37.260> work<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.860> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
old one now I can't work out for the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.800 
old one now I can't work out for the
life<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.310> me<00:03:38.459> why<00:03:38.580> anyone<00:03:38.970> would<00:03:39.239> want<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.600> see

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
life of me why anyone would want to see

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.110 
life of me why anyone would want to see

it the Top Gear tradition does dictate

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.300 
it the Top Gear tradition does dictate
that<00:03:42.269> we've<00:03:42.420> got<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.630> bonnet<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.130> there

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
but to see that rover has been

for<00:05:14.140> this<00:05:14.260> si<00:05:15.160> model<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:16.570> might<00:05:16.720> imagine<00:05:16.960> that

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
for this si model you might imagine that

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.930 
for this si model you might imagine that
costing<00:05:17.680> nineteen<00:05:18.130> thousand<00:05:18.729> two<00:05:18.910> hundred

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
costing nineteen thousand two hundred

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.969

and fifty pounds the interior would be

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.909 
and fifty pounds the interior would be
stuffed<00:05:21.700> full<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.210> toys<00:05:22.479> but<00:05:22.930> instead<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.800> air

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
stuffed full of toys but instead of air

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.920 
stuffed full of toys but instead of air
conditioning<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.789> fun<00:05:24.970> anti-lock<00:05:25.360> brakes

conditioning and fun anti-lock brakes

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.930

instead<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.680> electric<00:05:27.070> seats<00:05:27.340> I've<00:05:27.700> got<00:05:27.910> a

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
instead of electric seats I've got a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.130 
instead of electric seats I've got a
burglar<00:05:28.360> alarm<00:05:28.500> door<00:05:29.500> makes<00:05:29.770> sense<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
burglar alarm door makes sense so the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.990 
burglar alarm door makes sense so the
new<00:05:32.260> rover<00:05:32.590> 800<00:05:33.070> is<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.220> whole<00:05:33.490> lot<00:05:33.640> better<00:05:33.820> than

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
new rover 800 is a whole lot better than

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.240 
new rover 800 is a whole lot better than
the<00:05:34.210> one<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.360> went<00:05:34.660> before<00:05:35.080> but<00:05:35.830> that's<00:05:35.979> just

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
the one that went before but that's just

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.159 
the one that went before but that's just
not<00:05:36.400> good<00:05:36.610> enough<00:05:36.820> because<00:05:37.180> if<00:05:37.840> it's<00:05:38.020> gonna

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
not good enough because if it's gonna

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.409 
not good enough because if it's gonna
succeed<00:05:38.610> it's<00:05:39.610> got<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.850> be<00:05:39.910> better<00:05:40.060> than<00:05:40.240> all

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
succeed it's got to be better than all

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.100 
succeed it's got to be better than all
that<00:05:40.630> one<00:05:40.870> too

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
that one too

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.469 
that one too
so<00:05:43.710> how<00:05:43.889> does<00:05:43.949> it<00:05:44.159> get<00:05:44.340> on<00:05:44.580> well<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.210> doesn't

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
so how does it get on well it doesn't

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.600 
so how does it get on well it doesn't
feel<00:05:45.659> quite<00:05:45.990> as<00:05:46.259> solid<00:05:46.470> as<00:05:46.740> now<00:05:46.949> D<00:05:47.009> or<00:05:47.220> a<00:05:47.250> sob

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
feel quite as solid as now D or a sob

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.909 
feel quite as solid as now D or a sob
and<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.569> isn't<00:05:48.810> quite<00:05:49.050> as<00:05:49.319> well<00:05:49.500> made<00:05:49.740> as<00:05:49.889> a

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
and it isn't quite as well made as a

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.369 
and it isn't quite as well made as a
Mercedes<00:05:50.520> but<00:05:50.849> then<00:05:51.000> again<00:05:51.120> what<00:05:51.689> is<00:05:51.900> in

Mercedes but then again what is in

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.920 
Mercedes but then again what is in
addition<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.610> doesn't<00:05:53.909> offer<00:05:54.060> quite<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.719> same

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
addition it doesn't offer quite the same

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.980 
addition it doesn't offer quite the same
perceived<00:05:55.379> value<00:05:55.740> as<00:05:56.039> a<00:05:56.069> voxel<00:05:56.610> or<00:05:56.759> a<00:05:56.849> Ford<00:05:57.150> and

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
fine all-rounder not brilliant in one
