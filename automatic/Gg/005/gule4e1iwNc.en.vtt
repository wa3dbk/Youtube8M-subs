00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.979
 and the other one comes to be the normally 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.920
 closed or the normally open here 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.620
 we see the chopped relay symbol our 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.880
 contacts is the contact 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.150
 normally closed 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.280
 and this one says normally open 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.850
 here we can appreciate it this is the 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.430
 solenoid coil relay what it does 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.119
 is that when it is activated it generates a field 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.850
 magnetic and attracts this metal lever 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.629
 and what it does is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.910
 this would be the common bottom 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.909
 this would be the contact normally 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 closed and the other normally open 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.100
 when exceptional 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 not this lever that drives the contact 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 so that there is continuity towards 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.970
 count because it's normally open and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.320
 they open normally closed this photo 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.360
 of an oak inside 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 that normally come encapsulated from 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.220
 this form 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 and one can appreciate in the figure 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.080
 what are the points of contact both 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.790
 of the solenoid coil as 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 normally closed contacts 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260
 normally open is the box of a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.500
 workbench is that always what 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 it is used for the more 24 volts 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.290
 we can see that they are all 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.450
 gray connections from the top 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.720
 and point of contact to be volts 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.440
 is at the bottom here we can 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 see is the action of some contacts 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.870
 and we can see the ones that are normally 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.970
 open 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.520
 and those that are normally closed if 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.670
 it was activated by this weekly button 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.689
 all these contacts 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.549
 which are normally open and 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.500
 normally closed or if I want 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.240
 I can connect them to trigger them through 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 of a fine electrical point relay 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.119
 manual here we can observe the board 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.230
 of tests and we see how this device 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.500
 It is located at the top 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.740
 and we can take out so much voltage 24 volts 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.530
 with the red wire and the negative part 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.330
 20 volts with the blue wire we reach 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.390
 to see the compressor in some cylinders 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.400
 of double effect and some contacts of 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.799
 knee here we see another board 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.799
 we see a double effect cylinder 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.270
 that when he moves his rod 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.090
 we are making contact in the rollers 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.060
 or some compressor sensors the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 valves 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.620
 and the contacts and power supply 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.200
 another example where you can see the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.380
 double effect cylinders and this one that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.810
 when it reaches sum but the action goes to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.940
 move this contact or relay end of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.860
 career 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.130
 that you can send me the order so that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.960
 trigger another and start another process in 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.880
 this can be appreciated better we have 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.930
 all voltage connection points 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.510
 and the relays the points of the contacts 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.560
 if you want to operate normally we see 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.160
 here the cylinders 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 and here you see the knee contacts 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.170
 when this cylinder is in the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.940
 position to zero 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.420
 you see that this roller is driven 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.300
 when he leaves mid-race and another 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.270
 sensor and at the end you will find the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.400
 end of career we can also 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.110
 appreciate the valves with their solenoids 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.959
 and together connection to make it 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.480
 operate to move the valve in a 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.819
 sense 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.249
 and the air compressor 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.319
 with its meters as a wardrobe 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.900
 writings of the problematic 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.909
 for example when this cylinder and the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.790
 stem go here in the middle triggers 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.489
 this roller relay that what is going to me 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.010
 do is give voltage to this solenoid 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.079
 want to activate any state and I'm going to 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.170
 allow the air to be conducted and 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.719
 activate the next cylinder in turn 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.919
 this one is going to be registered and it's going to activate 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.919
 another function of the process
