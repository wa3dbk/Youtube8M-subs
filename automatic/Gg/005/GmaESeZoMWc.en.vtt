00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.510
 channels to enter 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:58.730
 Well, in general, like this now and the stove 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.640
 as I remember 25. 80 84 with which 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.740
 okay now let's see I don't remember 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.160
 you can remember 4ac beer by yourself 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.700
 see 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.700
 Well, it is necessary to learn a little coma 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.510
 prove these fly off writes down changes 4 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.270
 so right now I'm not 5 1 figure 25 fuck it 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.550
 knows why although I know because you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.490
 taken apart but in short that's just my 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.430
 old finished writing for the second time 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.340
 well i think this is all clear i think 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.710
 even ten minutes did it fine 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.950
 may be 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.490
 Likely today we still on video about 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.330
 has become 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.340
 when I will rest in the size de 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.840
 cassis seems why she does not want anything 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 to be friends with bandikam 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.790
 it surprises me though before 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.980
 perfectly removed the case and of course a couple 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.990
 washes down the news that was planned and 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:00.220
