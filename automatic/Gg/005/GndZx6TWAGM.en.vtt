00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.670
 government that 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.670
 mercenary from the rest 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.079
 toll entrance 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.559
 faster than you miss 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.399
 it becomes the first pole to play second class 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:14.959
 the first chance 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.959
 in this match is for the home team 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.839
 boring first half 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.169
 and none of the government buildings closed 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.630
 round the circle 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.640
 actually i'm about it's a head tail collision 6 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.590
 you don't know what it's like 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.510
 hopefully it comes right to know what degree 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.860
 this is full with its leading role played 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 the part is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 click here to register this walk 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.949
 now there is much too late 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 the first 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.490
 government 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.490
 want to leave the fiat group 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.290
 pot football anticipates the government 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.020
 now it became 0 2 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.420
 that's what the commander has 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 the decision 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 personal life of people 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 of course 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.660
 the wind is 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.970
 who recently stated that it is not full 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 the officer thought I wasn't leaving 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 looks it up too 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.399
 Corendon then did not allow this match to fall behind 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.230
 And of course the Viaduct at Helmond Sport that it's a well-educated people 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.170
 not in the Sickness Benefits Act
