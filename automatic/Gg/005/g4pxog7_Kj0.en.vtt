00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.859
 Galaxy in the queue 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.660
 Lee Sun Kyung 6 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.660
 Let's click on the climbing map icon. 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.720
 On the first screen, it becomes the Korean viscosity. 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.220
 You are up 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.220
 View map 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.560
 I was hoping to set it up on the index now , so I will not see it set as the number. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.550
 If you have followed the settings with the key essential 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.710
 On the mountain 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.670
 If you do not appear in a location, 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.670
 Because 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.400
 This is a little hard to find. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.920
 Once haebolkkayo search Jiri 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.970
 With its own budget 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:33.030
 Gyeongsangbuk-do Chungwangbong 1915m 3m bottle Nam Nam name is selected and structure 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'll go ask you . 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010
 Yes , it's a self show. 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.980
 Now that we have reduced the number of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.980
 What's in the garden? 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.010
 If you look at the bottom now 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 It's an important point. 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.640
 Well again 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:13.130
 The coordinates of the yaw point are now displayed. 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.430
 The place where I point without pointing to the wall now seems to be a crucial point and a fun 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:21.980
 Waiting 17 43 0 5 5 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:26.780
 62 I have been so hard and I've got the value of my comfort ticket. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.510
 And the upper left upper pan 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.120
 This is Morning Edition confinement 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:38.270
 Maybe this compass will move when I go to that location. 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.870
 By the way is now below zero 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:47.390
 The mattress and the yaw portion now marked 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.350
 The shoulder is not that location now, so I do not think the long notation is now . 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.300
 If it's that location, it's 19 million . 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.570
 It appears to be in the form of an orphan. 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.760
 Let's do it again. 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.260
 Oh, I've done a lot of shrinking, but now I 'm just like Jiri 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.990
 It 's like the two of them. 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.990
 It appears in detail with the name. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.520
 I do not know if it's going to happen yet. 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.129
 It has good height gotta breath quite neatly marked and 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.560
 And if 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:39.800
 We lost our way in the mountains. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:44.900
 I am now in the middle of a hiking trail. 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:52.140
 Now if you are in isolation , 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:57.840
 a If we are using gps now, we know about this. 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.870
 In the end it seems that Morning Pohani plays a big role in the compass 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 From its current location 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.500
 I think you can kind of go to the left and right doelneun trail is easy to see in which direction 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.200
 It's a little more glowing and looks more clearly in the oil you need 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.889
 Yes, it is. 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.870
 4 and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.870
 Something close to you is your brother. 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:44.680
 The more you go , the better your mart phone environment 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:46.120
 The current speed is quite fast. It is completely different from the old gps. 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.769
 Lug 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.179
 That's it. 

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.179
 Hwang, Hyeon-hee We are becoming one. 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:00.259
 Now I'll go back again once again back again
