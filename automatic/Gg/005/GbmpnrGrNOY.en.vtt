00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you want to set to 1280 by 720 p again

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.990 
you want to set to 1280 by 720 p again
and<00:03:08.620> tab<00:03:09.620> out<00:03:09.770> of<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.190> now<00:03:10.760> you'll<00:03:10.970> see

area for example and that's all there is

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.410 
area for example and that's all there is
to<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.250> hit<00:03:19.340> apply<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.239> see

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
to it just hit apply and you can see

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.670 
to it just hit apply and you can see

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
that the rest of the a desktop is grayed

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.800 
that the rest of the a desktop is grayed
out<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.160> if<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.000> were<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> export<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:23.600> now

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
out and if you were to export this now

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.479 
out and if you were to export this now
and<00:03:25.630> set<00:03:26.630> scale<00:03:26.870> by<00:03:27.050> 200%<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.310> that

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
and set scale by 200% you can see that

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.110 
and set scale by 200% you can see that
it<00:03:28.550> will<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> 1280<00:03:29.270> by<00:03:29.420> 720<00:03:29.840> p<00:03:30.140> video<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> here

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it will be a 1280 by 720 p video so here

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120 
it will be a 1280 by 720 p video so here
we<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.510> end<00:03:32.810> resulting<00:03:33.590> video<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
we have that end resulting video and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.810 
we have that end resulting video and
just<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.520> confirm<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.209> 1280<00:03:35.630> by<00:03:35.750> 720<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:36.820> if

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
just to confirm it is 1280 by 720 and if

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.590 
just to confirm it is 1280 by 720 and if
you<00:03:37.940> preview<00:03:38.300> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
you preview it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.440 
you preview it
it<00:03:39.380> looks<00:03:39.620> beautifully<00:03:40.010> crystal<00:03:40.580> clear<00:03:40.790> now

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
it looks beautifully crystal clear now

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.030 
it looks beautifully crystal clear now
there<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.930> one<00:03:42.230> thing<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.530> want<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.739> point<00:03:42.890> out

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
there is one thing I want to point out

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.770 
there is one thing I want to point out
if<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.489> take<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> really<00:03:44.239> close<00:03:44.360> look<00:03:44.540> you'll

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
if you take a really close look you'll

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.930 
if you take a really close look you'll
see<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.989> tiny<00:03:45.380> sliver<00:03:45.800> of<00:03:45.920> orange<00:03:46.580> here<00:03:46.790> where

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
see a tiny sliver of orange here where

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.949 
see a tiny sliver of orange here where
the<00:03:47.060> desktop<00:03:47.390> background<00:03:47.540> actually

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
the desktop background actually

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.930 
the desktop background actually
shimmered<00:03:48.440> through<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.950> presume<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:49.730> has<00:03:49.850> to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
shimmered through I presume this has to

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.940 
shimmered through I presume this has to
do<00:03:50.030> with<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.209> fact<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.870> shadow<00:03:51.410> counts

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
do with the fact that the shadow counts

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.009 
do with the fact that the shadow counts
towards<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.550> size<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.420> window<00:03:53.690> when<00:03:53.900> it's

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
towards the size of the window when it's

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.080 
towards the size of the window when it's
resized<00:03:54.380> what<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.550> do<00:03:55.640> here<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.060> can

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
resized what you can do here is you can

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.520 
resized what you can do here is you can
resize<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.690> window<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:57.230> one<00:03:57.380> or<00:03:57.500> two

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
resize the window to just one or two

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.250 
resize the window to just one or two
extra<00:03:57.769> pixels<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.910> just<00:03:59.269> kind<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.540> crop

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
extra pixels and then just kind of crop

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.620 
extra pixels and then just kind of crop
that<00:04:00.470> out<00:04:00.620> when<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:00.980> pick<00:04:01.220> your<00:04:01.250> 1280<00:04:01.850> by<00:04:02.120> 720

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
that out when you pick your 1280 by 720

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.860 
that out when you pick your 1280 by 720
pixel<00:04:03.550> mask<00:04:04.550> later<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.090> that'll<00:04:05.510> help<00:04:05.600> get<00:04:05.750> rid

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
pixel mask later on that'll help get rid

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.020 
pixel mask later on that'll help get rid
of<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.050> one<00:04:06.290> little<00:04:06.410> last<00:04:06.890> remaining<00:04:07.220> shadow

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
of that one little last remaining shadow

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.660 
of that one little last remaining shadow
up<00:04:08.209> top<00:04:08.739> that's<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:09.920> there<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.489> I
