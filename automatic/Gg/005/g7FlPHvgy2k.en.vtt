home<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:29.680> I'm<00:00:30.680> really<00:00:30.860> happy<00:00:31.100> with<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.970> way

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
things are going and hopefully we can

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.910 
things are going and hopefully we can
continue<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.570> winning<00:00:36.110> also<00:00:36.649> in<00:00:36.770> this

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
continue this this winning also in this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.979 
continue this this winning also in this
event<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:37.430> think<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.090> will<00:00:38.300> be<00:00:38.420> quite<00:00:38.780> tricky

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
event I think it will be quite tricky

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.110 
event I think it will be quite tricky
with<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> win<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.800> new<00:00:39.950> car<00:00:40.040> I've<00:00:40.460> never<00:00:40.640> driven<00:00:40.910> a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
with a win a new car I've never driven a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.049 
with a win a new car I've never driven a
group<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.450> car<00:00:41.660> before<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:43.280> it's<00:00:43.640> it's<00:00:43.970> a

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
group and car before and so it's it's a

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.670 
group and car before and so it's it's a
big<00:00:44.210> challenge<00:00:44.390> for<00:00:44.660> me<00:00:44.899> you're<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.410> number

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
big challenge for me you're the number

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.410 
big challenge for me you're the number
one<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.190> line<00:00:46.399> for<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.030> rally<00:00:47.210> of

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
one on the line for the rally of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.200 
one on the line for the rally of
Champions<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.320> think<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.730> benefit

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
Champions you think that is a benefit

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.110 
Champions you think that is a benefit
for<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.600> or<00:00:50.809> maybe<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.230> opposite<00:00:51.620> well<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.489> I

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
for that or maybe the opposite well I I

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.350 
for that or maybe the opposite well I I
think<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:53.780> probably<00:00:54.710> not<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.040> benefit<00:00:55.520> on<00:00:55.550> the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
think it's probably not a benefit on the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.319 
think it's probably not a benefit on the
first<00:00:56.570> day<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:56.950> ok<00:00:57.950> it's<00:00:58.190> just<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.059> way<00:00:59.180> this

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
first day but ok it's just the way this

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.110 
first day but ok it's just the way this
so<00:00:59.540> we<00:00:59.690> have<00:00:59.840> two<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.980> go<00:01:01.219> as<00:01:01.370> quick<00:01:01.550> as<00:01:01.730> we<00:01:01.760> can

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
so we have two to go as quick as we can

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.049 
so we have two to go as quick as we can
even<00:01:02.390> though<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:02.780> are<00:01:02.930> sweeping<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.680> role<00:01:04.059> ok

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059
