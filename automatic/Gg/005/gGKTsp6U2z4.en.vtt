00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
know and sometimes you know not every

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
day is a good strong heavy day so you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.090 
day is a good strong heavy day so you
just<00:02:08.479> kind<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> listen<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.050> your<00:02:09.170> body<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:09.770> once

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
I found out that I wasn't that strong

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.700 
I found out that I wasn't that strong
today<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.690> was<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.990> know<00:02:12.080> what<00:02:12.230> I'm<00:02:12.470> gonna

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
today I was like you know what I'm gonna

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.060 
today I was like you know what I'm gonna
do

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
do

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.950 
do
no<00:02:13.400> wait<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.210> high<00:02:14.420> reps<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
no wait and I'm gonna do high reps so I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.320 
no wait and I'm gonna do high reps so I
rapped<00:02:15.230> out<00:02:15.350> two<00:02:15.620> plates<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.070> 15<00:02:16.520> times<00:02:16.790> and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
rapped out two plates like 15 times and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.520 
rapped out two plates like 15 times and
I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:17.750> why<00:02:17.840> working<00:02:18.020> out<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.410> all

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
I think that's why working out is all

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.080 
I think that's why working out is all
about<00:02:18.830> man<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.220> gotta<00:02:19.370> listen<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.790> your<00:02:19.910> body

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
about man you gotta listen to your body

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.850 
about man you gotta listen to your body
sometimes<00:02:20.600> you're<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.870> strong<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:21.380> fuck<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
sometimes you're just strong as fuck so

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.860 
sometimes you're just strong as fuck so
you<00:02:22.190> put<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.490> some<00:02:22.700> mat<00:02:22.970> weight<00:02:23.240> throw<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> up<00:02:23.750> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you put on some mat weight throw it up a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.240 
you put on some mat weight throw it up a
couple<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.200> times<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:24.620> sometimes<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.160> don't

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
couple of times but sometimes you don't

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.920 
couple of times but sometimes you don't
feel<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.640> strong<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.150> that's<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.720> good<00:02:26.870> time

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
feel that strong and that's a good time

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
feel that strong and that's a good time
to<00:02:27.170> switch<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> go<00:02:28.610> lighter<00:02:29.450> weight

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
to switch it up and go lighter weight

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.750 
to switch it up and go lighter weight
and<00:02:29.960> rep<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.320> out

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and rep it out

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.400 
and rep it out
moving<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.030> deadlifts<00:02:32.660> warming<00:02:33.200> up<00:02:33.320> with

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
moving on to deadlifts warming up with

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.040 
moving on to deadlifts warming up with
some<00:02:33.620> two<00:02:33.830> plates<00:02:34.160> right<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.050> feeling
