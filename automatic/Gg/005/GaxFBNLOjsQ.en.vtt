00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
I mean I got about five hours of sleep

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.639 
I mean I got about five hours of sleep
maybe<00:00:45.430> even<00:00:45.640> slightly<00:00:45.969> less<00:00:46.329> actually<00:00:47.050> clock

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
maybe even slightly less actually clock

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.819 
maybe even slightly less actually clock
but<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:49.629> not<00:00:49.809> tremendously<00:00:50.350> uncommon

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
but which is not tremendously uncommon

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.729 
but which is not tremendously uncommon
for<00:00:50.949> me<00:00:51.070> actually<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:52.719> frequently<00:00:53.410> get

for me actually I very frequently get

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.540 
for me actually I very frequently get
about<00:00:54.399> five<00:00:54.699> maybe<00:00:55.690> six<00:00:55.989> hours<00:00:56.379> that's<00:00:57.280> pretty

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
about five maybe six hours that's pretty

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.259 
about five maybe six hours that's pretty
normal<00:00:59.100> but<00:01:01.140> yeah<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.320> was<00:01:03.039> up<00:01:03.280> six<00:01:03.940> little

the<00:01:58.100> forums<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.659> my<00:01:59.659> initial<00:02:00.049> taste<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the forums that my initial taste to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.359 
the forums that my initial taste to
experience<00:02:02.800> might<00:02:03.800> have<00:02:03.890> been<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
experience might have been the

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.190 
experience might have been the
grittiness<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.330> noticed<00:02:05.720> might<00:02:05.930> have<00:02:06.050> been

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
grittiness I noticed might have been

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.020 
grittiness I noticed might have been
really<00:02:06.650> kind<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.950> amplified<00:02:07.520> by<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.820> fact

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
really kind of amplified by the fact

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.510 
really kind of amplified by the fact
that<00:02:08.060> i'm<00:02:08.209> using<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.509> straw<00:02:08.750> i<00:02:09.050> had<00:02:09.800> considered

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
that i'm using a straw i had considered

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
that i'm using a straw i had considered
that<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.000> generally<00:02:11.989> like<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.260> drink

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that and I generally like to drink

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.820 
that and I generally like to drink
thicker<00:02:12.980> things<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> straw<00:02:14.350> not<00:02:15.350> such<00:02:15.800> a

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
thicker things with a straw not such a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.770 
thicker things with a straw not such a
fan<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.430> drinking<00:02:16.730> them<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.180> glass

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
fan of just drinking them out of a glass

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.740 
fan of just drinking them out of a glass
or<00:02:18.080> whatever<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.120> thought<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.450> would<00:02:20.630> try

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
or whatever but I thought I would try

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.330 
or whatever but I thought I would try
that<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.470> why<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.650> morning<00:02:21.890> i'm<00:02:22.160> just

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
that so that's why this morning i'm just

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880 
that so that's why this morning i'm just

trying to drink a milkshake out of a
glass<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.410> which<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.709> be<00:02:36.800> kind<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> hard<00:02:37.250> they

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
glass and which can be kind of hard they

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.270 
glass and which can be kind of hard they
don't<00:02:37.910> pour<00:02:38.180> well<00:02:38.480> they're<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.350> thick<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.010> so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
don't pour well they're so thick so so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.650 
don't pour well they're so thick so so
on<00:02:40.370> let's<00:02:40.519> not<00:02:40.640> like<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.090> pretty<00:02:41.420> darn

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
on let's not like that is pretty darn

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.570 
on let's not like that is pretty darn
thin<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:41.989> mean<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.290> mostly<00:02:42.530> water<00:02:42.800> right<00:02:43.100> it's

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
thin I mean it's mostly water right it's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.970 
thin I mean it's mostly water right it's
a<00:02:43.700> very<00:02:44.110> very<00:02:45.110> liquidy<00:02:45.940> very<00:02:46.940> liquidy<00:02:47.300> liquid

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
a very very liquidy very liquidy liquid

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.390 
a very very liquidy very liquidy liquid
but<00:02:50.019> yeah<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.470> working<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:51.890> me<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.130> drink<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
but yeah it's working for me to drink it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.979 
but yeah it's working for me to drink it
out<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.610> glass<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:53.300> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.569> leaving<00:02:53.930> a

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
out of a glass it's kind of leaving a

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.280 
out of a glass it's kind of leaving a
lot<00:02:54.200> behind<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.700> glass<00:02:56.000> itself

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
lot behind on the on the glass itself

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.350 
lot behind on the on the glass itself
there's<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.380> fair<00:02:57.590> amount<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.860> grit<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:59.269> know

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
there's a fair amount of grit you know

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.569 
there's a fair amount of grit you know
you<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.630> kind<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.870> see<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:01.310> powder

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
you can kind of see a little powder

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.350 
you can kind of see a little powder
stuff<00:03:01.970> left<00:03:02.239> behind<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:04.000> probably<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.180> big

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
stuff left behind so probably not a big

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.960 
stuff left behind so probably not a big
deal<00:03:05.510> hopefully<00:03:06.320> I'm<00:03:06.410> not<00:03:06.530> losing<00:03:07.400> out<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
deal hopefully I'm not losing out in the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.940 
deal hopefully I'm not losing out in the
nutrients<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.750> way<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.200> think<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:09.769> unlikely

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
nutrients that way I think it's unlikely

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.690 
nutrients that way I think it's unlikely
because<00:03:11.049> most<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.530> suspect<00:03:13.130> based<00:03:13.400> on

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
because most like the I suspect based on

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.720 
because most like the I suspect based on
what<00:03:14.390> I've<00:03:14.510> noticed<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:14.959> far<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:16.220> I'm<00:03:16.519> going

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
what I've noticed so far that I'm going

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.900 
what I've noticed so far that I'm going
to<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:17.510> requiring<00:03:17.930> fewer<00:03:18.260> calories<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.980> fewer

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to be requiring fewer calories a fewer

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.970 
to be requiring fewer calories a fewer
silent<00:03:20.390> calories<00:03:20.780> than<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.260> do<00:03:21.320> with<00:03:21.680> solid

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
silent calories than I do with solid

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.470 
silent calories than I do with solid
food<00:03:22.130> anyway<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.820> have<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> hunch<00:03:23.329> that

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
food anyway I just have a hunch that

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.479 
food anyway I just have a hunch that
that's<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.019> way<00:03:24.110> it's<00:03:24.230> gonna<00:03:24.350> play<00:03:24.470> out<00:03:24.560> so

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
that's the way it's gonna play out so

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.550 
that's the way it's gonna play out so
even<00:03:25.880> if<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.030> lose<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.930> know<00:03:27.019> few<00:03:27.350> calories

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
even if I lose you know few calories

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.710 
even if I lose you know few calories
here<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.010> there<00:03:28.130> because<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.880> probably

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
here and there because of that probably

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.380 
here and there because of that probably
not<00:03:29.840> gonna<00:03:29.989> be<00:03:30.079> an<00:03:30.170> issue<00:03:31.090> anyway<00:03:32.590> day<00:03:34.390> one

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
not gonna be an issue anyway day one

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.780 
not gonna be an issue anyway day one
sort<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.200> day<00:03:36.530> two<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:37.040> don't<00:03:37.220> know<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.609> really

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
sort of day two I don't know this really

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.979 
sort of day two I don't know this really
constitutes<00:03:38.239> day<00:03:38.329> one<00:03:38.510> or<00:03:38.630> day<00:03:38.660> two<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:38.900> guess

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
constitutes day one or day two I guess

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.479 
constitutes day one or day two I guess
it<00:03:39.200> has<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.320> be<00:03:39.470> day<00:03:39.620> two<00:03:39.680> because<00:03:40.040> yesterday<00:03:40.459> I

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
it has to be day two because yesterday I

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.660 
it has to be day two because yesterday I
went<00:03:40.700> mostly<00:03:40.880> Isola<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.709> day<00:03:42.709> 20<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.160> silent

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
went mostly Isola so day 20 on silent

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.690 
went mostly Isola so day 20 on silent
very<00:03:44.420> cool
