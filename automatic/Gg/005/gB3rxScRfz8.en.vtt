 The value of the property is a number in units such as pixels or points 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:35.650
 Contains a relative value that can be specified using a percentage or a keyword 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.819
 In this state, the style sheet and html file are not linked yet 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.519

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:53.350
 Note written in between notes does not affect the description of css, so it is a memorandum 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.350
 It is a good idea to write, etc. 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.330
 Try changing the font color To specify the font color in the style sheet 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.320
 use the color property 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.700
 Use color games and hexadecimal numbers for the specified method 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.700

 For the und element 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.819
 The color of the letters is here 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.819
 I tried to specify

 The name is a method of specifying the color name 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:06.099
 For typical colors, for example red or yellow white pink 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.099
 You can specify the color using the color name and so on 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.960
 Save the document and check the display 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.460
 Because I specified the color of the text for the body 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.470
 Content in the body is all red color of the text 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.060
 next 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.060
 It is a way to be in the bar code 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:52.880
 The three primary colors of red, green, and blue are the weakest colors from 00 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.880
 It can be specified using hexadecimal numbers up to ff 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:59.899
 This ff is arranged in rgb from 00 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.280
 Describe with # at the beginning 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:11.610
 For example, if you are a blue person 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.610
 0000 ff 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:19.450
 Save by overwrite and check the display 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.450
 The first element turns blue 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.269
 These six numbers are 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.330
 rr 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.330
 gg 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:39.330
 means bb 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.330
 It corresponds to the color of r of red g of green b of blue 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.169
 If the martyr of red ff 0000 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.030
 If you are a green officer 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.810
 Because the green becomes stronger 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:57.190
 Red is 0 and green is 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.190
 Strongest ff 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.919
 Blue is the weakest 00 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.919
 This will be the middle occupation 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.810
 In photoshop color pickers etc 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.490
 Of the color chosen 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:26.500
 It is very convenient because it displays hexadecimal numbers 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.500
