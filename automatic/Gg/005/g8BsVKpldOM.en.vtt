00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
the old ax gesture like so using a

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.050 
the old ax gesture like so using a
magnet<00:01:22.469> or<00:01:23.240> tweezers<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:25.460> little<00:01:26.460> tension<00:01:26.850> on

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
magnet or tweezers a little tension on

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.879 
magnet or tweezers a little tension on
the<00:01:27.119> cable<00:01:27.329> and<00:01:27.869> we'll<00:01:28.200> try<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> rod

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
the cable and we'll try and get the rod

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.340 
the cable and we'll try and get the rod
out<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:32.759> wasn't<00:01:32.969> with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> magnet<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
out this wasn't with the magnet so it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.779 
out this wasn't with the magnet so it
most<00:01:34.530> likely<00:01:34.829> has<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> mushroom<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:40.789> typically

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
most likely has a mushroom and typically

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.219 
most likely has a mushroom and typically
that<00:01:41.999> should<00:01:42.149> be<00:01:42.240> free<00:01:42.479> enough<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> moves

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that should be free enough that it moves

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
that should be free enough that it moves
with<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.859> magnet<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> doesn't<00:01:44.729> that's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
with just a magnet if it doesn't that's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.879 
with just a magnet if it doesn't that's
showing<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.179> how<00:01:45.329> bad<00:01:45.539> in<00:01:46.499> there<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> can

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
showing you how bad in there you can

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:52.160 
showing you how bad in there you can
actually<00:01:46.979> hear<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.279> scraping<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
actually hear it scraping and you can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.709 
actually hear it scraping and you can
see<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.409> end<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:52.950> alright<00:01:53.659> once<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
see the end right there alright once you

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.599 
see the end right there alright once you
get<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> rod<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> liberal<00:01:56.340> amount<00:01:56.490> of

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
get the rod in put a liberal amount of

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.279 
get the rod in put a liberal amount of
grease<00:01:56.789> on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.539> end<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:57.869> bolt<00:01:58.829> here<00:02:00.289> we're

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
grease on the end of the bolt here we're

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.859 
grease on the end of the bolt here we're
just<00:02:01.409> gonna<00:02:01.529> hold<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.420> ball<00:02:03.420> bearing<00:02:03.749> in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
just gonna hold this ball bearing in

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.889 
just gonna hold this ball bearing in
place

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
place

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.749 
place
like<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.439> now<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
like so now you don't have to get this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.100 
like so now you don't have to get this
past<00:02:12.410> versatile<00:02:13.410> opening<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.720> center

in<00:02:52.890> until<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.220> fill<00:02:53.400> resistance<00:02:53.849> once<00:02:54.180> you

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
in until we fill resistance once you

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.089 
in until we fill resistance once you
feel<00:02:54.450> resistance<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.829> go<00:02:55.890> ahead<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
feel resistance you want to go ahead and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.819 
feel resistance you want to go ahead and
back<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.489> out<00:02:56.610> an<00:02:57.090> eighth<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.660> turn<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.739> I'm

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
back it out an eighth of a turn so I'm

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.800 
back it out an eighth of a turn so I'm
just<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.160> go<00:02:59.220> ahead<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.540> screw<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.569> in

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
just going to go ahead and screw this in

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:13.000 
just going to go ahead and screw this in
till<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> feel<00:03:01.110> resistance

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.990 

right<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.670> back<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.630> an<00:03:15.780> eight

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
right there and back it up an eight

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.370 
right there and back it up an eight
now<00:03:18.000> you're<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.330> lock<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.200> best

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
now you're going to lock it in the best

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.830 
now you're going to lock it in the best
way<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.950> should<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.840> run

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
way to do that is I should have a run

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.880 
way to do that is I should have a run
through<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.050> whole<00:03:22.200> way<00:03:22.410> through<00:03:22.650> it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
through the whole way through it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.410 
through the whole way through it
but<00:03:23.340> since<00:03:23.490> I<00:03:23.580> don't<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.270> go

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
but since I don't I'm just going to go

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.110 
but since I don't I'm just going to go
ahead<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.840> give<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> little<00:03:26.010> extra<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.060> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
ahead and give it a little extra so I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.710 
ahead and give it a little extra so I
have<00:03:27.270> room<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.780> tighten<00:03:28.080> up

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.050 

don't<00:03:37.350> just<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.590> ahead<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.980> got<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.310> nut<00:03:38.490> there
