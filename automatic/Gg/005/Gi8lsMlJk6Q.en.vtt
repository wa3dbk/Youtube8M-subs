hey guys it's mr. herp steer and today's

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.759 
hey guys it's mr. herp steer and today's
focus<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.660> gonna<00:00:12.750> be<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:12.990> incomplete

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
focus is gonna be on incomplete

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.310 
focus is gonna be on incomplete
dominance<00:00:14.389> codominance<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.599> multiple

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320

wheels<00:00:16.740> now<00:00:17.250> before<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.699> into<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.090> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
wheels now before we get into all that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
wheels now before we get into all that
let's<00:00:18.480> make<00:00:18.600> sure<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:19.170> comfortable<00:00:19.439> with

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
let's make sure we're comfortable with

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.470 
let's make sure we're comfortable with
this<00:00:20.070> idea<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.520> being<00:00:20.789> dominant<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.449> recessive

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
this idea of being dominant or recessive

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.679 
this idea of being dominant or recessive
but<00:00:22.439> basically<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.279> something<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.600> an

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
but basically if something if an if an

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.359 
but basically if something if an if an
allele<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.900> dominant<00:00:25.109> has<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> ability<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
allele is dominant has the ability to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.480 
allele is dominant has the ability to
mask<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.330> cap<00:00:27.660> off<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.380> cover<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
mask or like cap off or cover up the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
mask or like cap off or cover up the
other<00:00:29.730> allele<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.330> showing<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.140> biology

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
other allele from showing up in biology

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
other allele from showing up in biology
a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> times<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.090> flowers<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
a lot of times we like to use flowers so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
a lot of times we like to use flowers so
for<00:00:34.320> example<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.340> purple<00:00:35.850> flowers

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
for example we can have purple flowers

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.479 
for example we can have purple flowers
we're<00:00:36.660> gonna<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.930> white<00:00:37.140> flowers<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.920> then

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we're gonna have white flowers and then

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
we're gonna have white flowers and then
also<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.690> gonna<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.930> purple<00:00:40.320> flowers

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
also we're gonna have purple flowers

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.209 
also we're gonna have purple flowers
well<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.969> flower<00:00:42.270> right<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.230> big<00:00:43.920> P

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
well this flower right here is big P

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.119 
well this flower right here is big P
little<00:00:44.550> P<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.210> he's<00:00:45.420> what's<00:00:45.629> called<00:00:45.719> being

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
little P so he's what's called being

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.240 
little P so he's what's called being
heterozygote<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:48.140> flower<00:00:49.140> color<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
heterozygote for flower color but if you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
heterozygote for flower color but if you
take<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.579> he<00:00:50.789> ends<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.390> being<00:00:51.600> purple<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
take a look he ends up being purple this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
take a look he ends up being purple this
flower<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> big<00:00:54.030> P<00:00:54.239> big<00:00:54.270> P<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
flower here is big P big P and it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
flower here is big P big P and it's
purple<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.590> flower<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.699> P

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
purple this flower here is a little P

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
purple this flower here is a little P
little<00:00:57.000> P<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> white<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> one

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
little P and it's white but this one

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
little P and it's white but this one
here<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> each<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.780> still

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
here is one of each and it's still

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
here is one of each and it's still
purple<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.730> sure<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> big

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
purple so we know for sure that that big

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
purple so we know for sure that that big
P<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.379> has<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> ability<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> mask

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
P right there has the ability to mask

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.149 
P right there has the ability to mask
that<00:01:05.909> little<00:01:06.540> P<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.590> end<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.890> seeing

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that little P so we don't end up seeing

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.940 
that little P so we don't end up seeing
any<00:01:08.340> white<00:01:08.840> however<00:01:09.840> sometimes<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
any white however sometimes we get this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410 
any white however sometimes we get this
weird<00:01:11.220> concept<00:01:11.549> called<00:01:12.000> incomplete

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
weird concept called incomplete

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420 
weird concept called incomplete
dominance<00:01:12.930> where<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.740> end<00:01:14.310> up

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dominance where actually we end up

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
dominance where actually we end up
seeing<00:01:14.640> both<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> those<00:01:15.659> traits<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> same

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
seeing both of those traits at the same

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.820 
seeing both of those traits at the same
time<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.409> third

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
time so it's where we get this third

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
time so it's where we get this third
phenotype<00:01:20.640> where<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.030> sort<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> mix<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
phenotype where it's sort of a mix of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.969 
phenotype where it's sort of a mix of
the<00:01:22.560> other<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:23.390> phenotypes<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:25.470> example<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the other two phenotypes for example we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
the other two phenotypes for example we
can<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.130> red<00:01:26.400> flowers<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.060> big<00:01:27.450> R<00:01:27.659> big<00:01:27.840> R

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
can have red flowers right big R big R

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
can have red flowers right big R big R
we're<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.799> white<00:01:29.130> flowers<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.700> are

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
we're gonna have white flowers which are

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
we're gonna have white flowers which are
little<00:01:30.119> R<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.299> R<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.079> sometimes<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:32.280> can

little R little R but sometimes they can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
little R little R but sometimes they can
mix<00:01:32.670> together<00:01:33.030> where<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.960> each

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
mix together where we have one of each

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.249 
mix together where we have one of each
and<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.860> end<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.250> being<00:01:35.310> pink<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.840> find<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and they end up being pink to find out a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.950 
and they end up being pink to find out a
little<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:38.150> about<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.390> phenomenon

another phenomena we find in biology is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.859 
another phenomena we find in biology is
this<00:01:57.840> idea<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> codons<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
this idea of codons where actually we

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
this idea of codons where actually we
have<00:02:01.079> both<00:02:01.530> alleles<00:02:02.040> sort<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.670> show<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
have both alleles sort of show up at the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.389 
have both alleles sort of show up at the
same<00:02:03.540> time<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.590> good<00:02:04.740> example<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
same time a really good example of that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.789 
same time a really good example of that
is<00:02:05.700> sickle-cell<00:02:06.360> anemia<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.380> humans

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is sickle-cell anemia and humans

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.510 
is sickle-cell anemia and humans
sickle-cell<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> disease<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:10.190> human<00:02:11.190> blood

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
sickle-cell is a disease in human blood

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.710 
sickle-cell is a disease in human blood
that<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.780> haven't<00:02:13.260> people

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
that actually if you haven't people

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.710 
that actually if you haven't people
with<00:02:14.110> sickle<00:02:14.650> cell<00:02:14.680> won't<00:02:15.100> survive<00:02:15.720> into

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
with sickle cell won't survive into

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.120 
with sickle cell won't survive into
adulthood<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:19.690> have<00:02:20.020> normal<00:02:20.650> blood<00:02:20.740> cells

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
adulthood but we have normal blood cells

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.310 
adulthood but we have normal blood cells
and<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.550> can<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:21.910> sickle<00:02:22.330> cell<00:02:22.480> blood<00:02:23.020> cells

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
and we can have sickle cell blood cells

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.900 
and we can have sickle cell blood cells
these<00:02:23.560> ones<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.040> are<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.280> ones<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.700> make

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
these ones here are the ones that make

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.900 
these ones here are the ones that make
people<00:02:25.300> really<00:02:25.570> sick<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.380> then<00:02:26.980> sometimes<00:02:27.610> we

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
people really sick and then sometimes we

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.110 
people really sick and then sometimes we
can<00:02:28.090> actually<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.750> what's<00:02:29.440> called

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
can actually have what's called

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
can actually have what's called
codominance<00:02:31.120> where<00:02:31.360> some<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.140> them<00:02:32.380> are

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
codominance where some of them are

sickle cell and some of the cell blood
cells<00:02:35.020> are<00:02:35.170> normal<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.490> if<00:02:36.640> both<00:02:36.910> of
