00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.109
 Tournai oh 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.730
 Come on, this is not even true 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.560
 and then 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560
 mono 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.980
 so 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.670
 I think they are positive 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.950
 especially if she said she herself 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.309
 distant land to see them so I wish 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.750
 also super questions to remember 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.750
 how bucketed a tall men 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.450
 i don't know exactly how the i met 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.940
 is going to be because of course all that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:02.080
 years ago that I am a small child 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.080
 80 years later mature man 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 So I really do not know 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 she will be very happy together 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.580
 but also very sad 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.960
 No 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.050
 you can search 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:16.460
 the sheet you can know about me 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.880
 boy would never see that was very 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.000
 warm and a hug 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.970
 felt that that is your men is one 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.970
 gift that someone so long 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.590

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.620
 wise of them 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.849

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.849
