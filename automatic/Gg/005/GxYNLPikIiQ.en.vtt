00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.420
 good tonight not just received 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.530
 one more toy bought in the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.639
 england is the kit kraft boy to 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.639
 placement of each island 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.180
 I tried to buy here in Brazil, it was not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.720
 It's possible in one place , I have not finished it. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.449
 buying the amazon in arrived today 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.350
 lived exactly nine days from the acquisition 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.840
 until today 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.660
 I really liked it very quickly what it is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 composed of two pieces one only one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.350
 and the other is effectively where the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.350
 people make the holes 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.710
 it's already holes in millimeters for 8-10 and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 6 millimeters 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.530
 I'm going to take a test, I've already done it. 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.620
 do the other now with with video already 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.120
 regulates drills in depths 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 right are not 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.210
 both one another as though there 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.680
 it is worth highlighting another acquisition 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 excellent these walker cup machines 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.760
 that comes out pretty simple 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 in this case I'm going to put the families 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.320
 in this sense 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.990
 fix the inner part 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.329
 The next piece is where the 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:41.429
 not fixed if it is on the other side 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.610
 put the distance here on the other hand 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.860
 from the side 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.039
 it is interesting the first agent to fix 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.899
 the face of the wood with the face of the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:02:07.310
 death can fix the wood of 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:07.310
 top of the other side of the other side 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.360
 to iacc as the 8 hole 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.709
 He 's deep inside, I'm going to let go. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.709
 and drag a little there 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 fixed again 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:42.030
 just stick 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:43.849
 first I'll stick the top piece in the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.450
 sequence 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.450
 the other piece 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.950
 I know these two that changes this party 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.180
 more towards the center 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.540
 in case I'm going to put your two 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.280
 families here I'll fix it again 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.870
 as the pieces are small 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.989
 You do not have to give a little more 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:27.480
 Work took death from here. 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:30.569
 I put the fixed one on the other side again and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:41.180
 drag this give and which will 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:50.330
 effectively stay the future all fixed 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.330
 pure and bored from below 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:17.910
 're ready just take the two holes and 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.560
 other two holes 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.560
 We are going to hit the beam. 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:05:15.520
 which comes with 40 dowels of 40 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:05:22.660
 Really seamless millimeter 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.660
 we have no side with a defect
