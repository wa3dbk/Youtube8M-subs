00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 How long have you updated your video card 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.940
 be guided only by the price or want 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 choose the best based on budget cares 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.719
 do you have a bit bus core frequency or 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.330
 just choose the one in which more 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 Memory Edition x games game for you 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.570
 will tell you about some secrets 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.420
 shopping that will help you choose 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.420
 the best video card for your budget let's start 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.380
 the first thing to pay attention 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.520
 series name and number 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.220
 for example radeon r9 290x or jeep for 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.050
 gtx780 ti oh when the number of fps in 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.329
 games the main criterion when choosing worth 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.920
 first look at your wallet then 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.290
 the choice of video cards in the store in which 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.830
 you get and again in your wallet 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.370
 for example, gtx780 ti is on the counter and 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.470
 gtx 960 small remake is not worth 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 come to the store and immediately buy 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.210
 sales assistants are scary people and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.970
 can easily slip a useless gtx 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.549
 750 which is no good and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.619
 do not have time to blink so go 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.450
 in the store we remember what we are looking for 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.460
 online comparisons and even then with 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.590
 peace of mind go to the store again 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.790
 practice shows that new is not always 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.710
 the most powerful 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.990
 so the best choice between these two 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.820
 780 ti video cards 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.000
 which gives out almost a half times 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.909
 more fps than 960 although cunning sellers 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.860
 will argue the opposite also even 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.630
 if the budget is not limited anyway 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.820
 worth spending on a video card more 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.829
 than 300 bucks but it will not give so much 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.710
 frames it is not worth it yes and with such 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.420
 deal is easier to buy ps4 result 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.189
 choose top or grave top 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.820
 cards of the series that you can 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.219
 allow 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.219
 and even easier to steam on the Internet 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.500
 Now, but the memory number of gigabytes is not 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.960
 as important as a tire 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.940
 This is one of the most popular errors when 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.590
 choosing to choose the card in which 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.330
 more memory not paying attention to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 the remaining parameters are how to build 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.160
 skyscraper in the village what's the difference 2 or 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.679
 4 gigabytes will be if the bus all this power 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 not in order to assess the graphics card does not become 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.330
 bottle neck for the whole system 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.250
 It is worth choosing a card with at least 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.090
 128 killed but this is the least on 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.610
 present day 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 aim for 256 and you will 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 happiness graphics it offers refreshing 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.890
 larger tire size 384 or even hellish 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.959
 512 cards of this video is less 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.670
 power more reliability promptly 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.600
 produced driver and intelligent 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.550
 support let's go over the little things 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.459
 gddr5 works twice as good as ddr3 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 in any case it is a fact if the choice is worth 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.860
 between one gddr5 gigabyte four 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 gigabytes ddr3 then gddr5 will be the best 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 by choice 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 The same situation is with slots 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.970
 write express so we will not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.190
 go deeper move on if you 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.080
 there is an ancient tseleron pentium sempron 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.310
 or atlanta should not even look at 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.680
 top video cards 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.320
 notice the midrange solution from 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.030
 gigabit asus and other due to the fact that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.860
 the processor will be for top video cards 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.430
 bottleneck difference between 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.320
 tayton x and gtx670 you will not notice but here 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 wallet will thank you as well to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.799
 the money saved nowadays is worth 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.799
 think though both 4 cores 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.180
 now the least important right away 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.670
 decide that you need more silence 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.740
 and rest or roaring powerful card with 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.600
 three huge fans if 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.640
 first then passive cooling then 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.590
 there are radiators that will definitely suit you 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.530
 if speed is above all for you 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.720
 then active cooling is your choice there and 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.460
 combined solutions like 3 coolers 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.140
 plus heat pipes in all directions 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.690
 but they are made only for the hottest 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.730
 chips probably you heard such words 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.290
 as with alla crossfire this technology 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.510
 which allows you to work two 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.150
 cards at the same time and more 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.570
 for example 4 for this winn video there is 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.150
 Kuat by force md crossfire x but it's fun 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.130
 for the richest and vigorous and nvidia 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.110
 crossfire wonder gain 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.210
 performance as much as two times possible 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.340
 think in words it all sounds 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.860
 it is tempting and on tests it turns out completely 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.230
 not that second card doubles 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.810
 power is likely to gain 25 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.340
 50 percent plus n video for correct 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.590
 work needs not only boards with two 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.200
 connectors but also two identical video cards 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.820
 MTS does not need to use this 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.250
 specialized multi- except smart 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.919
 the bridge of the type and nvidia bran with alle 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.840
 or the forms and power of the video card are connected 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.580
 successively simple crossfire x 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.590
 bridges yes and only need 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.290
 the same series of video cards is possible even with 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.330
 different frequencies based on this conclusion 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.520
 such if you play 4-ke 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.050
 display with all settings to maximum 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.680
 then this is a sensible decision 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.750
 and if on monitor 1920 to 1080 then I 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.520
 one modern card handle it 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.440
 otherwise it is worth picking up 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.180
 the right motherboard and stock up on the block 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.180
 supply at least 750 watts 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.950
 bought a card unpack try 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.560
 insert it does not fit 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.020
 great choice can carry it back 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.040
 continue to remember the size of the body and what 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.620
 there can climb 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.960
 bought a card inserted and the computer became 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.550
 constantly reboot great 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.920
 now take care of the powerful blocks 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.990
 power in general and power supply can 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.940
 in more detail since it is almost the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.710
 important thing in the whole computer even 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.590
 the name hints what to choose 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.520
 this unit is very serious 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.370
 minimal set for modern 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.680
 550 watt systems per unit from Chinese 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.450
 manufacturers don't even look one of 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.150
 best quality make a corsair or 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.040
 zalman on these blocks, they can rely on 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.260
 honestly work out every investment in 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.300
 them a penny about them is also worth paying 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.390
 attention at the very beginning to look 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.070
 what kind of power for coolers need cards 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.410
 usually these sixteen connectors happen and 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.300
 more and sometimes even without these 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.420
 connectors for example when cooler and directly 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.680
 powered by asus gt440 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.680
 or even with passive cooling 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.970
 summarize look look at food 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.640
 We look at the tests and the question for the audience and 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.070
 how do you choose a graphics card and which one 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.380
 chip maker prefer answers 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.390
