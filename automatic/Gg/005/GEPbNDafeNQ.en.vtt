00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.950
 trials fusion 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.230
 already the fifth game in the line 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.940
 travels if someone does not know the first part 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.539
 It was released in 2000 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.250
 the last in 2012 royals is an arcade 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.140
 platform races where players 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.510
 invited to pass all sorts of wild 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 motorcycle riding routes at all if 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.359
 to be exact it's not even racing it's hell 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.849
 purgatory real torture for 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.370
 perfectionist thrice game series 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.200
 famous for its breathtaking 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.960
 complexity this is the case when 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.390
 you can fail time to restart 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.590
 same track because somewhere 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.510
 something is not calculated 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.280
 and crashed at first you will just 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.010
 get annoyed then swear 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.620
 bad words then natural 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.750
 damn those who came up with it exactly 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 as long as you fail 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.699
 you conceived then bliss comes 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.640
 and after him the desire to try 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.160
 another route but no one promises that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.980
 all this will not happen again in general 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.840
 gorgeous thing trials fusion transfers 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.580
 series action in future track 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.590
 laid right in the middle shining 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 futuristic megacities on some 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.810
 alien resort sterile factories 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.830
 Shah, then where are they not? 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 motorcycle and look quite 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.930
 in modern it is all the same screeching 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.790
 getting the bike back and forth 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.860
 roll over the front wheel 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.900
 each of the motorcycles available in the game 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.479
 behaves in its own way one quickly 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.439
 accelerates and easily falls another well 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.479
 keeps balance 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.390
 third generally suitable for all sorts of tricks 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.920
 and so on, and there is a quad bike 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 the truth can be used far from 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.579
 all levels 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.380
 the mechanics of the game are just like cobble 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.360
 gently accelerate and jump with 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.369
 one platform to another while trying 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.810
 this keep his balance dismiss 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.090
 left stick to center of gravity 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.460
 shifted forward reject left 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.049
 move back fell be kind 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.360
 back to last checkpoint 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.590
 or restart the track somewhere in the corner 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.259
 there is a timer that counts down 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.030
 time spent by you will pass the route to 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.289
 deadline without a single fall 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.110
 get three medals 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.840
 if you fall a couple of times, get 2 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.360
 go really bad get one or 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 nothing at all here is sleep itself saying everything 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.560
 the basics 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.720
 at first the game seems 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.099
 very simple first levels pass 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 deceptively easy 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.810
 further it gets harder you learn 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.580
 about the fact that here you can jump 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.190
 the air afterwards about the tricks 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.959
 tricks is a novelty of the series being in 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.730
 flying correctly rotating stick 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.800
 you can force your motorcyclist 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
 kamikaze hold all sorts of insane 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.390
 positions on bike 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.030
 the levels are dedicated to it all here 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 probably lies the biggest trouble Troilus 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 Stranger all these frills looks very 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.790
 spectacularly but most often so unhappy 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.330
 rider does not at all what you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.430
 wanted to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.769
 sometimes you are required to perform specific 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.380
 tricks but whatever you do play them 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.900
 just doesn't register anyway 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.239
 This innovation is only a small part of the royal 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 fusion is mainly a game dedicated to jumping 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.769
 from platform to platform in this she 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.390
 shows itself superbly overwhelming 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.459
 Most of the tracks are created with large 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.950
 attention to the guitar and calculated to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.989
 centimeter developers throttling know 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.569
 how to make the player focus and 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.090
 think of nothing but your bike and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.820
 springboard game 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.410
 tightens like an industrial vacuum cleaner 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.079
 forcing to pass already familiar tracks 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.790
 again and again in trying to improve your 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.070
 result for fans to try on 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.959
 success with others here there is an online 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.790
 leaderboard and local availability 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.440
 co-op but the online multiplayer 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 from the game gone and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.560
 it's sad if you're happy loner 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.690
 without friends 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.790
 all you have to do is look at your 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.670
 nickname among thousands of unknown people from 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.440
 Internet sadness-longing but you do not care 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.930
 can customize the look of your 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.090
 bike and buy new suits for his 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.769
 driver the farther you move along 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.299
 virtual career ladder 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.790
 more new tracks open to you 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.549
 gradually fast rides from 100 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.359
 meter jumps are replaced by slow 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.850
 and very very very difficult jumps with 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.400
 one ledge to another is in its own way 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.650
 interesting but closer to the end of the game fun 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.540
 still a bit lacking though always 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.370
 can return to the previous level and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.979
 try to perform certain 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.560
 Challenge three pieces on each of the times 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.840
 with replayability lost fusion all in 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.270
 order in the new part appeared some 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.039
 some kind of artificial plot 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.870
 intelligence in a female voice comments 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.520
 all happening and a second voice 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.340
 owned by an unknown man 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.130
 makes all sorts of ads very 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.010
 often they try to joke it would be 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.349
 even funny if not one but each 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.370
 replica tightly tied to specific 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.470
 points on the track 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.840
 if you restart the race a 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.630
 do it will repeatedly replica 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.060
 will sound again in the end a hundred times 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.610
 You will listen to the same thing a thousand 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.630
 times a million times happiness all dialogue 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.060
 can be disabled 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.159
 but then nothing about what's happening you 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.440
 find out and that part of the royals give 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.630
 fans of the series are exactly what they need 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.960
 dozens of brand new perfect 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.820
 verified tracks and already tos game 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.380
 need the game is still present 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.960
 editor thanks to which number 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.280
 levels will only increase 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.770
 despite some blokes travels dinner 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.500
 a game where you can come back again and 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.510
 again and this is for her the most important thing on 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.289
 that's all good luck and see you on 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.289
