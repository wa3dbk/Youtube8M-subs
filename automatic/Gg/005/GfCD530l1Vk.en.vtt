millimeter<00:00:11.160> nib<00:00:11.420> probably<00:00:12.420> largest<00:00:12.780> nib<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
millimeter nib probably largest nib I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.609 
millimeter nib probably largest nib I
would<00:00:13.259> use<00:00:13.670> for<00:00:14.670> any<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> universal

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
would use for any like for a universal

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.010 
would use for any like for a universal
tag<00:00:16.830> maybe<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.640> your<00:00:17.760> tag<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.690> worked<00:00:18.869> with

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
tag maybe if your tag really worked with

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.740 
tag maybe if your tag really worked with
a<00:00:19.109> larger<00:00:19.410> net<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.949> looked<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.750> then

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
a larger net like it looked good then

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.870 
a larger net like it looked good then
you<00:00:21.900> could<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.529> I'd<00:00:23.010> say<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you could do it but I'd say this the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.230 
you could do it but I'd say this the
largest<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:25.789> anybody's<00:00:26.789> tag<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
largest you can do for anybody's tag so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.799 
largest you can do for anybody's tag so
you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.800> pretty<00:00:32.009> large<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.660> can

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you know so it's pretty large you can

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.590 
you know so it's pretty large you can
fill<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.290> ink<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:35.370> easily<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.329> twist

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
fill it up ink really easily just twist

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.580 
fill it up ink really easily just twist
the<00:00:36.750> end<00:00:36.899> off<00:00:38.989> put<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:45.539> nib<00:00:45.750> only<00:00:46.350> works

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the end off put it in the nib only works

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.660 
the end off put it in the nib only works
on<00:00:46.890> flat<00:00:47.520> surfaces<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:50.100> replaceable

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
on flat surfaces and it's replaceable

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
on flat surfaces and it's replaceable
but<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> hassle<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
but it's a hassle so just don't use it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.020 
but it's a hassle so just don't use it
on<00:00:52.920> rough<00:00:53.160> stuff<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.850> break

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
on rough stuff because it will break

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.500 
on rough stuff because it will break

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:42.510 

that's<00:01:34.939> on<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.270> side<00:01:37.119> that's<00:01:38.119> complete

that's<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.729> large<00:01:43.939> line<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:46.570> let's<00:01:47.570> take<00:01:48.049> it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that's the large line and let's take it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's the large line and let's take it
I<00:01:49.210> don't<00:01:50.210> know<00:01:50.270> stop<00:01:50.929> or<00:01:51.229> something<00:02:07.090> no<00:02:10.060> it's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
I don't know stop or something no it's

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.699 
I don't know stop or something no it's
how<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.269> roll<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.170> really<00:02:12.500> know<00:02:12.590> how<00:02:12.680> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
how I roll if you really know how to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.080 
how I roll if you really know how to
curve<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.310> can<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.760> sweet

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
curve it you can get really sweet

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
curve it you can get really sweet
quotations<00:02:17.590> look<00:02:18.590> really<00:02:18.860> nice<00:02:19.900> anyways<00:02:21.160> it's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
quotations look really nice anyways it's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.390 
quotations look really nice anyways it's
not<00:02:22.310> bad<00:02:23.260> I'd<00:02:24.260> say<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> downsides<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.310> you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
not bad I'd say the downsides that you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.640 
not bad I'd say the downsides that you
can<00:02:25.519> only<00:02:25.640> use<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:26.150> certain<00:02:26.510> places<00:02:29.650> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
can only use in certain places it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.289 
can only use in certain places it
doesn't<00:02:31.010> drip<00:02:31.250> doesn't<00:02:31.940> always<00:02:32.120> come<00:02:32.239> up

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
doesn't drip doesn't always come up

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.170 
doesn't drip doesn't always come up
clean<00:02:32.690> depending<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.319> life<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:34.180> flat

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
clean depending on life it's a flat

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.420 
clean depending on life it's a flat
enough<00:02:35.329> surface<00:02:35.739> plus<00:02:36.739> side<00:02:37.010> you're<00:02:37.220> going<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
enough surface plus side you're going to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.830 
enough surface plus side you're going to
feel<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.760> easily<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.480> small<00:02:38.690> enough

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
feel it really easily it's small enough

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.979 
feel it really easily it's small enough
to<00:02:39.079> hide<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:43.640> does<00:02:43.970> put<00:02:44.299> out<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> generally

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
to hide and it does put out a generally

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.400 
to hide and it does put out a generally
good<00:02:45.019> line<00:02:45.380> probably<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.040> best<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.400> any<00:02:46.519> fat

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
good line probably the best of any fat

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.059 
good line probably the best of any fat
nib<00:02:48.410> I've<00:02:48.590> seen<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:50.260> try<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.709> not<00:02:51.920> too

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
nib I've seen so try it out it's not too

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.310 
nib I've seen so try it out it's not too
expensive<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:54.310> some
