all<00:01:16.500> Natalie<00:01:16.920> could<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.310> bake<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> whole

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
all Natalie could just bake the whole

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.630 
all Natalie could just bake the whole
entire<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.340> attached

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
entire thing but it's actually attached

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.380 
entire thing but it's actually attached
to<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.090> plastic<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.690> can't<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.260> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to some plastic so I can't do that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.260 
to some plastic so I can't do that
you<00:01:25.080> could<00:01:25.380> unscrew<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> after<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you could unscrew it after you put the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230 
you could unscrew it after you put the
hole<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.080> bake<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
hole in it and bake it and then when it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
hole in it and bake it and then when it
comes<00:01:30.510> out<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.650> oven

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
comes out of the oven

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.210 
comes out of the oven
and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.520> ready<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:32.940> use<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.440> any<00:01:34.680> basic

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and it's ready to go use just any basic

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.990 
and it's ready to go use just any basic
super<00:01:35.640> glue<00:01:36.440> any<00:01:37.440> super<00:01:37.890> glue<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.490> hold<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
super glue any super glue will hold that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740 
super glue any super glue will hold that
metal<00:01:39.479> inside<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.260> or<00:01:40.470> jewelry<00:01:40.950> glue<00:01:41.750> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
metal inside there or jewelry glue and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.460 
metal inside there or jewelry glue and
the<00:01:43.620> other<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.010> do<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> teeny

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the other way to do it is I have a teeny

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
the other way to do it is I have a teeny
tiny<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:48.110> drill<00:01:50.240> bit<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.690> all<00:01:51.869> my

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
tiny little drill bit and all my

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
tiny little drill bit and all my
extremely<00:01:52.830> teeny<00:01:53.010> tiny<00:01:53.250> ones<00:01:53.460> I've<00:01:53.610> already

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
extremely teeny tiny ones I've already

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
extremely teeny tiny ones I've already
broken<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> show<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.560> bigger

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
broken so I have to show you the bigger

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
broken so I have to show you the bigger
one<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.220> can<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.909> solid<00:01:57.420> baked<00:01:58.229> clay

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
one but you can do on solid baked clay

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.219 
one but you can do on solid baked clay
like<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
like this

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
like this
I've<00:02:02.070> already<00:02:02.189> started<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.450> already

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I've already started but it's already

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.590 
I've already started but it's already
baked<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.340> use<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.210> fingers

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
baked and you can just use your fingers

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869 
baked and you can just use your fingers
and<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.439> hard<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.549> then<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and it's kind of hard to do but then you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.729 
and it's kind of hard to do but then you
don't<00:02:09.000> lose<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:09.720> detail<00:02:10.140> either<00:02:10.409> by

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
don't lose any detail either by

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:18.780 
don't lose any detail either by
squishing<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.450 

and<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:20.200> once<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.470> enough<00:02:21.710> out<00:02:21.950> just

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
and then once you have enough out just

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.030 
and then once you have enough out just
take<00:02:22.640> your<00:02:22.850> super<00:02:23.150> glue<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.630> put<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.800> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
take your super glue and put that in and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.310 
take your super glue and put that in and
just<00:02:25.190> superglue<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.840> super<00:02:27.170> glue

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
just superglue it in and that super glue

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.670 
just superglue it in and that super glue
will<00:02:27.500> hold<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.070> then<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.490> your
