00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.280
 My name is fernando ríos arroba ríos 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.570
 journalist on twitter and this occasion 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 they also find me on foursquare 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.940
 instagram and on facebook all networks 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.920
 social as arroba rivers journalist 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 good this time is I bring this 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.559
 extraordinary a boxing is a watch 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.650
 casio is a casio watch how can they 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:54.110
 you appreciate it is a watch model 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.950
 square a bit with 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.750
 a style we could say military is not 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.239
 properly a smart watch a watch 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.260
 sporty but it seems properly a 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.450
 watch with military characteristics and 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.460
 Well, I'm going to talk quickly about him 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.160
 I basically use since primary use 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.040
 casio watches or they already have a good 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.560
 time of this here we have one of the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.560
 that I use and well finally 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.000
 this I have always used a calculator 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.399
 we have the calculator clock and this 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 I like it a lot because it brings memories 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:45.030
 you have the opportunity to put the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 put the alarm memories 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.369
 phones with this is called the data bank 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.890
 I use this data bank a lot 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.369
 because it has a chronometer to swim here 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.450
 we have the chronometer is a is a clock 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.680
 that has the ability to submerge it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.150
 during 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.290
 what they call him 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.160
 without 50 meters that are 5 bar so 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.290
 they call and good brings five alarms you can 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.410
 put five alarms has calculator 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.240
 and another another time of the time is to say you 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.280
 you go to india or you go to china you go to 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.550

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.460
 It cost me about 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.460
 30000 james 30000 james they are doing 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.010
 the conversion weights plus weights less than 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.230
 what comes to my mind it costs 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.750
 300 pesos what it costs in Mexico this 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.360
 is a yes if you have never bought a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.720
 This clock costs 300 pesos and 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.340
 really is this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:02.209

 well done quite functional is a 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.439
 team that you can use this watch 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.500
 well finally here we have this other 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.590
 which is what I told them 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.540

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.819
 These are Japanese but good 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.250
 finally they are made in china too 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.370
 and good this one 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.110

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 around 300 pesos 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.440
 or perhaps 270 depending where 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.600
 buy if you go to liverpool or 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.390

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.410
 behind 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.960
 goes backwards the time and there they have a 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.980
 good map have a kind of map 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.710
 of the world 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.130
 the world time there is the whole planet 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.250
 land and in a minimum pita tells me 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.250
 right now where exactly is the use 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.940

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.220
 there is the light is really really bright 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.950

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.710
 400 pesos 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:16.420
 August 270 and it really is very very very 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.500
 very useful let's use it to swim 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.500
 for this 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.809
 for study 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.059
 Look at this timer to for 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.249
 put to put it in the jacuzzi always 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:34.550
 be taking ask me when everything 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:36.340
 one asks me for the time to see there is 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.620
 that focus to see 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.370
 there you see how the seconds there 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.280
 the seconds are running and well there 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.870
 the question of the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:54.620
 second hand that has it physically 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.800
 at 50 51 52 53 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.500
 and it's with a drink at 100 meters then 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.760
 well in summary it gives the true time that 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.070
 that is very important and very basic has 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.710
 world time here tokio tells me he tempted 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.470
 that such day at such time in Tokyo are 13 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.500
 hours in tokyo 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:18.529
 to the battery lasts 10 years here they say 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:22.509
 teniers newbery 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:26.139
 has the local time here alarm 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.960
 alarm also has look 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:34.080
 this is what I told them five alarms 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:37.199
 one two three four five five alarms 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.129
 account for back countdown with 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.139
 thousandth of a second 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.930
 that is very good 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.620
 the time for back and good basically 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.380
 that's it 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.419
 Well, I'm going to use it, I'll turn them 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.129
 comment how are you doing so while 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.930

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.990
 beauty a great watch 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.090
 I recommend the case I bring it a 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.770
 great affection my father always brought in 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.930
 rotation 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.729
 as they remember the former president Carlos 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.740
 danish de gortari as president them 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.020
 He put all the secretaries a clock 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.330
 something similar to this but not so modern 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.909
 but more basic a de facto a mica 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.220
 that was very much scratched and good gods 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.229
 that watch that at least that's why 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.009
 least it cost 30 pesos at that time 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:28.780
 then with the devaluation it cost 50 but 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.330
 good finally to all the secretaries 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.699
 of state president Carlos Salinas 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.669
 Gortari gave them a calcium so that 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:39.490
 Will use prohibited rolex cartier banned 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:42.139
 all kinds of watches and good 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:46.819
