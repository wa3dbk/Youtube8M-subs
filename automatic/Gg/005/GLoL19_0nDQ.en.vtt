that can be helpful

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.320 
that can be helpful
once<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> shape<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.400> curve<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
once I like the shape of my curve you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.380 
once I like the shape of my curve you
just<00:01:21.360> tap<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> sphere<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just tap on the sphere and that will it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
just tap on the sphere and that will it
will<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.259> mesh<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
will turn that into a mesh and then I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
will turn that into a mesh and then I
can<00:01:26.759> draw<00:01:26.939> another<00:01:26.970> hair<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.290> another

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
can draw another hair here or another

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
can draw another hair here or another
clump<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.400> hair<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.960> shape<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.439> tap<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.950> my

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
clump of hair and shape at and tap on my

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.569 
clump of hair and shape at and tap on my
mesh<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
mesh and I can just go through and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.859 
mesh and I can just go through and
continue<00:01:36.479> making<00:01:37.880> hair<00:01:38.960> layer<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.400> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
continue making hair layer it up and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.749 
continue making hair layer it up and
then<00:01:42.869> after<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> finish<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:43.649> stroke<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.520> just

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
then after I finish my stroke I can just

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.410 
then after I finish my stroke I can just
tap<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.689> canvas<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.090> leave<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> where

it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:50.000> after<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.420> basic<00:01:51.810> shapes

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it is after I get my basic shapes

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
it is after I get my basic shapes
I<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.149> re

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
I will then come back and and re

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.920 
I will then come back and and re
reposition<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> hair<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> make<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.899> how<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
reposition the hair and make it how I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.520 
reposition the hair and make it how I
like<00:01:58.549> by<00:01:59.549> using<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> curve<00:02:00.210> strap<00:02:00.540> brush<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
like by using the curve strap brush it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.620 
like by using the curve strap brush it
will<00:02:01.649> automatically<00:02:02.189> create<00:02:02.460> polygroups<00:02:03.270> for

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
will automatically create polygroups for

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.570 
will automatically create polygroups for
me<00:02:03.890> we'll<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:04.979> ahead<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> split<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.790> hair<00:02:06.030> off

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
me we'll go ahead and split the hair off

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.920 
me we'll go ahead and split the hair off
away<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> sphere<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.959> work<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.349> it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
away from the sphere so I can work on it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.000 
away from the sphere so I can work on it
and<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.500> can<00:02:12.680> see<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.430> set<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:14.030> my<00:02:14.780> brush<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and you can see I can set my my brush to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.990 
and you can see I can set my my brush to
auto<00:02:16.220> mask<00:02:16.579> based<00:02:16.879> off<00:02:17.180> polygroups

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
auto mask based off polygroups

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.479 
auto mask based off polygroups
and<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.120> I'll<00:02:20.239> go<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:21.049> move<00:02:21.799> brush<00:02:22.159> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
and then I'll go to my I move brush and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.610 
and then I'll go to my I move brush and
then<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:22.909> can<00:02:23.090> move<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:26.209> hair<00:02:29.079> away<00:02:30.079> from<00:02:30.260> this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
then I can move the hair away from this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:49.640 
then I can move the hair away from this
fear<00:02:31.040> sphere<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.670> shape<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.010> line<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.280> up

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.589 

and<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.489> also<00:02:50.730> use<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.769> trick<00:02:53.299> where<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.330> go

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
and I can also use this trick where I go

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.559 
and I can also use this trick where I go
into<00:02:54.780> my<00:02:54.959> crease<00:02:55.260> palette<00:02:57.530> under<00:02:58.530> geometry

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
into my crease palette under geometry

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.470 
into my crease palette under geometry
crease<00:03:03.470> put<00:03:04.470> down<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.950> crease<00:03:05.489> tolerance<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
crease put down the crease tolerance to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.399 
crease put down the crease tolerance to
around<00:03:07.140> 60<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.599> now<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.629> can<00:03:10.019> subdivide

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
around 60 or so and now I can subdivide

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:17.270 
around 60 or so and now I can subdivide
this<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.650> get<00:03:13.799> some<00:03:13.829> nice<00:03:14.159> clean<00:03:14.489> edges<00:03:16.280> hope

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
this and get some nice clean edges hope

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.819 
this and get some nice clean edges hope
that<00:03:17.489> helps
