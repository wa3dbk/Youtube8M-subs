here's<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.080> hand-cranked<00:00:16.710> tractor<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> reason

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
here's a hand-cranked tractor the reason

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.550 
here's a hand-cranked tractor the reason
you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:17.970> hand<00:00:18.240> crank<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> without<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> battery

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you can hand crank it without a battery

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.800 
you can hand crank it without a battery
or<00:00:19.680> anything<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.160> kind<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> magneto<00:00:20.970> magneto

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
or anything it's kind of magneto magneto

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.570 
or anything it's kind of magneto magneto
is<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.230> makes<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.680> spark<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.430> need

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
is what makes this spark you don't need

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.839 
is what makes this spark you don't need
a<00:00:23.609> battery<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> ten

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
a battery the thing about it is ten

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
a battery the thing about it is ten
crates<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.599> dangerous<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.680> ignition

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
crates can be dangerous if the ignition

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.970 
crates can be dangerous if the ignition
is<00:00:29.369> advanced<00:00:29.970> too<00:00:30.390> far<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> will<00:00:31.679> fire

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
is advanced too far then it will fire

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
is advanced too far then it will fire
and<00:00:32.189> don't<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.550> dare<00:00:32.759> step<00:00:33.210> over<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.630> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and don't you dare step over here in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.069 
and don't you dare step over here in
front<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.140> camera<00:00:34.380> okay<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> anyway<00:00:39.079> with

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
front of this camera okay so anyway with

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
front of this camera okay so anyway with
this<00:00:40.260> magneto<00:00:40.860> though<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.640> ignitions

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this magneto though the ignitions

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.080 
this magneto though the ignitions
retarded<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> fire<00:00:45.059> on

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
retarded so it's not going to fire on

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
retarded so it's not going to fire on
the<00:00:45.510> upstroke<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> pop<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.430> handle<00:00:47.910> back

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the upstroke and pop this handle back

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
the upstroke and pop this handle back
and<00:00:48.149> hurt<00:00:48.660> me<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.920> something

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and hurt me so I'm going to do something

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
and hurt me so I'm going to do something
that<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.670> normally<00:00:50.989> not<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that you would normally not want to be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
seen doing and that's pushing down on

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.270 
seen doing and that's pushing down on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
through the viewfinder if that thing is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
through the viewfinder if that thing is
showing<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.340> anyway<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.070> I'm<00:01:11.070> going

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.080 

throughout<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.510> board<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.860> see<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.130> root<00:02:31.459> chop

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
throughout the board you see a root chop

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.350 
throughout the board you see a root chop
it<00:02:32.330> out<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.160> trip<00:02:34.430> over<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.819> rope<00:02:35.120> or
