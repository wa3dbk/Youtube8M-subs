00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.630
 two 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.599
 hello how are you the day I will teach you 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.519
 another trend for this season 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:12.390
 autumn / winter will be of a well delineated 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.640
 graphic and marking that is the protagonist 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.520
 I'm going to start cleaning the face 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.210
 printed use of the bio shorts line 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 of biotherm is called train clients without 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.800
 you see these murals makeup 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.800
 for normal mixed skin 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.700
 as a second plus to use stores inc 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.330
 I'm going to apply cocaine cotton and I pass it 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.330
 by the crostis 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.520
 as eye contour I'm going to use 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.590
 the ultra light cream of our gena with 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.710
 a little on the clumsiest finger you 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.710
 they know and applied it in control up 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.790
 this is a forward especially for 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.090
 oily or mixed skin with 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.670
 fat tendency and what it does is that it 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.369
 comedogenic and eliminates 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.380
 imperfections with the step of makeup 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.810
 You can use the line and true life 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.020
 the bicrim of god or 'the sun' that this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.780
 I really like what the blog does 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.780
 a while back and apply with your fingers 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.750
 as if it were a cream is for everyone 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.780
 to fix the makeup you can use 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 the technical medical powder mouse 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380
 head on 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 and under the leaves 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.830
 now we go to the eyes to give a basis 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.880
 of color very used on the subject of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.660
 benefit the tone flag sermin apply 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.660
 with the finger 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.160
 now we go to the most important part 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.090
 of the video in which we are going to do delineated 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.490
 what we are going to do is a little ball that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 it comes out as another depth out 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.090
 the characteristic that is not attached to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.090
 no delineated inside the eye 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.170
 there are six positions to install in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.470
 black color and one says the vice wash 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.270
 Diagonal cut and very firm I will take 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.660
 a little product 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.900
 and I'm going to start making the day 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.600
 first draw a straight line that arrives 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.120
 just to the depth we are going to trace 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.310
 a diagonal line creating a triangle 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.070
 the last step of filling the triangle 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.110
 without reaching the mobile eyelid, so 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.270
 2 am has obviously been outlined as a 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.330
 freehand link to block exactly 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.380

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.020

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.580

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.160
 Now I'm going to apply a balm with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.170
 moisturizing color and to give volume of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 the clear brand that is called instant 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.970
 natural light perfect link 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.210
 I will see flying in cheeks with 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.660
 the cheating color of will brown in the 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.660
 number 10 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.290
 good girls this is the end of a look 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.989
 very unusable is very fashionable 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.920
 especially for the most closely fought 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.019
 I hope you like it, put it on 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.650
 practice and we can and do not think they're 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.650
 well back
