performed well for us but it created

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.039 
performed well for us but it created
this<00:02:00.869> void<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.280> want<00:02:02.549> Mortal<00:02:02.909> Kombat<00:02:03.360> like

DLC we're gonna see a mixture it you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.259 
DLC we're gonna see a mixture it you
know<00:02:58.989> if<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.349> certainly<00:02:59.709> if<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> was<00:03:00.129> my<00:03:00.310> call<00:03:00.579> I

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
know if I certainly if it was my call I

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.289 
know if I certainly if it was my call I
think<00:03:01.780> we<00:03:01.900> would<00:03:02.079> certainly<00:03:02.319> have<00:03:02.769> some<00:03:03.299> some

think we would certainly have some some

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.170 
think we would certainly have some some
free<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.629> some<00:03:04.840> paid<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:06.190> suspect<00:03:06.819> that's<00:03:06.940> what

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
free and some paid I suspect that's what

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.369 
free and some paid I suspect that's what
we're<00:03:07.299> gonna<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.599> but<00:03:07.629> i<00:03:07.810> certainly<00:03:08.049> don't
