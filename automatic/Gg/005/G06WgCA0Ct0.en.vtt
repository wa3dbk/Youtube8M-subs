00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.240
 today we talk about problem solution 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 many times most 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.929
 people especially those from 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.519
 children were not good math 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.009
 whenever they are in front of a 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.619
 something they call a problem is like 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 cece paralyzed rowe we must also 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.710
 know that for the most part instead 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 people who were fine 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.510
 math problem only means 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 something waiting for a solution for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.840
 most of the people instead 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 problem is something that blocks us and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.360
 first stop asking us what a is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 problem is where a problem comes from 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.270
 always many times it is thought that the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.250
 problem comes from outside something 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.210
 that outside of us while the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 problem our attitude 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.559
 compared to that event that is us 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 we have an external event that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.370
 we consider in a certain way 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 then it's our attitude like 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 solve it because problem means 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.969
 something to solve it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 an interesting thing compared to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 problems there would be so many things to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 say and find out from now that every 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.359
 time we actually say a problem 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 we have a solution that we don't like and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.470
 I give two small examples just to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 enter the topic a person eats 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 burgers and fries 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 after eating he may have pain 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 stomach and a person could also 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 say I have digestion problems 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.420
 while this pain could be the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.979
 solution that the stomach adopted for 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.170
 don't let us eat more hamburgers e 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.750
 chips that is what I call problem 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 actually a solution for ours 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.460
 body to warn us stop with 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 burgers and fries they could do 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 system tide in a more manner 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.259
 deep 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.060
 but when we also talk about it looks like the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.909
 problem solution many people say 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 I have an emotional problem for example 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.979
 I'm afraid of kittens many people 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 may have this kind of interaction 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 with kittens I don't say with cats 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.810
 great own with the bad guys and says ho 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.479
 this problem 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.270
 I could say something else he learned 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.299
 to interact with fear with respect to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 kittens and the solution he found 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.100
 find another to be quiet 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.049
 when he sees a kitten he is always knowing 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.759
 what we call problem is one 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.400
 our answer is something we have 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.880
 learned an automatism that we don't like 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.490
 more 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.310
 I'll give another example no one would say 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.180
 I fear entering the cage of a 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.210
 hungry lion 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.460
 it is not a problem to have this fear but 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.830
 for example I am afraid to enter one 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.220
 cage with kittens are people say 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.020
 I have this problem or this fear says 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.600
 I also have this problem 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.700
 that means I call my problem a problem 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.250
 attitude towards an event 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.560
 external that I don't recognize as right and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.360
 functional for me we can integrate 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.950
 within us these concepts and then there 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 we will deepen in a next episode
