hand and you know you may be having
trouble<00:02:13.700> when<00:02:13.790> again<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.420> set<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.840> and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
trouble when again so just set that and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.170 
trouble when again so just set that and
then<00:02:15.440> no<00:02:15.560> getting<00:02:15.920> five<00:02:16.130> brand<00:02:16.430> new<00:02:16.580> cards<00:02:16.970> and

then no getting five brand new cards and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.630 
then no getting five brand new cards and
you<00:02:17.510> may<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:17.959> able<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.380> work<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:19.310> way<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.459> of

you may be able to work your way out of
this<00:02:19.760> situation<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.720> my<00:02:21.470> reasoning<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.010> that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
this situation so my reasoning on that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640 
this situation so my reasoning on that
of<00:02:23.090> course<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:24.019> if<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.320> have<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> money

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
of course you know if you have the money

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.430 
of course you know if you have the money
go<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.459> get<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.700> doom<00:02:25.880> caliber<00:02:26.360> night<00:02:26.569> go<00:02:27.350> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
go and get the doom caliber night go and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.259 
go and get the doom caliber night go and
get<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> pot<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.980> duality<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.880> you'll<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.239> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
get the pot of duality and you'll have a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.600 
get the pot of duality and you'll have a
much<00:02:29.360> better<00:02:29.720> duck<00:02:30.050> but<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.040> said<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.400> is

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
