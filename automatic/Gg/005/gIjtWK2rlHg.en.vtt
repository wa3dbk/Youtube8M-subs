00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
of your car I prefer driving at the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
of your car I prefer driving at the
furthest<00:01:42.990> distance<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> camera<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
furthest distance with the camera but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.190 
furthest distance with the camera but
others<00:01:44.820> might<00:01:45.030> enjoy<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.479> front<00:01:45.750> seat<00:01:45.960> view

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
being the first in the series definitely

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.040 
being the first in the series definitely
had<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.090> work<00:01:57.300> on<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.780> next

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
had a lot to work on for the next

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.900

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
versions to come you didn't really have

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.460 
versions to come you didn't really have
