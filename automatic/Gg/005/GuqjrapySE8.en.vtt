00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.890 

so<00:00:10.460> from<00:00:11.059> this<00:00:11.209> basic<00:00:12.969> attack<00:00:13.969> here<00:00:14.299> we<00:00:14.719> move

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
so from this basic attack here we move

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140 
so from this basic attack here we move
here<00:00:15.259> we<00:00:15.860> start<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.219> break<00:00:16.369> his<00:00:16.550> posture<00:00:16.789> as<00:00:17.029> we

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
here we start to break his posture as we

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.960 
here we start to break his posture as we
enter<00:00:17.660> we<00:00:18.200> can<00:00:18.380> kick<00:00:18.619> here<00:00:18.919> and<00:00:19.550> come<00:00:19.789> into

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
enter we can kick here and come into

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.900 
enter we can kick here and come into
here<00:00:20.270> strike<00:00:20.900> across<00:00:21.169> his<00:00:21.410> face<00:00:21.650> here<00:00:22.520> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
here strike across his face here and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.939 
here strike across his face here and
then<00:00:23.419> stepping<00:00:23.720> over<00:00:23.960> this<00:00:24.199> way<00:00:24.410> kicking<00:00:24.860> as

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
then stepping over this way kicking as

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.419 
then stepping over this way kicking as
he's<00:00:25.099> falling<00:00:25.630> so<00:00:26.630> another<00:00:27.170> idea<00:00:27.380> in<00:00:27.800> Jitsu<00:00:28.189> is

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
he's falling so another idea in Jitsu is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.339 
he's falling so another idea in Jitsu is
to<00:00:28.759> try<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.060> hit<00:00:29.210> people<00:00:29.449> from<00:00:29.810> angles<00:00:30.230> that

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
to try and hit people from angles that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.650 
to try and hit people from angles that
they're<00:00:30.500> not<00:00:30.650> seeing<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.580> take<00:00:32.089> it<00:00:32.239> kicking

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
they're not seeing so take it kicking

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.660 
they're not seeing so take it kicking
them<00:00:32.809> or<00:00:33.019> striking<00:00:33.470> them<00:00:33.769> in<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.250> middle<00:00:34.519> of<00:00:34.550> a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
them or striking them in the middle of a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.910 
them or striking them in the middle of a
throw<00:00:35.000> or<00:00:35.330> while<00:00:36.230> their<00:00:36.440> posture<00:00:36.830> is

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
throw or while their posture is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.100 
throw or while their posture is
completely<00:00:37.370> broken<00:00:37.699> it's<00:00:38.330> a<00:00:38.510> perfect<00:00:38.989> place

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
completely broken it's a perfect place

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.090 
completely broken it's a perfect place
when<00:00:39.620> I'm<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.040> close<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.760> him<00:00:41.000> here<00:00:42.100> most

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
difficult for him to defend so that

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.990 
difficult for him to defend so that
would<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.799> say<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.070> was<00:01:01.159> like<00:01:01.189> a<00:01:01.280> basic<00:01:01.760> move

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
would you say that was like a basic move

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.149 
would you say that was like a basic move
in<00:01:02.150> ninjutsu<00:01:02.449> then<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:03.379> throw<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:04.040> we've

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
in ninjutsu then that throw that we've

and now you can look at the needs of a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
and now you can look at the needs of a
hand<00:01:48.840> strike<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> face<00:01:49.820> here<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.509> me<00:01:52.579> yeah
