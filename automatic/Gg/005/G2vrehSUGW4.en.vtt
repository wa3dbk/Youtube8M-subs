00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.620
 Journalists are supposed to be egg legend 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.389
 be woolly milk 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.700
 so it has a Bavarian once 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.350
 Prime Minister formulated translated 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
 means that they should actually from 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.379
 have a clue 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.360
 but that works in practice 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.990
 rarely because who can already 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.289
 claim in physics chemistry or just 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.529
 Economics always 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.890
 to be saddle-hard at least what the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.839
 economic sciences 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.769
 could that be a near future 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.419
 little change 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.890
 at the university mannheim becomes the 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.350
 next semester the bachelor 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.850
 study course culture and economics media 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.100
 and communication science 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.470
 introduced matthias kohring is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.680
 professor of media and media 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.880
 communication sciences at the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.370
 university mannheim 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.570
 besides, the dean of studies he has essentially 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.400
 on the development of the new 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.410
 study course worked 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.910
 Mr. Professor Koring for which 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.120
 occupational fields is the new study course 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.440
 So I thought so for all of them 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.640
 Do not call in any way 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.990
 to make economic decisions 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.870
 have and that are in my opinion 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.300
 more and more think of the pr 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.920
 activity in detail has to work on 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.390
 activities in the media management 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 communication management in big ones 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.110
 Media houses where you can conduct business 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.520
 positions more and more decision 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.320
 must also fell with the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 economic consequences 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.100
 are 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.140
 what distinguishes him what can his 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 graduates later more than colleagues the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.610
 go through classical training courses 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 all have what they can do more 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.300
 to combine different perspectives 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.920
 if you follow the classic training path 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.720
 then one has in his area 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.979
 a lot of clue but has the problem 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.050
 to have to look over the plate 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.210
 that is not always optimally solved when 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.760
 then you have this combined study 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 is it so that you are virtually different 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.790
 equivalent 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.380
 can take into account 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.210
 how can you get the training path 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 their future students 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.860
 So students introduce themselves in the media 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.060
 communication scientists to everything 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.729
 something with public and media 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.770
 communication has touched that 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.450
 fields like the media effect the process 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.159
 public opinion forming the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.440
 media system as it is constructed the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.119
 globalization of the media world on the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640
 paths through large media groups 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.479
 is added a bit of folk 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.729
 and business administration 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.080
 the demo almost like the management of 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.689
 media houses the communication 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.690
 management marketing but also that 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.460
 accountancy 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.740
 as they appreciate the job opportunities of their 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.770
 graduates home 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.520
 the graduates of the media 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.960
 communication science seems very 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.460
 Good chances on the job market too 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.360
 if have one now 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.590
 business 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.900
 economic education added 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.310
 then i think that's the chance 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 So it will be even better 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.760
 I do not have any worries 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.890
 Mr. Professor Koring thank you for 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.060
 this conversation 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.830
 christoph gebhardt is managing director 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.630
 of the philosophical faculty and is of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.250
 the success model bachelor cultures 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.900
 economy briefly baku how convinced mr 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.730
 Gebhardt Mr. Professor koring has the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.880
 ask about the job opportunities of his 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.380
 I answer very positively 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.230
 you still want to ask again 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.910
 discuss with them the baku as there are 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.010
 It has been around for a number of years 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.350
 for various other study subjects 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.010
 Many graduates are already in butter 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.830
 and bread 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.360
 we are there your experiences yes the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.190
 Experiences are very good we have 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.500
 many years of experience with the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.060
 preliminary course of study was very good 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.070
 the graduates had asked 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.330
 above-average career opportunities 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.920
 At the moment we speak of 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.209
 full employment and more often from 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.680
 skilled employees lack 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.750
 so the experiences are natural 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.700
 very, very good, but it is too 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.070
 take into account that a majority of 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.480
 baku as graduates the varied 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.670
 use possibilities and in the connection 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.290
 However, a master study completed 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 we notice that more and more baku 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.660
 like graduates go straight to the job 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.820
 the baku how is the model of success of the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.459
 Mannheim University looks at what 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.140
 is actually behind it 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.810
 On the one hand, it is the combination 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.110
 of humanities and one 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.030
 Economics yes 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.519
 in a way, to the profile of the university 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 and for the students for the 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.100
 of course, it is very good 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.739
 interesting they lie down for three 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.080
 years firmly on this combination can 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.000
 then directly into the job can 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.400
 Studying master culture and economics 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.170
 can study a pure bwl master 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.650
 or a pure one 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.140
 humanities master that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.170
 It is called a very flexible model what 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.209
 many possibilities offered 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.700
 they said it himself as the Bakun offers 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.220
 many possibilities which combinations 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.410
 is there because we can now 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.789
 every study subject at the faculty in the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.229
 frame of the bachelor culture and 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.270
 that means for the economy 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.930
 three philology anglistics germanistik 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.610
 and Romance studies 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.280
 for the story for the philosophy 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.080
 and now for the fall winter semester too 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.150
 for the media and 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.860
 communication science which 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.690
 meaning in this context 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.310
 that the university mannheim as one 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.949
 of the leading universities in the field 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.720
 of economics applies yes 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.400
 Of course that is very helpful for us 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.930
 that we are such a renowned bwl 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.090
 faculty win here as a partner 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.370
 could mean partnership 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.860
 at the same time that of course we too 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.690
 the bwl humanities teaching 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.490
 and export learning content 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.470
 foreign language competence culture space 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.470
 competence we are very glad that 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.820
 works very well 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.979
 At the same time, I would also like to 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.900
 point out that yes the philosophical 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.639
 Faculty now also very very good 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.400
 ranking result for several years 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.699
 years, that's why we're with the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.539
 situation very satisfied, of course 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.479
 You can apply for this 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.849
 study course until 15 july 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.599
 what should applicants in your view 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.610
 bring 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.289
 yes of course it's a very strong one 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.570
 requested course of study so we are 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.090
 overbooked several times so it needs one 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.070
 good high school it does not have 10 or 12 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.530
 his high school diploma but it really should be 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.000
 very good high school studies were 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.400
 relevant services therefore German 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.050
 Foreign language mathematics are important and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.010
 Surely a curiosity too 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.930
 the different disciplines 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.479
 to engage in mind and on 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.440
 economics adored 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.440
 Thank you for this conversation
