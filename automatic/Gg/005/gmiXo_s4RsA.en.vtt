humans and hide their tracks I think

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.310 
humans and hide their tracks I think
they<00:00:10.860> wanted<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> punish<00:00:11.460> them<00:00:11.990> allowing<00:00:12.990> me

they wanted to punish them allowing me

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.430 
they wanted to punish them allowing me
to<00:00:13.610> do<00:00:14.610> that's<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.660> humans<00:00:16.230> couldn't

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
to do that's why humans couldn't

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.130

yeah and then get off the blue thing get
out<00:01:55.770> she<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.220> portal<00:01:56.520> somewhere<00:01:56.700> else<00:01:57.740> no<00:01:58.740> way

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
out she to portal somewhere else no way

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:17.810 
out she to portal somewhere else no way
oh<00:02:00.950> yeah<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:15.320> understand<00:02:16.320> myself<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.580> need

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.920 

yeah<00:05:09.610> they're<00:05:09.910> here<00:05:10.150> or<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.380> see<00:05:11.920> I<00:05:12.240> see<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.270> see

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
yeah they're here or I see I see I see

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.050 
yeah they're here or I see I see I see
that's<00:05:14.350> plenty<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.040> was<00:05:15.580> gonna<00:05:15.730> do<00:05:15.910> that

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
that's plenty that I was gonna do that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.600 
that's plenty that I was gonna do that
but<00:05:16.210> with<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.390> momentum<00:05:17.370> didn't<00:05:18.370> work<00:05:18.490> with

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
but with the momentum didn't work with

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.990 
but with the momentum didn't work with
the<00:05:18.700> momentum<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:21.070> start<00:05:21.340> preparing<00:05:21.580> for

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
the momentum to start preparing for

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.420 
the momentum to start preparing for
human<00:05:22.570> testing<00:05:22.750> again<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.590> checked<00:05:24.100> an<00:05:24.250> old
