something

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
something

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
something

available on the screen is kind of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420 
available on the screen is kind of
jarring<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> sizable<00:01:43.860> imbalance

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

between enemy projectiles and how

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
between enemy projectiles and how
quickly<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.649> able<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> move<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
quickly you're able to move you can

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.609

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
buttons which is a nice touch but it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.819 
buttons which is a nice touch but it
doesn't<00:01:51.630> make<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> move<00:01:52.079> any<00:01:52.259> quicker<00:01:52.560> and
