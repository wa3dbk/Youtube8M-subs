00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 and this apprentice of the group raúl asencio 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.830
 that we are going to do a few followed so 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.320
 I am a typical dessert of the week 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.690
 santa in the easter 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 and good very appetizing in this reflection 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 to do the follow-up we will use 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.409
 very noble ingredients that are the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.500
 virgin olive oil and eggs 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.199
 flour and for the thing to go up we're going 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.360
 to put a little drive us 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.610
 helper this machine in the easy ball 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.059
 and so much work that we go to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.040
 do to understand in the solids that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.040
 are is the flour with the impeller 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.970
 the ingredients 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.630
 let's proceed to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 to show the eggs 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.609
 let's go take the eggs 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.180
 and we 're going we're going to beat a little is 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.920
 a security measure we will beat 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.400
 a cum we are going to run 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.400
 so 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.890
 the accessory 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.360
 here 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.849
 na 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.530
 20 we put the oil 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 and we put it 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.370
 then 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.370
 let's incorporate 2 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.340
 you do not know what it is to record a 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 video tutorial with my son raúl 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.560
 if you do not have it, do not worry 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.560
 in a ball with a 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.240
 you 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.140
 same 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.830
 and me 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.080
 we have 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.840
 for cupcakes can also be made 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.380
 on siliconized paper you can put 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.550
 silicone could be made but several and 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.860
 one thing is that the silicone paper as 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.860
 in the sponge cake 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.560
 and everyone who uses the paper that 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.990
 want according to the result you want 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.300
 you will see that with the written paper we 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.360
 it is more aesthetic 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.490
 good in simple singles this 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.919
 simple does not carry sugar therefore 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.169
 a diabetic person could consume it 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.970
 perfectly and no longer carries the sugar 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.319
 it also allows us to make salty 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.560
 then we could put some pipes 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:39.310
 we could put part of salt we can 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.310
 knowledge 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:47.820
 dry and snacks every day 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.820
 we will make it thinner and we would practice 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.350
 Well, here we have our equipment 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.780
 and now let's proceed to concepts 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.880
 We put preheated normal to 200 degrees 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.870
 that is very important we should never 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.900
 put a piece of any kind 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.900
 inside the oven and without the oven 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.060
 hot we already have 200 degrees and now 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.060
 we simply produce 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.000
 you know 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.370
 I would lose 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.740
 already 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.939
 take care when we place in the 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:43.039
 oven because it goes up a lot and if we put 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.020
 too many trays are going to hit us 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.089
 with each other we must also leave 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.129
 enough space to be counted 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:52.759
 with enough ventilation 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.759
 there we have them 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.930
 good what we have done sports of 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.789
 power 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.949
 we have broken the game it has been consented 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.949
 karina we mixed 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.510
 the instrument to then beaten during 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.100
 one hour 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.860
 with 200 degrees 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.950
 and now we have here as a result 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.140
 wonderful 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.140
 chocolate winds and other cutlery 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.440
 and if we want to put some 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.080
 good morning until next time 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.889
 from too far
