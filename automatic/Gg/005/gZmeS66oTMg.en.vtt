 expert at home who already talk to us 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.189
 about half of those that almost 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 they say that remembering is reliving or more than 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.730
 a return to the same thing not 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 relive and relive practically 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.529

 in song in a photograph now a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 good photography requires a good 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 profession finds construction a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 calderÃ³n a fermata who already us 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 accompanies and gives us talk about the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 photograph as the profession as he 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.390
 is and how he practices it and how he 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 designed to this day how are you living 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 football we are very happy to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 have you here or because I am from 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 true that we say that the moment it falls 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 the fire that photo that you remember 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.030
 when the bonus you remember when the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.289
 friend the photographs are part of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 our memories to this day 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
 creation if after the photos are the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.520
 moments captured then are the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 moments but remember to drink them 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 is when the satisfaction comes as I 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 photographer 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 and now people are very happy 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.200
 when you discovered that he was the photographer 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 it was only by accident here I was 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.040
 my life with a camera next door that is the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 photographer who can engineer this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 office and therefore not finding work 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 I decided to dedicate myself to what I liked the most 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.399
 and I think it was doing well and that you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.740
 I do well and you can really 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.690
 accidents now requires 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 talent is not so easy because many 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.899
 we believe professional photographers with 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
 our cameras but it's not like that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.640
 it requires a talent of a certain 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 vision and a contact not for that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.220
 encapsulate exactly that moment but 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.190
 It requires good taste to be 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.429
 requires a dedicated one a certain 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.899
 sensitivity also for to be able 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.179
 capture those moments to create those 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.159
 images whatever it is then 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.480
 Of course you have to have liked that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.090
 sensitivity 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.690
 talking to him he liked that sensitivity 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.250
 I suppose you should have some 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.550
 34 cameras how many cameras does a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.200
 photographer like you use one each each 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.020
 situation should not that he used something else 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 small is working a handbags something 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.580
 a little bigger this 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.920
 they depend on the situation the percentage 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 How much does the camera provide? 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 bring your eye I do not know when it's going to 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 lock and given 90 95 percent and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 then the next 5 percent and it's going to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.750
 be the team of everything that I have already arrived 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 up here by my own eyes 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 own merits and the team is going to be a 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 to come out a little more and now 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.410
 there is as such a career in photography 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.480
 no longer before I think it was like the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.790
 matters within the communication and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.940
 on it there is professionalization 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.799
 as such how long do you have it 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.630
 to study there are watching me 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.160
 some images of what you 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.799
 pressed from Latin last night how much 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.560
 time is required to have the 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.630
 profession as such because you can 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.810
 study a degree in photography 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.540
 photographer is being licensed this 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.209
 I will last from four to twelve months 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.150
 depends on the specialization depends on 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.910
 what to do there are graduates there is this 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.760
 seminar is internet where we can not 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.030
 learn enough 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 they're the kind of thing that calls me a lot 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.950
 the attention that outside the area 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.659
 we were talking about the existence of 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.489
 professionalization in certain 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.470
 specific there are photographers who are 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.750
 they only take photos of 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.549
 no food and for such specialization it 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.260
 it also requires a study how many 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.060
 specialties there are or that you know or that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.970
 they call you more attention because you can 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.280
 devote 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.780
 see report trophy has after 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.660
 work for a study for a 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.870
 magazine for a newspaper you can have 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.720
 your own freelance fish study is 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.430
 very common, I'm not a freelancer 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.650
 we like it more about city is that 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.390
 I have my own business and I'm not 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.550
 water holding small jobs face 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.260
 a mike thing to the food not to devote that 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.480
 kind of things I have done very well 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.580
 specialization of your subjects in your 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.220
 subject me doctor to people for example to 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.170
 we saw it habitat doctor people the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.440
 people are the ones that I like 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.160
 Wedding photographer and photos of people 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.100
 personal deal then it depends 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.940
 awaits specialization of that training 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.100
 what do you do 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.230
 and where I study here is something that 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.270
 you have to go updating day by day 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.910
 things change you have to educate yourself 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.970
 you have to nurture other things because I 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.409
 nourish it half of see data philosophy 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.989
 for music art 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.580
 and me what do you have to do all 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:47.369
 the photograph nurtured of other things not 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.139
 only photographic is for those who are 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:50.939
 studying those who want or pretend 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.700
 studying photography is a career 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.650
 costly 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.920
 it's a cost as a professional because the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.060
 same jobs are being done 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.220
 soft there is no new to buy the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.350
 other things and I would not recommend 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.180
 study photography as such if you want 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.390
 be a photographer you have to think if 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.980
 you want to do it because you like it or if 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.620
 you want to earn money from there if 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.060
 he wants from starting to do 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.370
 to be closer to the business is not 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.030
 you have to raise business more than the 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.740
 photograph of the football poster then 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.430
 this 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.349
 the seven-way joke little by little 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.479
 to be able to nourish that photograph I 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.190
 I would say the most you like is but the 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:43.789
 photograph dedicate yourself to that and then in 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:45.979
 practice these ten thousand hours of 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.910
 practice something to do web 10,000 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.690
 new to dedicate a whole year there is a 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.539
 year 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.750
 then practice it as football as 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:00.199
 anything else we are seeing more 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.340
 example of what of your work which has 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.210
 been the greatest satisfaction you've ever 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.729
 had to today 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.670
 when working with people the first 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.420
 Satisfaction comes when I see the photo 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.310
 that's what I'm getting the 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.110
 satisfaction is when you were taught to 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.060
 someone and you manage to move him 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.130
 then to incite something that calls a 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.730
 fiber is a memory I know something that wants 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.040
 a dream something you need in the case of 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.560
 weddings that memory of the voice say 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.210
 this I did not see it and on topic you are not 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.750
 teaching is amazing 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.910
 how to create the heavy ones that you directed us 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.900
 in such a way that is what there is between 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.479
 he and I 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.310
 it is seen in this source the face covered the 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.440
 bed all that kind of stuff 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.060
 in the photo captured this is the 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.490
 satisfaction that you can suddenly 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.530
 get wedding salts and people you 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.950
 thank you I was and have even seen 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.009
 a photo because it's why 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.839
 it is a moment captured 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.669
 hear now what do you say about moments 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:05.069
 reflected the face of the couple when 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.020
 you know them and they agree and the 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.960
 face that you photograph the day of 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.539
 event are two totally different are 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.810
 all different is to go working with 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:18.100
 them during all that day 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:22.460
 so that they get used to that I was 11 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.940
 and that they live their wedding to capture it the 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.940
 more natural way 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.610
 all the video the idea of ââmy photography 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.070
 wedding is that they see their photos as 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.870
 it would be the lighting the stress are 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:40.090
 Nervous stressed because so many 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.130
 Thank you for having been with us and 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.630
 Well, the photos are already taken by the soul 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.630
 someday when he got married we're going
