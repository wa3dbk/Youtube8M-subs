00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
hey guys Bex here and the question for

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.230 
hey guys Bex here and the question for
this<00:00:10.720> quick<00:00:10.960> video<00:00:11.110> is<00:00:11.400> how<00:00:12.400> in<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.670> world<00:00:12.700> do

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
this quick video is how in the world do

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.090 
this quick video is how in the world do
you<00:00:13.270> enchant<00:00:13.690> some<00:00:14.350> of<00:00:14.469> these<00:00:14.530> items<00:00:14.890> that<00:00:14.980> I

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
you enchant some of these items that I

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.160 
you enchant some of these items that I
do<00:00:15.750> well<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.670> some<00:00:18.910> normal<00:00:19.330> items<00:00:19.660> it's<00:00:19.840> very

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
do well for some normal items it's very

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.560 
do well for some normal items it's very
the<00:00:21.070> easiest<00:00:21.580> way<00:00:21.760> is<00:00:22.650> say<00:00:23.650> you<00:00:24.610> get<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.880> single

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
the easiest way is say you get a single

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.929 
the easiest way is say you get a single
player<00:00:25.869> commands<00:00:26.200> mod<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:27.310> once<00:00:27.669> you<00:00:27.790> have

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
player commands mod and once you have

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.670 
player commands mod and once you have
that<00:00:28.119> mod<00:00:28.329> installed<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:29.079> I'm<00:00:29.380> not<00:00:29.500> going<00:00:29.619> to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
that mod installed and I'm not going to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.200 
that mod installed and I'm not going to
go<00:00:29.770> into<00:00:29.950> how<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.160> install<00:00:30.610> mods<00:00:30.849> or<00:00:31.029> where<00:00:31.180> to

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
go into how to install mods or where to

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.000 
go into how to install mods or where to
get<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.540> just<00:00:31.720> Google<00:00:31.989> search<00:00:32.200> single<00:00:32.950> player

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
get it just Google search single player

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.700 
get it just Google search single player
commands<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.790> on<00:00:34.540> it'll<00:00:35.170> be<00:00:35.200> like<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.560> first

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
commands and on it'll be like the first

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.400 
commands and on it'll be like the first
result<00:00:36.070> probably<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.780> can<00:00:38.170> find

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
result probably and you can find

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.410 
result probably and you can find
installation<00:00:38.949> instructions<00:00:39.430> there<00:00:39.789> on<00:00:40.269> the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
installation instructions there on the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.610 
installation instructions there on the
gasp<00:00:40.600> thread<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.809> can't<00:00:44.230> be<00:00:44.320> your<00:00:44.440> tech

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
gasp thread so it can't be your tech

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.979 
gasp thread so it can't be your tech
support<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.100> regard<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.480> just<00:00:46.690> install

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
support in that regard but just install

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.389 
support in that regard but just install
that<00:00:47.019> mod<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.679> then<00:00:48.489> you<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.539> do<00:00:50.399> enchant

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
that mod and then you can do enchant

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.799 
that mod and then you can do enchant
list<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:53.410> for<00:00:54.160> this<00:00:54.250> iron<00:00:55.089> axe<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.600> have

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
list and then for this iron axe I have

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.360 
list and then for this iron axe I have
for<00:00:56.109> example<00:00:56.140> enchant<00:00:57.629> add<00:00:59.070> what<00:01:00.070> do<00:01:00.129> we<00:01:00.219> want

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
for example enchant add what do we want

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.489 
for example enchant add what do we want
to<00:01:00.429> put<00:01:00.550> on<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:00.789> how<00:01:01.300> about<00:01:01.449> efficiency<00:01:02.050> now<00:01:02.440> I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
to put on it how about efficiency now I

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.829 
to put on it how about efficiency now I
could<00:01:02.710> type<00:01:02.890> out<00:01:03.010> efficiency<00:01:03.579> or<00:01:03.879> I<00:01:03.910> could

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
could type out efficiency or I could

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.920 
could type out efficiency or I could
just<00:01:04.870> type<00:01:05.370> 32<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.670> then<00:01:07.240> rank<00:01:07.420> 10

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
just type 32 and then rank 10

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.620 
just type 32 and then rank 10
so<00:01:08.800> there's<00:01:08.980> efficiency<00:01:09.580> tin<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.420> iron

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
so there's efficiency tin on this iron

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.940 
so there's efficiency tin on this iron
axe<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:14.320> makes<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.590> just<00:01:14.620> plow<00:01:14.920> through

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
axe and that makes it just plow through

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.130 
axe and that makes it just plow through
stuff<00:01:15.460> like<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:18.300> but<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.420> know<00:01:19.540> what<00:01:19.690> that's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
stuff like that but you know what that's

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.580 
stuff like that but you know what that's
easy

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
easy

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.650 
easy
anyone<00:01:21.040> can<00:01:21.130> do<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:22.530> me<00:01:23.760> me<00:01:24.760> who<00:01:25.300> cares<00:01:25.510> about

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
gonna not gonna really do a tutorial on

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.820 
gonna not gonna really do a tutorial on
it<00:02:12.760> but<00:02:13.510> basically<00:02:13.959> what<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.440> want<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> do

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
this is the quick and dirty easy thing

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.830 
this is the quick and dirty easy thing
to<00:02:17.350> do
