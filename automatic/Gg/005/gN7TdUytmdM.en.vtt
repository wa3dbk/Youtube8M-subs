 I just want to see it 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 ask how will that be 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.390
 weather on week on saturday it should rain 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.909
 give the temperature reached 18 degrees 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.349
 but also ask how it's raining today 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:30.340
 weather forecast reports at temperatures 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.060
 between 15 and 25 degrees show that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.099
 weather 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.980

 turn on music to play notes 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.090
 to take someone on the smartphone 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.609
 to call or to address a sms 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.560
 or even request flights 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.890
 every now and then it comes 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.900
 in front of the portal only google brings 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 who does not use his calculator once 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.920
 it does not have to be from now on 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.950
 but can practice more in the head 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.359
 in most cases, for example with what it 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.139

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.530

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.169
