some of the approaches that we're taking

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.580 
some of the approaches that we're taking
as<00:00:15.089> well<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> arsenal<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.440> our

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
as well as some of the arsenal at our

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760 
as well as some of the arsenal at our
disposal<00:00:17.220> at<00:00:17.690> MedImmune<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.050> allows<00:00:19.260> us<00:00:19.289> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
disposal at MedImmune that allows us to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.509

use<00:00:20.250> antibodies<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.240> therapeutics<00:00:22.279> I'll<00:00:23.279> also

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
use antibodies as therapeutics I'll also

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.519 
use antibodies as therapeutics I'll also
tell<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.840> approaches<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.289> we're

tell you about the approaches that we're

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
tell you about the approaches that we're
taking<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.070> involved<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:27.000> only<00:00:27.240> trying<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
taking that involved not only trying to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.839 
taking that involved not only trying to
find<00:00:27.630> new<00:00:28.380> targets<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:28.890> cancer<00:00:29.130> stem<00:00:29.490> cells

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
find new targets for cancer stem cells

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.659 
find new targets for cancer stem cells
but<00:00:30.539> also<00:00:30.869> test<00:00:31.199> some<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> our<00:00:31.769> current<00:00:32.070> agents

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
but also test some of our current agents

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.569 
but also test some of our current agents
for<00:00:32.880> cancer<00:00:33.210> stem<00:00:33.420> cell<00:00:33.719> activity<00:00:34.489> there<00:00:35.489> are

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
for cancer stem cell activity there are

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
for cancer stem cell activity there are
still<00:00:35.790> quite<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> few<00:00:36.210> challenges<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
still quite a few challenges in this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
still quite a few challenges in this

questions that have also been raised by
some<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> other<00:00:43.559> speakers<00:00:43.890> that

represent some of the challenges that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
represent some of the challenges that
we're<00:00:45.899> still<00:00:46.079> facing<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.770> developing<00:00:47.489> drugs

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
we're still facing in developing drugs

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.680 
we're still facing in developing drugs
against<00:00:48.149> cancer<00:00:48.660> stem<00:00:48.840> cells<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> previous

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
against cancer stem cells so previous

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.470 
against cancer stem cells so previous
speakers<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.140> already<00:00:52.770> told<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
speakers have already told you about the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
speakers have already told you about the
properties<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> cancer<00:00:55.350> stem<00:00:55.530> cells<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
properties of cancer stem cells so I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
properties of cancer stem cells so I
will<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.430> belabor<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.210> slide<00:00:57.510> however<00:00:58.320> one

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
will not belabor this slide however one

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
will not belabor this slide however one
thing<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.190> point<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.699> because<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> think

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
thing I will point out because I think

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760 
thing I will point out because I think
it<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.750> important<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it will be important in some of the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670 
it will be important in some of the
subsequent<00:01:02.430> slides<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.409> drug

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
subsequent slides is that the drug

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
subsequent slides is that the drug
resistance<00:01:05.250> properties<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.939> cancer<00:01:06.299> stem

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
resistance properties of cancer stem

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
resistance properties of cancer stem
cells<00:01:06.840> means<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.369> treat<00:01:08.640> with

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
cells means that when you treat with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
cells means that when you treat with
some<00:01:09.119> chemo<00:01:09.450> therapeutic<00:01:09.840> agents<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
some chemo therapeutic agents you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
some chemo therapeutic agents you
actually<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.430> proportion<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> increase

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
actually see a proportion that increase

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
actually see a proportion that increase
our<00:01:13.020> enrichment<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.799> cancer<00:01:14.460> stem<00:01:14.610> cells<00:01:14.939> in

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
our enrichment in cancer stem cells in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.510 
our enrichment in cancer stem cells in
the<00:01:15.270> tumor<00:01:15.509> population<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the tumor population and again this is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600 
the tumor population and again this is
representative<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.159> chemo<00:01:20.159> therapeutic

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
representative of the chemo therapeutic

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
representative of the chemo therapeutic
resistance<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.140> cancer<00:01:22.560> stem

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
resistance that we see in cancer stem

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.710 
resistance that we see in cancer stem
cells<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.640> course<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
cells and of course is one of the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600 
cells and of course is one of the
reasons<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.350> we're<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.009> interested<00:01:26.520> in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
reasons that we're so interested in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
reasons that we're so interested in
targeting<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.330> population<00:01:27.869> since<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
targeting this population since they

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
targeting this population since they
appear<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.549> responsible<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.360> relapse<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
appear to be responsible for relapse and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.149 
appear to be responsible for relapse and
recurrence<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> dr.<00:01:34.259> Frank<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.560> also<00:01:34.860> taking

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
recurrence so dr. Frank is also taking

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
recurrence so dr. Frank is also taking
you<00:01:35.250> through<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> slide<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> I'll<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.390> not

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you through this slide so I'll also not

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.560 
you through this slide so I'll also not
belabor<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.880> very

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
