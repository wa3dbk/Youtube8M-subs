okay<00:01:38.160> now<00:01:38.370> this<00:01:38.640> flare<00:01:39.120> up<00:01:39.330> as<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.410> result<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
okay now this flare up as a result of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.390 
okay now this flare up as a result of
not<00:01:42.150> having<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.630> burner<00:01:42.840> bail<00:01:43.160> really<00:01:44.160> hot

not having the burner bail really hot

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.670 
not having the burner bail really hot
enough<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.010> squirt<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> gasoline

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
enough so I get is a squirt of gasoline

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.030 
enough so I get is a squirt of gasoline
raw<00:01:49.680> gas<00:01:50.270> out<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.570> stove<00:01:53.150> before<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.800> bill

raw gas out of the stove before the bill
is<00:01:56.400> hot<00:01:56.670> enough<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.690> vaporize<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.700> don't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
is hot enough to vaporize it I don't

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.000 
is hot enough to vaporize it I don't
want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.940> burn<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:01.050> anything<00:02:01.320> else<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.890> I'll

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
want to burn up anything else so I'll

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.890 
want to burn up anything else so I'll
turn<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.400> down<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:02.970> bill<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.270> hot<00:02:03.630> we'll

turn it down now the bill is hot we'll

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.920 
turn it down now the bill is hot we'll
try<00:02:04.410> again<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:09.600> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.120 

now<00:02:12.930> once<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.500> Bell<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:14.490> hot<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.560> gasoline

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
now once the Bell is hot and gasoline

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.070 
now once the Bell is hot and gasoline
sprays<00:02:17.730> right<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.140> tank

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.160 

let's<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:30.170> 71

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
let's see what we can do with the 71

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.280 
let's see what we can do with the 71
over<00:02:31.350> here<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:32.120> had<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.540> preheated<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
over here I had it up preheated and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
over here I had it up preheated and
running<00:02:34.650> earlier<00:02:34.980> we'll<00:02:35.910> see<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.450> just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
running earlier we'll see if it just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:49.050 
running earlier we'll see if it just
jumps<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.530> life

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.240 

it<00:02:49.270> needs<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.810> little<00:02:49.959> bit<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.230> preheating<00:02:50.920> get

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it needs a little bit of preheating get

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.940 
it needs a little bit of preheating get
the<00:02:51.370> bail<00:02:51.580> hot

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.630 

it's<00:02:54.310> easy<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.760> see<00:02:55.000> why<00:02:55.210> these<00:02:55.630> souls<00:02:56.020> were

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's easy to see why these souls were

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.070 
it's easy to see why these souls were
replaced<00:02:57.640> by<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:57.970> modern<00:03:00.030> butane<00:03:01.030> so

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
replaced by the modern butane so

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.020 
replaced by the modern butane so
trying<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.290> do<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.940> a

we're a long learning curve

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.250 
we're a long learning curve
that's<00:05:14.790> important<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.690> could<00:05:15.840> take<00:05:16.050> out

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
that's important so you could take out

that's important so you could take out
on<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.680> first<00:05:16.920> time<00:05:17.160> on<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> trip

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
I got a problem with the Silvani end

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.580 
I got a problem with the Silvani end
the<00:05:29.680> burner<00:05:30.680> is<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.070> slightly<00:05:31.670> block

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
the burner is a slightly block

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.120 
the burner is a slightly block
and<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.160> jet<00:05:34.570> needs<00:05:35.570> to<00:05:35.780> be<00:05:35.930> cleared<00:05:36.290> out<00:05:36.500> I'm

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
and the jet needs to be cleared out I'm

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.320 
and the jet needs to be cleared out I'm
not<00:05:37.310> going<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.550> do<00:05:37.640> that<00:05:37.820> right<00:05:38.060> here<00:05:38.270> right

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
not going to do that right here right

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.810 
not going to do that right here right
now<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.800> would<00:05:39.890> have<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.220> have<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.400> tool

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
now but you would have to have a tool

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.420 
now but you would have to have a tool
like<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:41.180> along<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:42.890> have<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.220> take

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
like this along and you have to take

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.360 
like this along and you have to take
that<00:05:43.610> tiny<00:05:43.880> wire<00:05:44.230> on<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.590> end<00:05:45.740> of<00:05:45.890> this<00:05:46.040> tool

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
that tiny wire on the end of this tool

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.710 
that tiny wire on the end of this tool
and<00:05:46.780> put<00:05:47.780> it<00:05:47.900> in<00:05:48.050> as<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.290> jet<00:05:48.560> to<00:05:48.710> clear<00:05:49.010> it

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
and put it in as a jet to clear it

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.530 
and put it in as a jet to clear it
it<00:05:51.230> would<00:05:51.380> be<00:05:51.500> another<00:05:51.800> hassle

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
it would be another hassle

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.660 
it would be another hassle
so<00:05:53.750> that's<00:05:54.140> why<00:05:54.350> they<00:05:54.530> went<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:55.070> butane

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
so that's why they went to the butane

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.450 
so that's why they went to the butane
stove<00:05:56.170> though<00:05:57.170> he<00:05:57.290> has<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.590> do<00:05:57.710> is<00:05:57.920> turn<00:05:58.130> it<00:05:58.280> on

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
stove though he has to do is turn it on

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.700 
stove though he has to do is turn it on
and<00:05:58.640> light<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:59.000> you<00:05:59.930> wouldn't<00:06:00.170> have<00:06:00.290> to<00:06:00.470> fool

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
and light it you wouldn't have to fool

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.740 
and light it you wouldn't have to fool
around<00:06:01.000> clearing<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.060> black<00:06:02.330> jet<00:06:02.690> with<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:02.900> cool

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.140
