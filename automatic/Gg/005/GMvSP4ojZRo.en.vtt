okay<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.939> part<00:00:02.939> 2<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.480> Sam<00:00:03.840> Lex<00:00:04.049> power

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay this is part 2 of the Sam Lex power

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.670 
okay this is part 2 of the Sam Lex power
inverter<00:00:04.680> repair<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:06.170> started<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.290> dig<00:00:07.470> into

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
inverter repair and started to dig into

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280 
inverter repair and started to dig into
it<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> little<00:00:08.250> bit<00:00:08.429> more<00:00:08.660> I'm<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.110> order

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
it a little bit more I'm about to order

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.280 
it a little bit more I'm about to order
the<00:00:10.500> parts<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:11.639> notice<00:00:12.389> some<00:00:12.599> stuff<00:00:12.960> here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
the parts but notice some stuff here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.310 
the parts but notice some stuff here
that<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:14.009> concerning<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.730> now<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.199> had

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that was concerning me now as I had

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.700 
that was concerning me now as I had
mentioned<00:00:16.500> before<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.710> Prevention

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
mentioned before the and Prevention

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.960 
mentioned before the and Prevention
trying<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.100> rid<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> glare<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.820> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
trying to get rid of the glare here I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
trying to get rid of the glare here I
took<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.020> 30<00:00:22.260> amp<00:00:22.439> fuses<00:00:22.890> there's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
took out all the 30 amp fuses there's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.000 
took out all the 30 amp fuses there's
ten<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> them<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.410> they<00:00:25.410> protect<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
ten of them and they protect the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.160 
ten of them and they protect the
transformers<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> capacitors<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:27.930> are

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
transformers and the capacitors that are

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630 
transformers and the capacitors that are
associated<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
associated with it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.709 
associated with it
but<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.390> found<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.300> measured<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
but I found that the when I measured the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
but I found that the when I measured the
resistance<00:00:34.260> between<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.890> positive<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
resistance between the positive and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.000 
resistance between the positive and
negative<00:00:35.790> terminals<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.559> seeing<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
negative terminals here I was seeing a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
negative terminals here I was seeing a
dead<00:00:38.219> short<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.140> six

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
dead short it's about it was about six

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.299 
dead short it's about it was about six
ohms<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.719> but<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:43.020> decided<00:00:43.649> okay<00:00:44.100> well

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
ohms or so but I've decided okay well

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
ohms or so but I've decided okay well
it's<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> fuses<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it's got to be one of the fuses that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.040 
it's got to be one of the fuses that
popped<00:00:46.430> if<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.730> shorted<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
popped if it's shorted out like that and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
popped if it's shorted out like that and
obviously<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
obviously we see if we here with the you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.639 
obviously we see if we here with the you
know<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> FET<00:00:52.350> being<00:00:52.649> burned<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> crisp<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
know the FET being burned to a crisp and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
know the FET being burned to a crisp and
unfortunately<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.920> can't<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.460> put<00:00:56.789> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
unfortunately you can't just put your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080 
unfortunately you can't just put your
leads<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.510> each<00:00:57.899> side<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.710> fuse<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.789> if

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
leads on each side of the fuse to see if

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.959 
leads on each side of the fuse to see if
it's<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:02.430> each<00:01:02.640> share

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's good or not because they each share

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.109 
it's good or not because they each share
the<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.390> bus<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.729> what<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> found

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the same bus right here and what I found

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.500 
the same bus right here and what I found
was<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> ten<00:01:07.110> fuses<00:01:07.939> six<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.270> had

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
was out of the ten fuses six of them had

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
was out of the ten fuses six of them had
failed<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.590> four<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.670> were<00:01:11.820> still<00:01:12.060> good

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
failed and four of them were still good

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.590 
failed and four of them were still good
now<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.890> their<00:01:14.549> 180<00:01:15.180> amps<00:01:15.540> right

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
now that's about their 180 amps right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
now that's about their 180 amps right
there<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.590> imagine<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> reason

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there I would imagine that the reason

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
there I would imagine that the reason
why<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.600> didn't<00:01:19.229> fail<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> same

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
why they all didn't fail at the same

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
why they all didn't fail at the same
time<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.479> user<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:23.600> had<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> fuse<00:01:24.990> inline

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
time if the user had a had a fuse inline

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
time if the user had a had a fuse inline
fuse<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> positive<00:01:26.610> rail<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
fuse on the positive rail here I'm

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.950 
fuse on the positive rail here I'm
thinking<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.229> fuse<00:01:28.560> would<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.950> popped

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
thinking that fuse would have popped

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
thinking that fuse would have popped
included<00:01:30.960> before<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:31.979> able<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> take<00:01:32.640> all

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
included before it was able to take all

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780 
included before it was able to take all
of<00:01:32.939> these<00:01:33.180> fuses<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> pretty

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
of these fuses out so there was a pretty

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.429 
of these fuses out so there was a pretty
large<00:01:36.030> overload<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> happened<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.290> when

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
large overload that happened there when

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
large overload that happened there when
this<00:01:37.560> transistor<00:01:37.979> FET<00:01:38.820> failed<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> testing<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
this transistor FET failed so testing it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
this transistor FET failed so testing it
even<00:01:43.470> though<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.280> hair

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
even though that some of these hair

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
even though that some of these hair
don't<00:01:45.119> look<00:01:45.329> burned<00:01:45.630> they're<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.710> much

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
don't look burned they're pretty much

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.609 
don't look burned they're pretty much
the<00:01:47.040> entire<00:01:47.369> input<00:01:47.670> FET<00:01:48.479> section<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> shorted

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the entire input FET section is shorted

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.069 
the entire input FET section is shorted
out<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.270> replaced

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
out all these need to be replaced

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.380 
out all these need to be replaced
all<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.820> replaced<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.360> well

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
all of these need to be replaced as well

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.539 
all of these need to be replaced as well
the<00:01:55.909> diodes<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.119> test<00:01:57.540> okay<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.460> know

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the diodes here test okay but you know

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910 
the diodes here test okay but you know
for<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.329> 30<00:02:00.540> cents<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.740> worth

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
for the 30 cents or so it's worth

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
for the 30 cents or so it's worth
changing<00:02:02.219> these<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> output

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
changing these for now the output

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
changing these for now the output
section<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.700> where<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.180> gets<00:02:06.360> tricky

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
section this is where it gets tricky

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.350 
section this is where it gets tricky
because<00:02:06.860> these<00:02:07.860> tests<00:02:08.459> okay<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
because these tests okay these are the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
because these tests okay these are the
output<00:02:09.720> transistors<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> AC<00:02:10.770> outlet

getting about a you know couple mega
ohms<00:02:21.910> resistance<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:22.930> which<00:02:23.110> tells<00:02:23.380> me

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
ohms resistance there which tells me

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.220 
ohms resistance there which tells me
that<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.160> output<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.820> ac<00:02:25.270> section<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:26.050> not

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
that the output a ac section is not

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.310 
that the output a ac section is not
burnt<00:02:26.710> out<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.910> does<00:02:28.180> not<00:02:28.210> tell<00:02:28.780> me<00:02:29.080> that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
burnt out but that does not tell me that

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.010 
burnt out but that does not tell me that
the<00:02:30.010> drive<00:02:30.250> circuitry<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.210> still<00:02:31.540> good<00:02:31.750> when

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the drive circuitry is still good when

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.950 
the drive circuitry is still good when
the<00:02:32.200> input<00:02:32.560> section<00:02:33.010> goes<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:34.150> spike<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
the input section goes that spike and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.290 
the input section goes that spike and
the<00:02:35.230> overload<00:02:35.650> could<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.130> damaged<00:02:37.030> either

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
the overload could have damaged either

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.870 
the overload could have damaged either
of<00:02:37.600> these<00:02:38.010> boards<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:39.310> here's<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.640> one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
of these boards are there here's the one

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.850 
of these boards are there here's the one
for<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.090> low<00:02:40.240> voltage<00:02:40.390> alarm<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.560> one

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
for the low voltage alarm this is one

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.790 
for the low voltage alarm this is one
for<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.160> features<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.660> think<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:44.710> I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
for the features of I think because I

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.500 
for the features of I think because I
think<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.130> model<00:02:45.580> comes<00:02:45.910> with<00:02:46.030> yeah<00:02:46.420> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
think this model comes with yeah it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.210 
think this model comes with yeah it
comes<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:47.980> see<00:02:48.130> how

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
comes with this and then you can see how

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.740 
comes with this and then you can see how
much<00:02:48.400> power<00:02:48.670> if<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.090> tells<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.510> it's<00:02:49.630> an

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
much power if it tells you if it's an

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.170 
much power if it tells you if it's an
inch<00:02:49.900> input<00:02:50.470> fault<00:02:51.100> or<00:02:51.400> an<00:02:51.490> output<00:02:51.760> fault<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
inch input fault or an output fault and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.600 
inch input fault or an output fault and
then<00:02:52.300> your<00:02:52.420> input<00:02:52.840> battery<00:02:53.470> voltage<00:02:53.920> is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
then your input battery voltage is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.350 
then your input battery voltage is
monitored<00:02:55.180> here<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.610> pretty<00:02:58.210> good

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
monitored here and I have pretty good

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.350 
monitored here and I have pretty good
suspicion<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.110> this<00:02:59.710> board<00:03:00.100> had<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.090> what

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
suspicion that this board had is what

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.030 
suspicion that this board had is what
controls<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:02.440> there's<00:03:02.590> some<00:03:02.770> trace

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
controls that because there's some trace

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160 
controls that because there's some trace
between<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.610> cap<00:03:03.790> 45<00:03:04.360> where<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.720> plugs<00:03:04.960> into

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
between the cap 45 where that plugs into

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.520 
between the cap 45 where that plugs into
that<00:03:05.890> goes<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.370> board<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.380> you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
that goes to this board so this if you

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.700 
that goes to this board so this if you
split<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.040> half<00:03:09.930> half<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.320> is<00:03:11.440> doing

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
split it in half half of it is doing

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.440 
split it in half half of it is doing
that<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.340> drive<00:03:12.550> circuitry<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.300> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that is the drive circuitry for the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.900 
that is the drive circuitry for the
input<00:03:13.810> stage<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.440> then<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.130> other<00:03:15.310> half<00:03:15.640> is

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
input stage and then the other half is

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.620 
input stage and then the other half is
the<00:03:15.970> drive<00:03:16.900> circuitry<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.860> run<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.550> output<00:03:18.880> AC

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the drive circuitry to run the output AC

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.260 
the drive circuitry to run the output AC
section<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.920> now<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.160> problem<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.030> if

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
section so now the problem is that if

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.930 
section so now the problem is that if
this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.720> busted<00:03:23.170> then<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.400> know<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.640> amount

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
this is busted then you know the amount

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.160 
this is busted then you know the amount
of<00:03:25.030> money<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.390> you're<00:03:25.570> going<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.750> spend<00:03:25.990> with

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
of money that you're going to spend with

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.250 
of money that you're going to spend with
parts<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.460> input<00:03:27.820> section<00:03:28.060> this<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.990> not

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
parts on the input section this is not

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.040 
parts on the input section this is not
as<00:03:29.440> easily<00:03:29.650> repairable<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.640> do<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.780> part

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
as easily repairable I do see the part

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.280 
as easily repairable I do see the part
numbers<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.620> ICS<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.840> when<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.930> see<00:03:35.140> the

de little diodes here and let's see if I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.310 
de little diodes here and let's see if I
can<00:03:37.390> try<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.750> get<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:39.960> into<00:03:40.960> this<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.110> little

can try and get in into this a little
bit<00:03:41.530> closer<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:43.450> see<00:03:43.660> some<00:03:43.900> surface<00:03:44.350> mount

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
bit closer you see some surface mount

of<00:03:57.850> those<00:03:57.940> are<00:03:58.150> pops<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.630> don't<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:59.050> if<00:03:59.500> I'd<00:03:59.830> be

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
of those are pops I don't know if I'd be

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.120 
of those are pops I don't know if I'd be
able<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.190> get<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> exact<00:04:00.960> replacement<00:04:01.960> but<00:04:02.920> at

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
able to get the exact replacement but at

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.630 
able to get the exact replacement but at
least<00:04:03.250> with<00:04:03.490> these<00:04:03.610> chips<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.150> could<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.400> it's<00:04:06.550> a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
least with these chips I could so it's a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.180 
least with these chips I could so it's a
little<00:04:06.790> bit<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.210> gamble<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:08.110> know<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.860> the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
little bit of a gamble I know that I the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.800 
little bit of a gamble I know that I the
only<00:04:09.370> way<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.640> really<00:04:09.850> test<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.390> output

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
only way to really test the output

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.230 
only way to really test the output
section<00:04:11.050> here<00:04:11.620> is<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:12.340> get<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.640> input<00:04:12.820> section

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
section here is to get the input section

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.750 
section here is to get the input section
running<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:15.070> then<00:04:15.250> once<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.640> input

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
running to and then once the input

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.460 
running to and then once the input
section<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.359> running<00:04:16.630> if<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.989> if<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.170> powers

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
section is running if and if it powers

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.280 
section is running if and if it powers
up<00:04:17.650> great<00:04:18.040> if<00:04:18.280> not<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.910> know<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.930> amount<00:04:20.200> of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
up great if not you know the amount of

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.890 
up great if not you know the amount of
time<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.460> parts<00:04:21.850> you're<00:04:22.390> almost<00:04:22.540> looking

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
time in the parts you're almost looking

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.990 
time in the parts you're almost looking
at<00:04:23.050> about<00:04:23.260> half<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.950> cost<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.550> inverter

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
at about half the cost of this inverter

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.790 
at about half the cost of this inverter
and<00:04:25.270> then

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
and then

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.450 
and then
that<00:04:26.039> point<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.610> really<00:04:26.879> worth<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.310> this

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
that point is it really worth it so this

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490 
that point is it really worth it so this
is<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.909> to<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.509> be<00:04:33.690> continued<00:04:34.229> for<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
is going to be to be continued for the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980 
is going to be to be continued for the
next<00:04:34.620> part<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.460> I'll<00:04:36.449> let<00:04:36.659> you<00:04:36.780> guys<00:04:36.960> know

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
next part and I'll let you guys know

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.700 
next part and I'll let you guys know
when<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:38.509> get<00:04:39.509> some<00:04:39.780> parts<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.349> hopefully

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
when I get some parts in to hopefully

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.240 
when I get some parts in to hopefully
try<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.190> give<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> shot<00:04:41.610> at<00:04:41.729> repairing<00:04:42.060> this
