00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.590 

hi<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.350> Mary<00:00:04.650> Chan<00:00:05.069> soo<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.640> you're<00:00:06.000> here<00:00:06.330> in

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hi I'm Mary Chan soo and you're here in

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.530 
hi I'm Mary Chan soo and you're here in
our<00:00:06.870> studio<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.230> London<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.980> think<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> way<00:00:09.300> my

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
our studio in London I think the way my

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.930 
our studio in London I think the way my
work<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.769> built

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
work is built

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.370 
work is built
it's<00:00:12.300> very<00:00:12.509> symmetrical<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.170> there's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
it's very symmetrical and there's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.499 
it's very symmetrical and there's
certain<00:00:13.740> buttons<00:00:14.130> because<00:00:14.849> they<00:00:14.880> engineer<00:00:15.360> my

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
certain buttons because they engineer my

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.150 
certain buttons because they engineer my
present<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.320> they're<00:00:16.800> doing<00:00:16.980> it

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
present because they're doing it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.720 
present because they're doing it
engineered<00:00:17.940> around<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.420> woman<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
engineered around the woman and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.679 
engineered around the woman and
essentially<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:20.880> creating<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.359> second

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
essentially you're creating a second

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.240 
essentially you're creating a second
skin<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> woman<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:22.890> there's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
skin for the woman so I think there's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
skin for the woman so I think there's
something<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.330> mean<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.350> integral<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
something very I mean it's integral to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
something very I mean it's integral to
both<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> symmetry<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> balance<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
both the symmetry and the balance of the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
both the symmetry and the balance of the
way<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> built<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.800> happen<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.429> there's

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
way you built it happen because there's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
way you built it happen because there's
so<00:00:29.910> many<00:00:30.029> components<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> way<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.320> feel

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so many components in a way I feel

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
so many components in a way I feel
sometimes<00:00:32.600> every<00:00:33.600> season<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.230> guest

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
sometimes every season that I'm guest

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
sometimes every season that I'm guest
designing<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> collection<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
designing a collection me that a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
designing a collection me that a
collection<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> perfume<00:00:37.440> bottles<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.040> blown

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
collection of perfume bottles or blown

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.080 
collection of perfume bottles or blown
glass<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:39.890> interiors<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:41.910> bit

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
glass or interiors so it's a little bit

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
glass or interiors so it's a little bit
different<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> inspiration<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:43.920> if

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
different I think the inspiration for if

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.360 
different I think the inspiration for if
I<00:00:44.129> start<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.270> built<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.370> other

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I start with how I built it up to other

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.180 
I start with how I built it up to other
fashion<00:00:47.910> designers<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:48.739> part<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.980> my

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fashion designers and I think part of my

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
fashion designers and I think part of my
education<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.910> architecture<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.690> has

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
education in architecture I think has

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
education in architecture I think has
influenced<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.770> bit<00:00:52.920> even<00:00:53.280> though

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
influenced that a little bit even though

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.560 
influenced that a little bit even though
it<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.579> very<00:00:53.610> short<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.239> I've<00:00:54.390> only

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it was very short because I've only

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
it was very short because I've only
really<00:00:55.170> studied<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> year<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> architecture<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
really studied a year in architecture I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
really studied a year in architecture I
think<00:00:56.730> there's<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> elements<00:00:58.010> all

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
think there's a lot of elements all

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
think there's a lot of elements all
right<00:00:59.629> this<00:01:00.629> isn't<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> dual<00:01:01.379> theme<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
right this isn't it's a dual theme and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
right this isn't it's a dual theme and
the<00:01:02.010> idea<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.460> would<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.149> journey

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the idea was that would be a journey

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
the idea was that would be a journey
from<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:04.049> into<00:01:04.379> another<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.060> which<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.299> quite

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
from one into another and which is quite

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
from one into another and which is quite
ambitious<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.710> found<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.189> because<00:01:08.520> it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
ambitious I found out because it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
ambitious I found out because it's
almost<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.270> working<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.630> two

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
almost like you're working with two

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.859 
almost like you're working with two
friends<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.350> print<00:01:10.799> our<00:01:10.950> Ainslie<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.760> um<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
friends and I print our Ainslie so um I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
friends and I print our Ainslie so um I
think<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> could<00:01:14.850> say<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
think like what I could say is that it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
think like what I could say is that it's
very<00:01:15.479> contrasted<00:01:16.369> one<00:01:17.369> part<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
very contrasted one part is the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
very contrasted one part is the
industrial<00:01:19.110> fabrication<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.009> find<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
industrial fabrication that we find a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179 
industrial fabrication that we find a
gutter<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.900> steel<00:01:22.409> formation<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
gutter is the steel formation that you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.240 
gutter is the steel formation that you
get<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> nature<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> went<00:01:25.229> into<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.590> MA<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
get in nature when I went into my MA and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
get in nature when I went into my MA and
decided<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.180> fashion<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.720> was

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
decided I want to do fashion there was

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
decided I want to do fashion there was
we<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> fashion<00:01:28.619> capital<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
we know how to fashion capital that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
we know how to fashion capital that
would<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.939> able<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> support<00:01:30.329> me<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.810> London

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
would be able to support me as London

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
would be able to support me as London
did<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> industries<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
did and you know the industries and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
did and you know the industries and
industry<00:01:34.380> has<00:01:34.560> such<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> great<00:01:35.100> platform<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
industry has such a great platform to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
industry has such a great platform to
show<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.990> work<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.380> such<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.799> area<00:01:37.950> states

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
show your work in such an area states

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
show your work in such an area states
that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.570> soon<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.960> graduated<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that I think as soon as I graduated I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
that I think as soon as I graduated I
was<00:01:40.740> given<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> opportunity<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.820> an<00:01:42.150> EJ

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
was given the opportunity to do an EJ

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.310 
was given the opportunity to do an EJ
and<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.220> decided<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.360> build<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and from then I decided to build up the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.800 
and from then I decided to build up the
company

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
company
