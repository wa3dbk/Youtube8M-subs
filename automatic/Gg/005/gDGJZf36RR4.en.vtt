00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 this is hello then today I 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 you were talking about what ben actually he 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.199
 I happened a little by little 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.660
 with the hp laptop that you see there 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.170
 that is, in fact I have everything 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.050
 simply 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 so in fact had a problem with 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.260
 supply 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.890
 that's what apparently happens not bad 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.960
 so in fact this is not happening 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 badly in the dear sir hp 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 why because that's just 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.430
 that's the plug and it's a plug 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.149
 right with I fart naughty a son 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.850
 pretty soft and fat is not terrible 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 that's with more cards in the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 kind of his daughters it's the big one 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.579
 plug with earth ground that is not used for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.379
 great thing since so in fact there's no 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 the metal parts on so 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.770
 feeding so I do not see too much 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 benefit it then there you have a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 feeding so he does everything 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.479
 just 60 kg so that actually makes 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.080
 65 watts 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.740
 that's 19 volts and I needed a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 change so this diet 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.909
 that's so is actually I went on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 something pretty nice is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.259
 from Mr. Energizer 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.200
 this is a diet that is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.470
 ultra slim so 90 watts 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.250
 so I was doing 65 this is 90 by 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.049
 what benefit then more from this 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.430
 diet is that simply 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.200
 she is very fine 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.170
 so in fact the case is very thin 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 appreciable enough was seeing so is in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 do they multibrand 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 so in fact that's if it's well 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.439
 trick you actually have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 acer asus hp lenovo dell toshiba and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.649
 samsung 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.250
 so that's how diet they 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 introduce themselves 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.149
 Ben's here see so actually allies 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.170
 it's very very very very very very very hungry 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.860
 this is still relatively 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.409
 nice 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 so if I cry as parent to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.110
 the other 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.380
 so see that it's nothing to do 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.060
 yes, that's so it's down so it's 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.710
 the new one of dios and the old one 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.570
 sanyo is so down is more 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.520
 thick and therefore practically the same 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.080
 cut 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.270
 so what made me laugh in 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.190
 the story is that the new model 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.080
 finally the model so in fact the du 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.870
 new manufacturer who therefore manufactures 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.300
 does some combative feeding 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.860
 with all the laptops I've got you 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.330
 quoted the marks and b so in fact actually 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 a much more fun diet 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.840
 so the other thing is also who 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.090
 is nice enough 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's the cable the cable is a lot 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.760
 less fat 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.010
 so in fact much less rigid and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.600
 it's a standard socket that gets 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.950
 as much in the earth as in 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.580
 the normal catches and it got 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.070
 relatively friendly not second 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.610
 super nice thing it is at the level 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.830
 so in fact of the plug this is the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.110
 plug turn in all directions and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.850
 listen to what allows less breakage 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.380
 and by one compared to a form that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.590
 is completely right here and who 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.190
 are waiting below so in fact move 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.900
 like these at the end broken and 3rd 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.030
 super nice things is it is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 multi voltage it is this power supply 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.690
 is multi voltage so it fits 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 more or less all laptops 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.150
 in fact in the brands I have you 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.870
 chosen and here so you actually 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 following the adapters so you have 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.720
 so for all notebooks 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.660
 which I have near you which I have you 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.640
 given the marks just now and then 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.410
 there the adapter just enough to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.260
 the en-v of his support is to go the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.120
 connect here on this part here it is 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 and so to you there after 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.920
 directly into your mobile 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.680
 that's when I found myself friendly 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.670
 frankly 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:05.409
 and so in fact that's 90 watts 1 meter 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.599
 80 so between here and the laptop 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.900
 So there is still not a bad 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.409
 very food so actually we are 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.760
 very fine not very big and the 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.070
 presentation it's a link in the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.900
 eleven years of 90 watt assignment this 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.489
 who does compared to one of 65 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.289
 ie that there just now so 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.419
 she was bigger so here it is 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.979
 feeding and she was doing 65 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.840
 this one makes 90 advantage is that 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.000
 is offered to me when the computer in 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.990
 load compared to the old one so he 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.639
 always have to take a 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.810
 increase your mobile when 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.639
 you change the reporting ratings 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.979
 that it must always be equal or 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.099
 greater than the number of watts your 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.229
 so initial feeding and it takes 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.270
 always respect the same voltage 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.610
 that was not me 19 volts for a 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.690
 notebook that only accept cese that 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.130
 would make him fart here that's actually that I 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.490
 will buy so in fact in a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.960
 good store knowing that's called 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.560
 electrodeposit simply without doing 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.870
 advertising 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.330
 knowing you find that around 30 35 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.370
 euros a little bit everywhere and in addition 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.139
 a note is that the brand is born 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.139
 energizer here
