00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hi, I'm Diego Cardenas. I'm a designer 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.480
 industrial and we are doing bicycles 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.480
 bamboo 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.750
 yesterday increased bamboo and I learned to 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.100
 work with bamboo as Japanese 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.870
 and the workshop because it really helped me 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.790
 as to know the material know that 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:44.140
 there was bamboo generates 30% more oxygen 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.140
 that a normal tree 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 It was very original to me to have your 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.159
 own list of bamboo created with its 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 own hands 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:02.059
 it's very important and ideally you see that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.059
 this recycled material that bamboo does not 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.229
 there are bicycles that are only the fiber of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.880
 carbon this is bamboo that is super 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.189
 strong more carbon fiber then 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.360
 you're talking a pretty bicycle 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 very light strong resistant 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 muffles a lot the vibration of the street 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.789
 then it is a more comfortable bicycle than 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 any other discreet current social and 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.149
 Normally when you use a bike always 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 it takes the same thing to arrive then 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.590
 there is also an advantage 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.409
 Well, I think that what the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.560
 city is a little more infrastructure 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.810
 but above all education have more 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.729
 awareness that not only is it one among 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.649
 a car but there are other people 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.649
 that you have to take care of and you have to respect 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 if I think that the beginning of how 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.659
 doing it makes me want the most 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.409
 ask for 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.869
 at three years 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.130
 and I have experienced everything for me 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.130
 It has been learning to flow 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.430
 be in harmony with others 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.739
 in terms of applications they use a lot 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.230
 to one that is called ways for traffic 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.609
 I also use an action to estrada by 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 example for the workshop to give 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.329
 diffusion I use a lot of instagram to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.879
 Take photos upload them on social networks 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.879
 facebook also twitter 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.490
 Well, from experience what 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.380
 only one that can make you recommend the 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.720
 move within the city with 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.940
 bicycle and I invite you also to 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.220
 know the bamboo website 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.380
 Cycles know the bicycles know 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.240
 the processes are integrated more on the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.980
 activities we do and are encouraged to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.030
 come and take a workshop and do your 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 own mushroom bike
