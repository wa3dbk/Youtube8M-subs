00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.910
 hello dear friends back today i 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 I want to show you Osterglocken how 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.980
 you inject it with the one syringe 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.970
 Glaze, we need our flowers 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.879
 nail covered with an aluminum foil 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:44.570
 is and have special tools though 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 We Thüle a vision here a molded 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.390
 So separating a bow 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.150
 that is a great wealth of this kind 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 from the quiet guy and I have then 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.760
 even to decorate the small one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.430
 We need them too 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.869
 then we need one better 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 potato starch or cornstarch 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.890
 you 'll see why soon 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 We'll start with the leaves now 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 the leaves and it is quite whole 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.910
 important that she says that sprit 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.650
 her fuel say keeps about 45 degrees 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.040
 not so much but really a bit 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:36.330
 This is very easy 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 we pressure and the rest always away 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.570
 because the french otherwise 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.380
 leaves are so frayed out and that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:02.140
 we do not want and how it turns 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:05.890
 I position the brand to flowers but now 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 another sheet is the last sheet 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:17.709
 always the hardest i said to you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 off and now we are doing a stand 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.390
 I also have Stenzel with one 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:30.940
 flower bag I have also yellow 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:37.360
 icing we make one here now 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 round circle what I now lord 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.840
 work with these movements 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:59.920
 so is still the tip of the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.390
 tips and that's what I have 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.520
 said one needs a strength so far 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.400
 because otherwise we have the sugar here 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.600
 gluten protein cling to the fingers 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.020
 stay 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.739
 are now and that should please now 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.630
 at least five to ten minutes 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.180
 dry up because it comes around here again 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.959
 a huge party listen to it and if we 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 then this would inject immediately 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.830
 that sink in and it would not be good 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.500
 ausschauen 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.300
 So that is very important in the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.959
 Osterglocken there you have a bit 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.820
 waiting 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.330
 but you inject yourself today 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.790
 then you make a series before and at the end 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.560
 The Russians bordure once again 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.550
 about it 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.940
 the wrong he is so i tell you that 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.940
 once again 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:05.810
 start turning and always the nozzle 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.810
 arrange 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.609
 These flowers are really great 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:22.459
 decorative of spring for easter for 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.459
 a cake for mother's day 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:38.340
 I really like her very much 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:49.710
 so easy thumb and index finger in the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:52.560
 you need strength and you are once again 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 can not keep it that way either 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.120
 How can you be so sharp with your hand 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.510
 or directly where it says it 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.260
 By the way, a coated is the 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.260
 robo so if you do it yourself 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.150
 You can also be dry 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:18.300
 already take it and put it into it 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.860
 This pet-op piece polystyrene has 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.530
 fast home 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.300
 yes and it was as I said five to ten 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.250
 minutes if then it goes on with the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.400
 russians 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.430
 we're back that's a good five 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.690
 Minutes passed and it still matters to me 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.199
 the decorate the ruffles practically 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.960
 on the red circle like i said before 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.590
 We also have a place for 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.229
 a small giant thüle the smallest 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.330
 and we need that for now 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:06:04.849
 We take this step now 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.849
 our flower and start with one 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.840
 this zig zag movement 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.330
 2 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:40.230
 and you can if you want 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.760
 so stamp in it 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.550
 You can get that at tinkering shops 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.460
 does not necessarily have to be 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:55.410
 give again a swab of 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:07:07.710
 yellow in and just put this 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:11.640
 stamp here on the rhine so you can 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.240
 also, for example, the Russians in money 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.040
 do 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.110
 we have now deliberately in two 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.020
 you can make it quite money 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.870
 make the kids make a lot of money like 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:26.060
 you want 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.060
 that will stay over you 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:45.639
 I'll leave that for now without giving it 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:48.219
 only once such a stamp 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:50.469
 ok, I wish you much much fun 

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:52.509
 imitate and I'm convinced you 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:55.709
 will be just as great theirs 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.709
 everything is legal
