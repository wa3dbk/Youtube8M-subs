notice when I did the rosters here if
you<00:00:24.750> look<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> players<00:00:25.439> every<00:00:26.430> player

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you look at all the players every player

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
you look at all the players every player
speed<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.930> 99<00:00:28.470> except<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> putter<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
speed is 99 except for the putter and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
speed is 99 except for the putter and
the<00:00:30.000> quarterback<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> left<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.050> alone<00:00:31.320> but

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the quarterback so I left them alone but

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910 
the quarterback so I left them alone but
the<00:00:32.040> reason<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.430> did<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.410> because<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:34.770> one

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the reason I did that is because I'm one

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
the reason I did that is because I'm one
of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> gameplay<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.030> faster<00:00:36.719> cuz<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.559> love
