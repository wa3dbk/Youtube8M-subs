00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I kind of like yellow because it stands

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.920 
I kind of like yellow because it stands
out<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.510> takes<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.200> bit<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.410> time

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
out it just takes a little bit of time

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.560

actually angling your spatula to bring
it<00:02:26.820> around<00:02:26.960> that's<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.230> makes<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.590> smooth<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's what makes having a turntable

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.120 
that's what makes having a turntable
very<00:02:36.930> nice<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.060> actually<00:02:39.570> turning

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130
