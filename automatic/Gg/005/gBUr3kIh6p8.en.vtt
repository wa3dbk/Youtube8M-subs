00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.500 

you<00:00:01.709> started<00:00:02.129> with<00:00:02.220> pure<00:00:02.429> water<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.300> turn

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
you started with pure water and you turn

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:15.369 
you started with pure water and you turn
it<00:00:03.629> into<00:00:03.750> pure<00:00:04.640> h-point<00:00:05.640> HT<00:00:06.240> 2.8<00:00:06.720> 2.0<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.830> 2.0

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.410 

so<00:00:17.119> let<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.270> dissolve<00:00:19.070> let<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:21.090> soap

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so let it dissolve let it the soap

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.710 
so let it dissolve let it the soap
settle<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> top<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.910> extract<00:00:24.359> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
settle to the top and then we extract it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
settle to the top and then we extract it
then<00:00:25.199> we're<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> extrapolate<00:00:25.920> upon<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
then we're going to extrapolate upon it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.150 
then we're going to extrapolate upon it
yes<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.439> need<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.630> filter<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.380> sorts<00:00:34.160> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
yes so we need a filter of some sorts to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
yes so we need a filter of some sorts to
extrapolate<00:00:36.110> we<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.660> paper

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
extrapolate we need to use this paper

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:49.190 
extrapolate we need to use this paper
towel<00:00:41.390> these<00:00:43.010> coffee<00:00:44.010> filters<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:49.050> have

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
towel these coffee filters we have

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.490 
towel these coffee filters we have
learning<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> separate<00:00:50.100> Wow<00:00:50.550> look<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.000> move

you can absolutely see it move it's like
a<00:00:54.539> science<00:00:55.140> experiment<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> with

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
a science experiment you can do it with

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
a science experiment you can do it with
your<00:00:56.520> kids<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.840> legal<00:01:00.050> can<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.109> get
