00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.369
 below in the comments of course me 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.409
 I refer to the game of 100 sites of the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.540
 eighth finals when you are in the ship 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.360
 eliminate the extra with the chelsea 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.900
 after a really incredible game 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.010
 then go 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 a bad memory we try to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.190
 take revenge mertens now as they are 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 remembered I am even more loaded than 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.550
 first mertez is good for us does not know 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.700
 take ok good and good job there 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.410
 let's put in front left or make net e 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.120
 the right guys I remembered the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.920
 measure 1 to 0 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170
 force always say that for boys 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.050
 game we were able to win 3 to 1 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 at home it seems to me 3 to 1 at home and then 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.340
 publish it we are losing 3 a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.190
 1 therefore between a public one creates a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 extra spell and ivanovic where there 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.810
 he did it all in any case 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540
 we must take revenge on this match 1 a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.390
 section inside everyone just like that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.090
 so come chino rebounds lesson 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.459
 ramirez in section williams inside 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.930
 still oscar of heel when we leave you 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.060
 too much space, that is we have them do it 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.180
 seven eight steps of the small age 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.100
 watch them a passing casino in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.340
 small area we believe that after we do 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.720
 goal west for the mertez is good 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.340
 attention to the pretend we can go 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.380
 so you have to go through two instead 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.709
 speed people also a speed 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.900
 left side out of weight no 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.190
 I didn't explain why you put it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.130
 defense to the bitter end 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.840
 no no no no we are not boys no no 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.640
 I like the way she ended up living there 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.260
 people as a unique match and with chelsea 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.450
 much stronger than us 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.030
 the draw is fine but it doesn't make sense 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.769
 cuadrado inside that we hear from May 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.019
 nine hundred space sweep away as if 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.370
 we just have to defend not good not 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.900
 okay ramires 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.570
 damn if you lose your life and if you 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 you lose if you pay attention 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.880
 soncino recovers not swept away 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.130
 we must mark 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.420
 we are very tired we can no longer 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.850
 I ca n't do it any more than I have to 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.710
 I'm running alone just ahead of that 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.920
 I have to do I can't take it anymore 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.370
 there is more of the bar and then it ends 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.620
 ends here 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.390
 one by one at home and now it's tough now it is 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.910
 it lasts because we have to go and win there 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.590
 or draw with two goals 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.880
 at least two goals next game against 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.860
 the Rome now that we have been inserted 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.910
 in the starting lineup and therefore us 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.890
 let's get this one into the field 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.240
 ranking is put very very well 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.340
 because the juve with one game less 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.260
 I'm five so posting though is that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.300
 one game less so we are 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.710
 really put it very very well 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.120
 we'll see each other on the pitch against Rome 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.850
 guys I remind you that the goal 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.980
 of the main of this we say of 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.410
 this league is above the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.440
 phone because I was born here and beat 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 the gilo lipstick record of turin 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.590
 that in the season rho 28 29 1928 1999 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.500
 scored well 36 goals 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.900
 this is the record of goals scored in a 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.310
 then the only championship series 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 I want to try to beat an example that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.900
 I'm 22 22 23 I don't remember 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.460
 so let 's try to hawk kids because 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.330
 we are missing a few games so we are there 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.950
 we see the field 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.420
 well here's the guys moving in for 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.690
 we're on the pitch at the stadium 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.010
 Olympic and now begins Rome in Naples 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.810
 call yourself with a beautiful action 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.730
 try to climb well endowed with genius 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.350
 we can go attention is not low 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.690
 stops us with the claim that they are de 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 santis guardoni Gabbiadini on the race 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.020
 we'll see if we take care of it is 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.000
 beautiful stop we can go mom 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.260
 my defender a void 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.700
 then the stoning of his first 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.440
 we can go and take advantage of the movement 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.120
 then we put it with de left de santis 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.620
 has still exploited the movement of 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.500
 what is coming is brought like that 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.920
 man and then I tried to kick 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.150
 corner 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.090
 inside of head and with on the line though 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.150
 what dance is always at random in the meantime 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.770
 whistles foul but may yet so 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.350
 we can pay attention to the feint 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.370
 let's pass that football is confirmed 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.710
 punishment 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.009
 I can't believe I thought it was 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.779
 My grandfather thus 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.389
 kidding but you're just kidding 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.099
 tooth war I don't know but they do 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.749
 I asked for a replacement 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.349
 now then just the ball come out 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:23.449
 out 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.009
 we will be replaced stand to do any 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.830
 the last action 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.819
 i work boy watch them 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.680
 Seventy-seventh and I asked for the 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.849
 change to the sixtieth with twenty minutes 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.949
 I'm waiting for the ball to come out 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.379
 as well or that stops the game 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.919
 nothing bad goes inside the ball 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.300
 out 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.889
 finally I spoke we are replaced 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.069
 no because i want to be replaced 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.710
 guys but because I'm afraid we say between 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.629
 quotes to lose the game maybe 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.189
 most important of the year ie then between 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.050
 which one against the chelsea you had to 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.610

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.289
 here next game 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.759
 I was hoping we're in the boys field 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.199
 we hope we are in the field because 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.830
 really not a fundamental game 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.149
 I want to play it forcefully if we start 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.800

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.199
