lock into place with this magnetic clip

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.280 
lock into place with this magnetic clip
you<00:03:17.489> see<00:03:17.669> turn<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:17.940> upside<00:03:18.209> down<00:03:21.049> now<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.079> can

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you see turn it upside down now I can

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.110 
you see turn it upside down now I can
shake<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.500> extra<00:03:22.949> hard<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.340> get<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.760> off

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
shake it extra hard and get it off

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.559 
shake it extra hard and get it off
but<00:03:24.690> um<00:03:24.840> basically<00:03:25.970> it's<00:03:26.970> gonna<00:03:27.090> stay<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.479> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
but um basically it's gonna stay in the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.659 
but um basically it's gonna stay in the
place<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.739> I'm<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:28.949> gonna<00:03:29.040> seal<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.519> in

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
place so I'm just gonna seal that in

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.710 
place so I'm just gonna seal that in
there<00:03:29.819> make<00:03:30.030> sure<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.329> not<00:03:30.389> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.629> move

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
there make sure it's not going to move

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.099 
there make sure it's not going to move
around<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.919> that's<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.879> $10<00:03:33.449> right<00:03:33.629> there

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
around and that's it so $10 right there

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.920 
around and that's it so $10 right there
solves<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.859> problem<00:03:34.919> of<00:03:35.489> having<00:03:35.760> your<00:03:36.030> SVU

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
solves that problem of having your SVU

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.780 
solves that problem of having your SVU
case<00:03:37.169> flapping<00:03:37.889> around<00:03:37.979> every<00:03:38.400> time<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.699> hit

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
case flapping around every time you hit

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.059 
case flapping around every time you hit
a<00:03:38.849> bump<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.419> your<00:03:39.540> car<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:40.470> know<00:03:40.590> now

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
a bump in this in your car you know now

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.789 
a bump in this in your car you know now
it<00:03:41.250> stays<00:03:41.489> closed<00:03:42.169> so<00:03:43.169> this<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.379> a<00:03:43.409> good<00:03:43.650> look

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
it stays closed so this is a good look

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.179 
it stays closed so this is a good look
right<00:03:43.949> here<00:03:45.229> turn<00:03:46.229> it<00:03:46.319> upside<00:03:46.590> down<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.979> see

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
right here turn it upside down you see

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.610 
right here turn it upside down you see
it's<00:03:47.669> locked<00:03:47.909> into<00:03:48.120> place

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
it's locked into place

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.979 
it's locked into place
so<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.799> $10<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> definite<00:03:51.689> win<00:03:51.840> right

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
so for $10 this is a definite win right

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:52.999 
so for $10 this is a definite win right
here<00:03:52.139> alright

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
here alright
