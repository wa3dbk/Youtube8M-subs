00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 What date, what year? 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 2018 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 What happened here? 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 The last judgement 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 I knew it would happen 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I thought I knew our enemy 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 But I do not know if we can win this war 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 We are outnumbered by machians 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 And we all lost so much 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 But this is not the future against which my mother warned me 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.250
 Who are you ? 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 John Connor 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 Something has changed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.700
 The devil did not waste his time 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 You and me 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.750
 We had been at war 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 even before we were born 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.250
 You tried to kill my mother 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 You killed my father 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.750
 If we stay there 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.600
 We are dead 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 We are all dead 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.500
 You will not kill me 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 We will not lose 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.200
 This war ends tonight 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 THE 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.750
 END 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 START
