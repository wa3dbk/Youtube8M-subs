00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.969
 So I guess you can not keep your 30's. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 It's going to be hard . It's something you did not do right now. 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 Indoor locations and arches have some outdoor dogs for the dogs and birthdays 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.320
 There are treatments for hi sorrow, and if you have a national cold, 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.559

 The decision maker does not have any of the following people. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.960
 At that time, I am going to the committee in the division of the window , 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.689
 There is no one, and there is no executive committee itself . 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.700

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.990
 Maybe the amount is still there because of the amount 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 That's just another earthquake does see fit to our emotions wrestle this example we 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.680
