00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.279
 today which one rise like one at one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.629
 sony xperia it the display changes 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.160
 By the way, in my video description 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.570
 finds its spare parts and tools which 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.070
 I also just use it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:21.600
 read through so take your tools the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 hand and let's get started so catch 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 Let's start with that first 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 sony out that should not be possible 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 you can later, exceptionally, the battery 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.189
 just disconnect so now we remove 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380
 the backcover by pointing it up 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.949
 push 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.210
 then we solve the ten 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:43.530
 screws the back now we can 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.239
 with a plastic chair the back 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 Carefully raise and connected 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.280
 loosen flex cable and then simply open 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.280
 lay the page 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.930
 Next we remove the battery 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.289
 Now we can all flex connection 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.289
 with a plastic tool 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.820
 then we solve the three lower ones 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 screw 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 then we can on the left 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.729
 side the knobs of the bracket loose 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 then carefully the complete unit 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.000
 Raise since but very carefully 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.530
 on the other side 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 antenna cable is still connected 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.570
 this then solve everything on the side 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570
 lay 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.579
 Now we can use the board carefully 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 lose weight 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.960
 Lastly, we still have the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.969
 remove the remaining components 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 on off button electronics the earpiece 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.890
 antenna cable and the whole buttons 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.920
 Once that's done we can do that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.030
 take new display and do it without 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.890
 reverse order again 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.880
 Assemble the first button 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.880
 reinstall elements 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 now connect the mainboard and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.120
 mount 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.340
 then the complete lower one 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.660
 Install electronics again 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.280
 that antennas cavadas first 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:34.310
 Only then can you connect it 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:35.960
 a correct position now bring the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.260
 Knobs bring all the flex cables back 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.260
 connect 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.940
 Now we can install the battery again 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.940
 and then connect the back 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.030
 last backcover again 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.470
 attach the device and turn it on 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.270
 Check whether you have done everything right 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.489

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.930
