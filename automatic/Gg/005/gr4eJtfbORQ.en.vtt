in emissions the amount of correct they
appear<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.039> called<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.179> squirts<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
appear to be called the squirts I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
appear to be called the squirts I
official<00:00:26.400> advice<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> works<00:00:27.570> quite<00:00:27.869> well

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
official advice and it works quite well

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.829 
official advice and it works quite well
and<00:00:28.679> uh<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> nothing<00:00:29.640> me<00:00:29.999> about<00:00:30.509> what

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
and uh so there is nothing me about what

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.630 
and uh so there is nothing me about what
mister<00:00:31.230> things<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> did<00:00:32.400> a<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.579> more

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
mister things so I did a bit more

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.380 
mister things so I did a bit more
research<00:00:33.980> discovered<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.520> vibrating<00:00:36.210> weak

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
research discovered these vibrating weak

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
research discovered these vibrating weak
devices<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.740> these<00:00:38.040> things<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.640> sir<00:00:39.060> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

thing and this time what I've done here
is<00:00:47.040> only<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.610> never<00:00:47.940> touch<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.450> cap

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
is only really never touch a little cap

Richard to the barest but just being in
there<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.630> look<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.140> magnets<00:01:01.650> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there now you look at the magnets you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
there now you look at the magnets you
can<00:01:02.130> see<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.580> they've<00:01:02.760> been<00:01:02.790> put<00:01:03.300> against

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
can see that they've been put against

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
can see that they've been put against
the<00:01:04.320> actual<00:01:04.439> age<00:01:05.009> no<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> magnets<00:01:05.909> are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the actual age no the magnets are

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
the actual age no the magnets are
basically<00:01:06.299> fixed<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> resting<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
basically fixed I just resting in this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
basically fixed I just resting in this
bit<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> steel<00:01:08.070> underneath<00:01:08.579> them<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
bit of steel underneath them here so to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
bit of steel underneath them here so to
stop<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.020> magnets<00:01:10.499> sticking<00:01:10.859> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> Reed<00:01:11.249> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
stop the magnets sticking to the Reed I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
stop the magnets sticking to the Reed I
put<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> couple<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.210> flaps<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.840> rubber

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
put a couple of little flaps of rubber

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
put a couple of little flaps of rubber
in<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> got<00:01:14.219> from<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.520> rubber<00:01:14.700> band<00:01:16.939> called

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
in that I got from a rubber band called

I<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.210> device<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> lot<00:02:29.840> actually<00:02:30.110> it's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
I like the device a lot actually it's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.000 
I like the device a lot actually it's
very<00:02:31.160> pretty

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
very pretty

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.980 
very pretty
let's<00:02:34.010> proceed<00:02:34.190> inaudible<00:02:34.820> speaker<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.810> is

let's proceed inaudible speaker it is

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.410 
let's proceed inaudible speaker it is

part of not one that this particular
implementation<00:02:38.800> incidentally<00:02:39.940> understands

because<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.420> another<00:02:41.660> few<00:02:41.780> design

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
because have another few design

because have another few design
disarming<00:02:42.860> decisions<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.700> can't<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
disarming decisions I can't like it

being<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.290> view<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.280> put<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.670> block<00:02:46.910> of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
being on the view so I put the block of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.910 
being on the view so I put the block of
the<00:02:47.150> drives<00:02:47.360> mechanism<00:02:47.990> down<00:02:48.110> here<00:02:48.410> below<00:02:48.650> the

the drives mechanism down here below the

the drives mechanism down here below the
bowl<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> speaker<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.780> means<00:02:51.020> that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
bowl of the speaker and that means that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.500 
bowl of the speaker and that means that
I've<00:02:51.320> had<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.650> attach<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.220> arm<00:02:52.460> here<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:53.330> it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
I've had to attach this arm here to it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870 
I've had to attach this arm here to it
and<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.200> time<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.710> obviously<00:02:54.860> vibrating<00:02:55.760> in

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and this time is obviously vibrating in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.690 
and this time is obviously vibrating in
itself<00:02:56.330> when<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:56.900> vibrating<00:02:57.320> sideways<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
itself when it's vibrating sideways and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.570 
itself when it's vibrating sideways and
this<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.140> all<00:03:00.320> those<00:03:00.470> extra<00:03:00.710> vibrations

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
this way and all those extra vibrations

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.400 
this way and all those extra vibrations
are<00:03:01.790> loss<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.120> power<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.810> get<00:03:02.930> much<00:03:03.170> better

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
are loss of power you get much better

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.500

would lead vibrated with in its own free

roundly

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
roundly

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.180 
roundly
in<00:04:17.789> bar<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.810> that's<00:04:19.019> just<00:04:19.349> a<00:04:19.470> weakness<00:04:19.919> of<00:04:20.069> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
in bar and that's just a weakness of the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.969 
in bar and that's just a weakness of the
field<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:20.699> really<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.239> coil<00:04:21.509> could<00:04:21.750> be

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
field what really that coil could be

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.339 
field what really that coil could be
much<00:04:22.979> much<00:04:23.280> closer<00:04:23.699> to<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.449> bar<00:04:24.629> and<00:04:24.930> again<00:04:25.110> we

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
much much closer to the bar and again we

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.899 
much much closer to the bar and again we
get<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.560> better<00:04:25.800> power<00:04:26.069> transmission<00:04:26.639> out<00:04:26.759> of

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
get a better power transmission out of

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.450 
get a better power transmission out of
that<00:04:27.090> there's<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.020> force<00:04:28.289> with<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.740> there<00:04:29.250> on

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
that there's the force with it there on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.640 
that there's the force with it there on
the<00:04:29.639> whole<00:04:29.879> I<00:04:30.240> think<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:30.900> does<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.169> good

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
the whole I think it does a really good

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.219 
the whole I think it does a really good
job<00:04:31.710> for<00:04:32.220> what<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:32.490> meant<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.759> do<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.840> I

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
job for what it's meant to do and I

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.320 
job for what it's meant to do and I
really<00:04:34.560> quite<00:04:34.770> like<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.340> thing<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.120> think

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
really quite like the thing and I think

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.930 
really quite like the thing and I think
it's<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.569> lot<00:04:36.690> prettier<00:04:36.930> than<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.949> lot<00:04:38.909> of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
it's a lot prettier than a lot of

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.420 
it's a lot prettier than a lot of
speakers<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.569> you<00:04:39.720> can<00:04:39.960> buy<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:41.099> the<00:04:41.190> sound

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
speakers that you can buy and the sound

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.990 
speakers that you can buy and the sound
output<00:04:41.729> really<00:04:42.419> isn't<00:04:42.509> that<00:04:42.810> bad
