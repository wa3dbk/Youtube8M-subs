quick we're going to teach you how to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.640 
quick we're going to teach you how to
close<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.820> distance<00:00:26.180> on<00:00:26.300> your<00:00:26.329> opponent<00:00:26.840> now

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
close the distance on your opponent now

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.109 
close the distance on your opponent now
this<00:00:27.829> could<00:00:28.040> be<00:00:28.099> in<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.400> scenario<00:00:28.880> where<00:00:29.090> you

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
this could be in a scenario where you

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.450 
this could be in a scenario where you
want<00:00:29.419> to<00:00:29.509> get<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:29.810> on<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:29.989> really<00:00:30.290> fast<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:31.099> stop

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
want to get in on a really fast to stop

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.940 
want to get in on a really fast to stop
it<00:00:31.759> you<00:00:32.000> know<00:00:32.540> to<00:00:32.870> get<00:00:33.050> there<00:00:33.200> first<00:00:33.470> and<00:00:33.770> beat

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
it you know to get there first and beat

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.979 
it you know to get there first and beat
into<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.160> point<00:00:34.489> or<00:00:35.090> if<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:35.510> was<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.660> multiple

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
into the point or if it was a multiple

into the point or if it was a multiple
attacker<00:00:36.410> scenario<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:37.520> want<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.790> kind<00:00:37.940> of

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
attacker scenario you want to kind of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.730 
attacker scenario you want to kind of
get<00:00:38.239> in<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.480> one<00:00:38.720> guy<00:00:38.870> quickly<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.500> give

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
get in on one guy quickly to give

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.280 
get in on one guy quickly to give
yourself<00:00:40.490> opportunity<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.360> space<00:00:41.810> to<00:00:42.140> then

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
yourself opportunity and space to then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.770 
yourself opportunity and space to then
deal<00:00:42.530> with<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:42.770> next<00:00:43.040> guy<00:00:43.190> whatever<00:00:44.090> maybe<00:00:44.450> is

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
deal with the next guy whatever maybe is

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.420 
deal with the next guy whatever maybe is
if<00:00:44.930> there's<00:00:45.140> an<00:00:45.230> efficient<00:00:45.740> way<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.010> doing<00:00:46.310> it

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
if there's an efficient way of doing it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.210 
if there's an efficient way of doing it
more<00:00:47.150> efficient<00:00:47.690> than<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.080> taking<00:00:48.350> several

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
more efficient than just taking several

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.480 
more efficient than just taking several
of<00:00:49.670> your<00:00:49.790> normal<00:00:50.090> footwork<00:00:50.630> steps<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:52.460> I

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
of your normal footwork steps so but I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.610 
of your normal footwork steps so but I
take<00:00:52.700> it<00:00:53.270> wasn't<00:00:53.840> going<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.050> try<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.230> close<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
take it wasn't going to try to close the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.770 
take it wasn't going to try to close the
distance<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:55.190> let's<00:00:55.400> say<00:00:55.580> it<00:00:56.060> was<00:00:56.210> three<00:00:56.450> four

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
distance of let's say it was three four

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.080 
distance of let's say it was three four
or<00:00:56.990> five<00:00:57.230> hundred<00:00:58.040> many<00:00:58.310> feet<00:00:58.579> up<00:00:58.700> on<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.880> move

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
or five hundred many feet up on a move

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.870 
or five hundred many feet up on a move
in<00:00:59.270> instead<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.350> taking<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:00.890> know<00:01:01.010> one<00:01:01.310> two<00:01:01.670> or

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
in instead of taking you know one two or

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.869 
in instead of taking you know one two or
three<00:01:02.240> of<00:01:02.510> my<00:01:02.690> normal<00:01:03.079> steps<00:01:03.380> it's<00:01:04.369> much<00:01:04.699> more

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
three of my normal steps it's much more

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.940 
three of my normal steps it's much more
efficient<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.540> more<00:01:05.750> explosive<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.619> actually

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
efficient and more explosive to actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.520 
efficient and more explosive to actually
take<00:01:07.189> one<00:01:07.430> small<00:01:07.700> one<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.079> one<00:01:09.259> bigger

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
take one small one and then one bigger

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.510 
take one small one and then one bigger
one<00:01:09.770> okay<00:01:10.759> now<00:01:10.969> so<00:01:11.630> what<00:01:11.780> I'm<00:01:11.840> going<00:01:11.929> to<00:01:11.990> do<00:01:12.109> is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
one okay now so what I'm going to do is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.830 
one okay now so what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.549> small<00:01:13.819> step<00:01:14.240> that's<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.659> give

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
take a small step that's going to give

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.020 
take a small step that's going to give
me<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> little<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:15.499> cheat<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.640> not<00:01:16.700> only

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
me a little bit of a cheat and not only

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.550 
me a little bit of a cheat and not only
am<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.119> gonna<00:01:17.270> get<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.569> little<00:01:17.899> bit<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.079> space<00:01:18.350> I

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
am I gonna get a little bit of space I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.309 
am I gonna get a little bit of space I
want<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.490> I'm<00:01:19.609> actually<00:01:19.939> using<00:01:20.569> this<00:01:20.719> to<00:01:21.020> load

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
want but I'm actually using this to load

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.039 
want but I'm actually using this to load
up<00:01:21.679> heavy<00:01:22.009> on<00:01:22.280> my<00:01:22.429> front<00:01:22.639> leg<00:01:22.850> okay<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:23.899> I'm

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
up heavy on my front leg okay so I'm

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.959 
up heavy on my front leg okay so I'm
taking<00:01:24.499> this<00:01:24.679> small<00:01:24.920> one<00:01:25.130> put<00:01:25.700> into<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
taking this small one put into the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.940 
taking this small one put into the
weight<00:01:26.149> heavy<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.840> front<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.740> then

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
weight heavy on the front and then

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.649 
weight heavy on the front and then
taking<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.490> bigger<00:01:28.700> one<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.090> second<00:01:29.479> step

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
taking the bigger one on the second step

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.139 
taking the bigger one on the second step
okay<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.319> then<00:01:30.469> usually<00:01:30.679> we<00:01:31.490> don't<00:01:31.729> want<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
okay and then usually we don't want to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.730 
okay and then usually we don't want to
put<00:01:32.329> too<00:01:32.479> much<00:01:32.569> weight<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.109> foot<00:01:33.139> you<00:01:33.619> want

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
put too much weight on one foot you want

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.849 
put too much weight on one foot you want
to<00:01:33.889> stay<00:01:34.159> neutral<00:01:34.759> in<00:01:35.270> our<00:01:35.539> base<00:01:35.749> but<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.740> is

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
to stay neutral in our base but this is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.859 
to stay neutral in our base but this is
one<00:01:37.039> of<00:01:37.069> those<00:01:37.249> exceptions<00:01:37.579> okay<00:01:38.420> good<00:01:38.689> when<00:01:38.840> I

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
one of those exceptions okay good when I

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.379 
one of those exceptions okay good when I
do<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.289> when<00:01:40.189> I<00:01:40.219> put<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> weight<00:01:40.819> heavy<00:01:41.179> on

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
do this when I put the weight heavy on
