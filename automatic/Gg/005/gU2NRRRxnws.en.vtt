00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to spend you'll need a camera and the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640 
to spend you'll need a camera and the
best<00:00:29.970> camera<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.510> planetary<00:00:30.840> imaging<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
best camera for planetary imaging is the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.150 
best camera for planetary imaging is the
webcam<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:33.450> might<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.840> able<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> DSLR

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
webcam you might be able to use a DSLR

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
webcam you might be able to use a DSLR
and<00:00:35.430> I've<00:00:36.000> made<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> separate<00:00:36.690> video<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and I've made a separate video on that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.160 
and I've made a separate video on that
but<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> main<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.940> video<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but the main point of that video is to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
but the main point of that video is to
try<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> talk<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
try to talk you out of it and to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.110 
try to talk you out of it and to
convince<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> use<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> webcam<00:00:42.600> instead

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
convince you to use a webcam instead

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.490 
convince you to use a webcam instead
there<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.149> websites<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
there are websites that show you how to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
there are websites that show you how to
take<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> cheapy<00:00:47.219> webcam<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> may

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
take a cheapy webcam that you may

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
take a cheapy webcam that you may
already<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.050> modify<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> attach<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
already have and modify it to attach to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
already have and modify it to attach to
your<00:00:51.090> telescope<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.620> I've<00:00:52.739> seen<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.160> pretty

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
your telescope and I've seen some pretty

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
your telescope and I've seen some pretty
good<00:00:53.520> pictures<00:00:53.850> by<00:00:54.449> people<00:00:54.809> who<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.020> done

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
good pictures by people who have done

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
good pictures by people who have done
that<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> recommend<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that but I recommend that you use a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.360 
that but I recommend that you use a
webcam<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:58.109> been<00:00:58.350> specifically<00:00:58.859> designed

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
webcam that's been specifically designed

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
webcam that's been specifically designed
for<00:00:59.579> telescope<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.829> those<00:01:01.829> cameras

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for telescope use those cameras

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
for telescope use those cameras
typically<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.910> higher<00:01:03.149> frame<00:01:03.480> rates<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
typically have higher frame rates and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
typically have higher frame rates and
more<00:01:04.500> control<00:01:04.860> over<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> exposure<00:01:05.220> settings

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
more control over the exposure settings

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.289 
more control over the exposure settings
and<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.960> color<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.470> monochrome<00:01:08.299> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and they come in color or monochrome you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
and they come in color or monochrome you
can<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.659> color<00:01:09.990> pictures<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> monochrome

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
can get color pictures with a monochrome

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
can get color pictures with a monochrome
camera<00:01:11.790> by<00:01:12.330> taking<00:01:12.720> separate<00:01:13.110> pictures<00:01:13.439> two

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
camera by taking separate pictures two

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
camera by taking separate pictures two
different<00:01:14.040> colored<00:01:14.250> filters<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> combining

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
different colored filters and combining

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
different colored filters and combining
it<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.189> some<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.580> best

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it all in one some of the very best

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.550 
it all in one some of the very best
pictures<00:01:18.180> I've<00:01:18.299> seen<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.229> done<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pictures I've seen have been done this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.999 
pictures I've seen have been done this
way<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> crummiest<00:01:22.009> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
way and also some of the crummiest it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
way and also some of the crummiest it
requires<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.729> skill<00:01:23.939> more<00:01:24.659> time<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.200> learn

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
requires more skill more time to learn

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.730 
requires more skill more time to learn
and<00:01:25.680> there's<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.640> ways<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> mess<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.750> don't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and there's more ways to mess up I don't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
and there's more ways to mess up I don't
have<00:01:29.070> any<00:01:29.280> experience<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.970> monochrome

have any experience with monochrome

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719 
have any experience with monochrome
cameras<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> cost

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
cameras but I do know it's going to cost

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580

you<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.240> you'll<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.380> color

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you a little more you'll need color

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.490 
you a little more you'll need color

this image of Jupiter can change

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.290 
this image of Jupiter can change
drastically<00:02:22.160> how<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> appears<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.940> by

changing the viewing angle a little bit

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.330 
changing the viewing angle a little bit
so<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.510> use<00:02:27.720> my<00:02:27.930> desktop<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.650> processing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
diameter of the telescope so the bigger

scopes<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.420> are<00:02:54.540> much<00:02:54.690> larger<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.430> think

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
scopes that are much larger I think

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280 
scopes that are much larger I think
though<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.360> amount<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.630> awesomeness

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
though that the amount of awesomeness

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.480 
though that the amount of awesomeness
that<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.740> get<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.070> these<00:02:59.220> smaller

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
that you can get with these smaller

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.090 
that you can get with these smaller
scopes<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.510> good<00:03:00.840> enough<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.350> get<00:03:01.500> many<00:03:01.770> people

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
scopes is good enough to get many people

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
excited about this new hobby if you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.350 
excited about this new hobby if you
don't<00:03:05.070> already<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.580> telescope<00:03:06.000> I

don't already have a telescope I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900 
don't already have a telescope I
recommend<00:03:07.110> getting<00:03:07.230> an<00:03:07.560> SCT<00:03:08.130> type<00:03:08.340> scope<00:03:08.670> if

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
recommend getting an SCT type scope if

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.750 
recommend getting an SCT type scope if
your<00:03:09.420> main<00:03:09.600> goal<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.140> planetary<00:03:10.590> imaging

there's<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.910> good<00:03:15.150> chance<00:03:15.420> you're<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.840> to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
there's a good chance you're going to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.920 
there's a good chance you're going to
need<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> Barlow<00:03:16.500> lens<00:03:17.209> planets<00:03:18.209> appear<00:03:18.600> very

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
need a Barlow lens planets appear very

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.290 
need a Barlow lens planets appear very
tiny<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.470> us<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> enlarge<00:03:21.030> them

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
tiny to us and we need to enlarge them

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.900 
tiny to us and we need to enlarge them
as<00:03:21.420> much<00:03:21.570> as<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.250> but<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.459> enlarge<00:03:23.730> them

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
as much as we can but if we enlarge them

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.240 
as much as we can but if we enlarge them
too<00:03:24.120> much<00:03:24.269> they<00:03:24.540> become<00:03:24.959> too<00:03:25.230> dim<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
too much they become too dim and the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.030 
too much they become too dim and the
exposure<00:03:26.489> time<00:03:26.790> becomes<00:03:27.120> too<00:03:27.330> great<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
exposure time becomes too great so it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.770 
exposure time becomes too great so it
turns<00:03:29.220> out<00:03:29.370> there's<00:03:29.580> an<00:03:29.700> optimal<00:03:30.150> focal<00:03:30.480> ratio

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
turns out there's an optimal focal ratio

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.490 
turns out there's an optimal focal ratio
typically<00:03:31.709> between<00:03:32.010> f10<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.910> f30<00:03:33.480> which<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
typically between f10 and f30 which is a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.640 
typically between f10 and f30 which is a
function<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> pixel<00:03:35.489> size<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.150> camera

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
function of the pixel size of the camera

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
function of the pixel size of the camera
so<00:03:37.650> you're<00:03:37.769> probably<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.280> need<00:03:38.459> a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
so you're probably going to need a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.790 
so you're probably going to need a
