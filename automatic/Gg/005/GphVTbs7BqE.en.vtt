00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.009
 I hope it's going well for you 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.200
 anyway me it's going great actually 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.430
 today a small point on my team 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.590
 so 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.820
 so since I had the people 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.370
 yvonne I showed you on the video 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.300
 there you have not you have not them 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.079
 go back so today 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.860
 I wanted to go back after my team 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.470
 she has undergone a lot of changes so 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.769
 I will explain all this so already 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.430
 you have to ask where is where is 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.250
 the rice bag did not consecrate the fact that 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.199
 the ck i lai game stop it but i 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.239
 art is a little bit for the moment 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.140
 of well mounted well this show 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.970
 well let you do it so that it is well 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.210
 well equipped so that for who manages well 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.500
 and then I'll go back to the thing 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.950
 especially for kamas that I stopped 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.890
 because I 'm not a big rich person 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.100
 and so I can not I can not 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.479
 assume I can but for the moment 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.640
 I prefer to go slowly I prefer 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.190
 not to disgust me so go slowly 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.509
 after why do too much guard three 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.580
 because sometimes I like 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.280
 to make a small package so with three 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.289
 people at least the three cradles the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.039
 three characters are in the group 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.800
 so that's the way I'm left 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.890
 fram the coronation it eliminates so go i'm going 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.910
 first introduce you bombay mans 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.619
 who in whom reveals them 134 soon 135 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:55.539
 by the way so it is I'm riding them fast 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.920
 besides, I do not hear any more 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.530
 hey there is not a lot of good wisdom 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.759
 chorus the bumper t50 wisdom good 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.890
 there he does not have too much wisdom because 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 that he did not have I could I have more 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.310
 of energy on the d 10 but so good the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.120
 gutters 23 May it adds I do not have 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 it's a bit the 300 so so he's there 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 is fast with a breakdown at rm so it's 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.930
 not a super panels finally good there I 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.520
 do not like the rage of a panel but 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.900
 I feel I changed and I think 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.269
 I wait for it and I will keep it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.819
 up to the level at the level of the breakdown at 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.240
 racing 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.300
 because after before brings the panel 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.510
 asks his royal with the crown and the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.550
 cape that the slip things there I do not see 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.110
 too much what has four other 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.480
 panels so here I 'll quickly made the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.590
 change too I never had it without 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.260
 reserve so I put that in the meantime 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.930
 but that too so that's good it's not the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.130
 sacred he has no issue loses no but 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.130
 good for far so that's fine 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.320
 the hammer was good for roque it's 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.830
 a little bit so that's all I said on my 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.240
 little it screams dampier 834 and I passed 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.830
 au ni ni 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.530
 so the ni nor it's level 128 that he did 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.160
 not yet the whole panel so I read 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.990
 is not christmas m so i'm going to increase 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.810
 I love booster 50 wisdom running at 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.840
 can not want more of that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.990
 good in a tail to 572 he has not yet 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.319
 all the dough have so I took a 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.530
 alliance 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.150
 photo there in the meantime because I have 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.360
 surely put the tip to the cm 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.379
 so when he will have the level so no he 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:55.750
 I still have the royal belt august at m la 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.549
 baguette so the party 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.680
 I did not know too much about the company 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.180
 a friend 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.540
 I think that one self I could not 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.030
 put because it's shocking even the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.879
 price I do not want to allow myself to put 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.629
 tone below for the night so I 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.449
 think i think rmc m it's going 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.829
 So if you have stÃ©phane 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.270
 advise for the night 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.100
 it's not a refusal I would not help 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 wrong so 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.970
 so here I think I did everything 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.070
 for that too so good the ni ni 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:39.620
 he does not want much yet but 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:45.639
 intense and I tell myself if we look at words 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:49.460
 of sacrifices level 5 21 to 31 and level 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.039
 6148 38 to 43 so it changes anyway 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.620
 so I tell myself they 'll see that it's 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.800
 better when it will be the l6 the spell so 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.870

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.510
