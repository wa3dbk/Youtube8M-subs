00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
and we didn't know how to read the water

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.430 
and we didn't know how to read the water
level<00:01:07.040> for<00:01:07.340> when<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.850> when<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.150> would<00:01:08.330> win<00:01:09.290> was

level for when for when we would win was

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.500 
level for when for when we would win was
a<00:01:09.470> good<00:01:09.680> time<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.010> go<00:01:10.100> up<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:10.820> we<00:01:10.940> probably<00:01:11.240> went

a good time to go up so we probably went

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.090 
a good time to go up so we probably went
up<00:01:11.659> with<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.840> water<00:01:12.140> cook<00:01:12.500> higher<00:01:12.710> than<00:01:13.010> it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
up with the water cook higher than it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.950 
up with the water cook higher than it
should<00:01:13.130> have<00:01:13.310> been<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:14.270> went<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:14.600> where<00:01:14.840> it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
should have been so we went in where it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.170 
should have been so we went in where it
was<00:01:15.110> fairly<00:01:15.380> shallow<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:16.250> it's<00:01:16.490> shallow

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
was fairly shallow and then it's shallow

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.120 
was fairly shallow and then it's shallow
it<00:01:17.570> was<00:01:17.720> coming<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.590> her<00:01:18.680> shoulder

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.260 
it was coming up here on her shoulder
and<00:01:19.630> every<00:01:21.369> crossing<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:22.670> got<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.000> get<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
and every crossing we got to get a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.640 
and every crossing we got to get a
little<00:01:23.479> deeper<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.050> were<00:01:24.140> really<00:01:24.290> pushing

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650
