pop and then full pot which is the most
aggressive<00:01:51.090> form<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> processing<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
aggressive form of the processing and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.609

interesting<00:02:21.459> how<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.330> how<00:02:22.630> does<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.900> work

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
interesting how does it how does it work

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.490 
interesting how does it how does it work
what<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.580> as<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.090> image<00:02:25.300> comes<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:25.810> we

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
what we do is as the image comes in we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.710 
what we do is as the image comes in we
mathematically<00:02:27.100> great<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.850> left<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.510> right

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
mathematically great a left and right

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.199 
mathematically great a left and right
image<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.160> deep<00:02:30.670> focus<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
image and we then deep focus and

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.759 
image and we then deep focus and
subtract<00:02:31.570> out<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.019> that<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.560> depth

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
subtract out of that the depth

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.220 
subtract out of that the depth
information<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.760> smuggle<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.540> back<00:02:34.750> into<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
information and smuggle it back into the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.860 
information and smuggle it back into the
2d<00:02:35.920> image<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:36.970> we're<00:02:37.120> doing<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.630> we're

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
2d image so what we're doing is we're

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.199 
2d image so what we're doing is we're
adapting<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.950> image<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.489> way<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.880> human

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
adapting the image to the way your human

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.080
