Going Out With Cheki Camera

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.701
Perfect

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.555
Have you been here?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.229
No yet so I don't know much about here.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:12.737
Taking some?

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.970
Yes I am taking photos!

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:24.947
I took a photo of myself by cheki 
 for the first time just then. 

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:13.530
I've dressed up like a b-girl today.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.690
This sweatshirt is very rare and this is 
 the only one exist in this world.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.240
I'm wearing Nike socks to suit this type of fashion.

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:33.250
I would like to wear pumps or sandals 
 with heels in the spring and summer.

Going Out With Cheki Camera

00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:54.010
A hidden place?

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.840
This is my favorite place to eat!

00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:06.030
Is it open now?

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.120
I doubt it.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.070
You can have beautiful ramen here. They are open.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.530
Many ramen restaurants use this mark.

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:28.750
Ready?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.170
It's perfect!

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.660
Yay!

00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:53.730
I bought this clutch bag from a store called Uni Brown.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.800
These are pearl earrings. I bought them from the shop called Aquagirl.

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:17.330
I bought this ring in South Korea.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:23.030
I found these earrings at an op-shop in Shimokitazawa.

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:47.900
Wanna take a photo of it?

00:04:48.407 --> 00:04:50.170

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.390
Here it is.

00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:55.480
I wanna sprinkle some sesame seeds on mine.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.110
Sesame seeds..

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.620

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.100
Looks so yummy!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.110
Yeah it's good.

00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:29.260
It's hard.

00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:33.930
I ate a lot!

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.300
I'm full. That was a nice meal!

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.900
Oh my stomach.. I'm very full..

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.930
