has<00:01:48.180> odd<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> brilliant<00:01:48.780> player<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> think

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
has odd is a brilliant player I think

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.859 
has odd is a brilliant player I think
he's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.070> difference<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:51.240> Chelsea<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
he's the difference at Chelsea at the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.940 
he's the difference at Chelsea at the
moment<00:01:52.229> arm<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.990> why<00:01:55.259> he's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
moment arm and I can see why he's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
moment arm and I can see why he's
probably<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.270> me

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
probably going to get it but for me

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.620 
probably going to get it but for me
that's<00:01:58.320> why<00:01:58.680> God<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.130> Alexis<00:01:59.549> no<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> agree

deservedly<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:47.620> hopefully<00:02:48.620> next

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
deservedly so I think but hopefully next

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.160 
deservedly so I think but hopefully next
year<00:02:49.090> he'll<00:02:50.090> reach<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.480> next<00:02:50.660> level<00:02:50.870> because

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
year he'll reach that next level because

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.660 
year he'll reach that next level because
