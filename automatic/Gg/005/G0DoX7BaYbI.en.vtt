and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> spit<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.390> drop<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.259> kind

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and then I get spit out drop that kind

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.639 
and then I get spit out drop that kind
of<00:01:44.369> matters<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.939> mean<00:01:45.119> he<00:01:45.240> could<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.570> just

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
of matters I mean he could have just

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.899 
of matters I mean he could have just
recover<00:01:46.649> stalled<00:01:46.979> me<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.729> if

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
recover stalled me for a little bit if

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
recover stalled me for a little bit if
he<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> didn't<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.229> since<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.860> did

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
he if I didn't get it but since I did

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
he if I didn't get it but since I did
I'll<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.610> able<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.259> guess

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I'll be able to take it out and I guess

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
ball Magnezone did enough work I don't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.559 
ball Magnezone did enough work I don't
really<00:02:16.400> need<00:02:16.549> to<00:02:16.640> bother<00:02:16.760> saving<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.299> so

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
really need to bother saving it so

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.009 
really need to bother saving it so
that's<00:02:18.440> gonna<00:02:18.680> work<00:02:18.920> out<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.220> my<00:02:19.250> favor<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:20.060> was

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
that's gonna work out in my favor I was

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.690 
that's gonna work out in my favor I was
able<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.290> live<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.500> fire<00:02:21.739> blasted<00:02:22.190> my<00:02:22.310> HP

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
able to live the fire blasted my HP

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.640 
able to live the fire blasted my HP
investment<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.980> was<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:26.209> huge<00:02:26.810> moment

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
investment so that was a huge moment

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.009 
investment so that was a huge moment
there<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.760> predict<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.209> switch<00:02:29.390> he

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
there so I predict the switch he

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.839 
there so I predict the switch he
probably<00:02:30.290> he<00:02:30.769> has<00:02:30.920> dazzlingly<00:02:31.430> he<00:02:31.700> just

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
probably he has dazzlingly he just

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.890 
probably he has dazzlingly he just
probably<00:02:31.970> put<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.209> through<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.420> sacrifice<00:02:32.690> oh

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
probably put it through the sacrifice oh

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.750 
probably put it through the sacrifice oh
I'm<00:02:32.959> gonna<00:02:33.110> get<00:02:33.200> him<00:02:33.290> up<00:02:33.500> an<00:02:33.620> SD<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.190> figure<00:02:34.700> you

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
I'm gonna get him up an SD I figure you

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
I'm gonna get him up an SD I figure you
know<00:02:34.849> what<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.209> won't<00:02:35.540> live<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> moon<00:02:35.840> blast<00:02:36.110> but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
know what I won't live a moon blast but

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.759 
know what I won't live a moon blast but
if<00:02:36.620> i<00:02:36.709> can<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:36.920> off<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.099> plane<00:02:37.129> rough<00:02:37.519> on<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
if i can get off a plane rough on the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.710 
if i can get off a plane rough on the
floor<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.160> if<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.519> should<00:02:40.730> almost<00:02:41.000> kill<00:02:41.569> it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
floor just if it should almost kill it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.569 
floor just if it should almost kill it
and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.140> i'll<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:42.890> able<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.129> come<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.400> and

and then i'll be able to come in and

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.569 
and then i'll be able to come in and
clean<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.569> with<00:02:44.900> something<00:02:45.379> else<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.769> i<00:02:45.980> am

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
clean up with something else so i am

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.190 
clean up with something else so i am
gonna<00:02:46.670> hit<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:46.879> with<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> play<00:02:47.569> rough<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.989> does

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200

nearly kill it and I'm dad to move last

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.069 
nearly kill it and I'm dad to move last
like<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.110> thought<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:55.069> really<00:02:55.720> helps<00:02:56.720> so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
gonna go an homage Jonathan I've been

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.710 
gonna go an homage Jonathan I've been
using<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.819> lot<00:02:58.849> lately<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.510> just<00:02:59.660> a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
using it a lot lately it's just a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.150 
using it a lot lately it's just a
coincidence<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.560> today's<00:03:00.769> battle

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
coincidence that it's in today's battle

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.479 
coincidence that it's in today's battle
as<00:03:01.310> well<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.519> didn't<00:03:01.910> actually<00:03:03.160> intend<00:03:04.160> that

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
as well I didn't actually intend that

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.949 
as well I didn't actually intend that
way<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.879> just<00:03:05.269> figured<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.540> know<00:03:05.690> what<00:03:05.810> let's

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
way I just figured you know what let's

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.839 
way I just figured you know what let's
throw<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.650> battle<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.579> turns

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
throw that this battle up and it turns

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.059 
throw that this battle up and it turns
out<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.120> he's<00:03:09.079> in<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.650> he<00:03:09.739> does<00:03:09.889> some

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
out that he's in there and he does some

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.920 
out that he's in there and he does some
work<00:03:10.190> at<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.430> end<00:03:10.609> to<00:03:10.760> clean<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.030> up<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:11.480> I

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
work at the end to clean it up but I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.809 
work at the end to clean it up but I
think<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:12.950> actually<00:03:13.340> might<00:03:13.609> even<00:03:13.730> be

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
think that that actually might even be

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.640 
think that that actually might even be
the<00:03:13.940> first<00:03:14.180> earthquake<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.810> use<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.230> I'm<00:03:15.319> not

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
the first earthquake I use what I'm not

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.160 
the first earthquake I use what I'm not
sure<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:17.209> wouldn't<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.540> surprising<00:03:17.870> though

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
sure it wouldn't be surprising though

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.690 
sure it wouldn't be surprising though
it's<00:03:18.440> usually<00:03:18.799> just<00:03:18.829> average<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.430> extreme

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
it's usually just average in extreme

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.819 
it's usually just average in extreme
speed<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.120> second<00:03:20.810> game<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.200> against<00:03:21.470> crobat

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
speed so second game is against crobat
