we do to the engine here now this is a

F<00:00:46.469> -<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.550> installed<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.980> f3<00:00:50.210> 139<00:00:51.210> and

F - we have installed here a f3 139 and
so<00:00:54.750> camshaft<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.430> smaller

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so camshaft actually just take smaller

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.270 
so camshaft actually just take smaller
than<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.030> normally<00:00:57.090> would<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.920> but<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.980> was

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
than I normally would do but that was

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
than I normally would do but that was
because<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.820> were<00:00:59.910> having<00:01:01.129> built<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.430> a

because we were having built it for a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.140 
because we were having built it for a
little<00:01:02.609> smaller<00:01:02.879> blower<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> real

probably<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.590> gonna<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.430> looks<00:04:17.700> like<00:04:17.789> it's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
probably not gonna this looks like it's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.180 
probably not gonna this looks like it's
gonna<00:04:18.150> put<00:04:18.840> up<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.140> graph<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.709> actually

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
gonna put up on a graph it actually

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.640 
gonna put up on a graph it actually
would<00:04:20.340> make<00:04:20.370> more<00:04:20.789> horsepower<00:04:24.440> revving<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.530> up

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
would make more horsepower revving it up

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.140 
would make more horsepower revving it up
higher<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.400> see<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.850> entire<00:04:27.690> graph<00:04:28.080> here

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
higher you can see the entire graph here

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.540 
higher you can see the entire graph here
as<00:04:30.150> it's<00:04:30.390> still<00:04:30.630> climbing<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:31.919> line<00:04:32.160> here<00:04:32.520> is

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
as it's still climbing this line here is

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.640 
as it's still climbing this line here is
torque<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.390> is<00:04:33.570> horsepower<00:04:34.229> it's<00:04:35.070> flashing

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
torque this is horsepower it's flashing

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.050 
torque this is horsepower it's flashing
it's<00:04:37.650> definitely<00:04:38.190> pretty<00:04:38.310> aggressive<00:04:38.910> and

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
it's definitely pretty aggressive and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.840 
it's definitely pretty aggressive and
still<00:04:39.360> climbing<00:04:39.630> out<00:04:39.900> here<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:41.430> it's<00:04:41.610> gonna

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
still climbing out here but it's gonna

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.520 
still climbing out here but it's gonna
run<00:04:42.060> right<00:04:42.270> off<00:04:42.300> our<00:04:42.570> map<00:04:42.780> we<00:04:42.810> only<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.289> 3

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
run right off our map we only have a 3

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.469 
run right off our map we only have a 3
bar<00:04:43.680> map<00:04:43.919> sensor<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.400> here<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.729> he's<00:04:45.300> actually

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
bar map sensor in here and he's actually

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.659 
bar map sensor in here and he's actually
going<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.780> be<00:04:45.900> tuned<00:04:46.140> this<00:04:46.380> it's<00:04:47.280> running<00:04:47.580> in

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
going to be tuned this it's running in

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.210 
going to be tuned this it's running in
the<00:04:47.760> car<00:04:47.940> we<00:04:48.210> dynoed<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.200> with<00:04:49.320> 25<00:04:49.770> pounds<00:04:50.130> of

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
the car we dynoed it with 25 pounds of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.279 
the car we dynoed it with 25 pounds of
boost<00:04:50.340> at<00:04:51.060> 7500<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.020> makes<00:04:52.370> 1,800<00:04:53.370> horsepower

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
boost at 7500 and makes 1,800 horsepower

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.810 
boost at 7500 and makes 1,800 horsepower
so<00:04:55.789> real<00:04:56.789> nice<00:04:57.000> good<00:04:57.570> combination<00:04:57.780> good<00:04:58.350> piece

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
so real nice good combination good piece

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.550 
so real nice good combination good piece
we<00:04:59.820> can<00:04:59.970> make<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.210> small<00:05:00.630> horsepower<00:05:01.200> with<00:05:01.409> us

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
we can make a small horsepower with us

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.839 
we can make a small horsepower with us
actually<00:05:01.979> this

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
actually this

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.290 
actually this
probably<00:05:03.089> make<00:05:03.209> upwards<00:05:03.659> of<00:05:04.429> 21<00:05:05.429> a<00:05:05.819> little

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
probably make upwards of 21 a little

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.329 
probably make upwards of 21 a little
over<00:05:06.479> 20<00:05:06.719> 100<00:05:07.169> horsepower<00:05:07.439> before<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.069> starts

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
over 20 100 horsepower before it starts

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.010 
over 20 100 horsepower before it starts
nosing<00:05:08.520> over<00:05:08.939> running<00:05:09.209> out<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.599> a<00:05:09.689> little<00:05:09.899> bit

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
nosing over running out of a little bit

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.309 
nosing over running out of a little bit
of<00:05:10.169> cylinder<00:05:10.860> head<00:05:11.009> I<00:05:11.039> think<00:05:11.270> but<00:05:12.270> all<00:05:12.990> things

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
of cylinder head I think but all things

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.320 
of cylinder head I think but all things
said<00:05:13.499> and<00:05:13.559> done<00:05:13.649> this<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:13.979> real<00:05:14.159> nice<00:05:14.339> good

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
said and done this is a real nice good

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.570 
said and done this is a real nice good
combo<00:05:15.749> for<00:05:16.499> all<00:05:16.619> you<00:05:16.770> chrysler<00:05:17.159> guys<00:05:17.339> out

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
combo for all you chrysler guys out

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.109 
combo for all you chrysler guys out
