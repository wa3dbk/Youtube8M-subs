another one on there and see if you have
another<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.310> at<00:01:59.340> that<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.740> how

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
another go at that and I don't know how

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.160 
another go at that and I don't know how
long<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.100> takes<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> kill<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.360> I've<00:02:04.020> gone

long it takes to kill them but I've gone
through<00:02:04.229> about<00:02:04.439> 12<00:02:04.890> blocks<00:02:05.070> already<00:02:05.430> wait<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
through about 12 blocks already wait so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.190 
through about 12 blocks already wait so
anyway<00:02:07.950> we'll<00:02:08.129> say<00:02:08.340> alright<00:02:08.910> then

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.199 

so<00:02:12.200> anyway<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:12.829> go<00:02:12.980> rat<00:02:13.519> proofed<00:02:13.819> polytunnel

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
so anyway we go rat proofed polytunnel

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.970 
so anyway we go rat proofed polytunnel
part<00:02:14.569> -<00:02:14.810> looks<00:02:15.019> like<00:02:15.109> an<00:02:15.260> aviary<00:02:15.590> really

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.369 
part - looks like an aviary really
pigeon<00:02:16.760> loft

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
pigeon loft

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.599 
pigeon loft
they<00:02:18.379> have<00:02:18.500> really<00:02:18.680> immensely<00:02:19.159> joinery

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
they have really immensely joinery

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.369 
they have really immensely joinery
that's<00:02:20.209> what<00:02:20.359> I<00:02:20.390> had<00:02:20.510> before<00:02:20.659> to<00:02:20.930> keep<00:02:21.049> him<00:02:21.230> out

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
that's what I had before to keep him out

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.059 
that's what I had before to keep him out
like<00:02:22.219> two<00:02:22.459> foot<00:02:22.670> six<00:02:22.909> of<00:02:23.030> shiny<00:02:23.420> plastic<00:02:24.069> but

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
like two foot six of shiny plastic but

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.410 
like two foot six of shiny plastic but
one<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.549> jumped<00:02:25.849> out<00:02:25.970> at<00:02:26.090> me<00:02:26.120> just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
one that one jumped out at me just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.940
