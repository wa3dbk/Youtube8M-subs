00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.660 
tool in order to isolate the block after
the<00:02:02.180> block<00:02:02.390> has<00:02:02.570> been<00:02:02.690> isolated<00:02:03.100> then<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.400> want

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the block has been isolated then I want

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.000 
the block has been isolated then I want
to<00:02:04.790> put<00:02:05.090> four<00:02:05.660> blocks<00:02:05.930> across<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.500> documents

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
to put four blocks across the documents

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to put four blocks across the documents
so<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.130> need<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> make<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.670> block<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.910> little

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so I need to make the block a little

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.630 
so I need to make the block a little
smaller<00:02:08.510> by<00:02:09.230> grabbing<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:09.770> corner<00:02:10.040> handle

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
smaller by grabbing the corner handle

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
smaller by grabbing the corner handle
and<00:02:10.910> moving<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.360> smaller<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.110> keeps<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and moving that smaller it keeps the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.010 
and moving that smaller it keeps the
block<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.980> proportion<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.850> then<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
block in proportion and then with the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.840 
block in proportion and then with the
block<00:02:15.230> selected<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.160> copy<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
block selected that I can copy it and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.900 
block selected that I can copy it and
then<00:02:16.910> paste<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:18.110> three<00:02:18.920> times<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.430> order<00:02:19.760> to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
then paste it three times in order to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.380 
then paste it three times in order to
fit<00:02:20.360> four<00:02:20.960> blocks<00:02:21.230> across<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.830> row

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.050 

and<00:02:27.680> after<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:28.920> four<00:02:29.160> blocks<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.670> row<00:02:29.820> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and after I have four blocks in a row I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.170 
and after I have four blocks in a row I
can<00:02:30.150> select<00:02:30.690> all<00:02:30.900> four<00:02:31.170> blocks<00:02:31.700> copy<00:02:32.700> them<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
can select all four blocks copy them and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.080 
can select all four blocks copy them and
then<00:02:33.960> continue<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> paste<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.130> paste<00:02:35.520> one<00:02:35.880> row

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
then continue to paste and paste one row

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.130 
then continue to paste and paste one row
at<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.270> time<00:02:36.480> until<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> 4x4<00:02:37.740> setting

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
at a time until I have a 4x4 setting

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.040 
at a time until I have a 4x4 setting
after<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> 4x4<00:02:41.700> setting<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.870> an

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
after you have the 4x4 setting it's an

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.660 
after you have the 4x4 setting it's an
interesting<00:02:43.350> design<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.160> there's<00:02:44.340> more<00:02:44.550> that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
interesting design but there's more that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
interesting design but there's more that
can<00:02:44.820> happen<00:02:45.030> once<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.600> start<00:02:45.900> rotating<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
can happen once you start rotating the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.040 
can happen once you start rotating the
blocks<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:47.910> back<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.420> first

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
blocks so I'm going back to this first

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.230 
blocks so I'm going back to this first
row<00:02:49.380> second<00:02:50.130> block<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.580> I'm<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:50.970> select

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
row second block and I'm going to select

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.490 
row second block and I'm going to select
that<00:02:51.570> block<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:53.060> rotate<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.810> block<00:02:55.050> 90

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that block and rotate the block 90

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.690 
that block and rotate the block 90
degrees<00:02:55.800> clockwise

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.670 

then<00:03:01.300> I'm<00:03:01.690> going<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> block<00:03:02.410> below

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
then I'm going to go to the block below

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.960 
then I'm going to go to the block below
that<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.370> rotate<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.360> twice<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.790> I'm<00:03:06.790> going

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
that and rotate it twice and I'm going

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.309 
that and rotate it twice and I'm going
to<00:03:07.030> go<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.239> block<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.720> left<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:08.170> that

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
to go to the block to the left of that

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.040 
to go to the block to the left of that
one<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.800> rotate<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.519> three<00:03:09.819> times<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.450> now

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
one and rotate it three times and now

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.390 
one and rotate it three times and now
you<00:03:11.110> can<00:03:11.470> see<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.800> pinwheel<00:03:12.190> that's

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
you can see the pinwheel that's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.850 
you can see the pinwheel that's
beginning<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.879> form<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:13.510> where<00:03:14.349> those<00:03:14.530> blocks

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
beginning to form as where those blocks

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.610 
beginning to form as where those blocks
are<00:03:15.040> meeting<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.720> next<00:03:16.870> thing<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.200> do<00:03:17.319> is<00:03:17.349> to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
are meeting the next thing to do is to

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.979 
are meeting the next thing to do is to
continue<00:03:18.010> repeating<00:03:18.849> blocks<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.690> same

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
continue repeating blocks in that same

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.930 
continue repeating blocks in that same
pattern<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:20.709> order<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.430> get<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> overall

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
pattern in order to get the overall

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.180 
pattern in order to get the overall
design<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.209> can<00:03:25.480> open<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.840> new<00:03:25.870> document

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
design then I can open a new document

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.729 
design then I can open a new document
drag<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> photo<00:03:27.610> on<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:27.880> second<00:03:28.420> time<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.900> now

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
drag the photo on a second time and now

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.589 
drag the photo on a second time and now
I'm<00:03:30.010> going<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> isolate<00:03:30.459> block<00:03:30.970> number<00:03:31.330> four

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
I'm going to isolate block number four

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.750 
I'm going to isolate block number four
and<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.170> all<00:03:32.319> for<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.620> same<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.370> same<00:03:33.610> way<00:03:33.730> I

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and it's all for the same the same way I

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.660 
and it's all for the same the same way I
did<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> first<00:03:34.239> one<00:03:35.040> drag<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.190> photo<00:03:36.489> in

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
did the first one drag the photo in

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.229 
did the first one drag the photo in
place

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
place

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.420 
place
select<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.989> photo<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.099> format

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
select the photo go to the format

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.210 
select the photo go to the format
picture<00:03:39.610> tab<00:03:40.030> select<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.170> crop<00:03:41.470> photo<00:03:41.829> and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
picture tab select on crop photo and

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.009 
picture tab select on crop photo and
this<00:03:42.549> time<00:03:42.790> I'm<00:03:42.910> isolating<00:03:43.450> block<00:03:43.690> number

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
this time I'm isolating block number

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.289 
this time I'm isolating block number
four<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.769> it's<00:03:44.980> okay<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.790> inside<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
four and it's okay to go just inside the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.759 
four and it's okay to go just inside the
edges<00:03:46.599> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.810> block<00:03:47.049> because<00:03:47.530> as<00:03:47.680> you

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
edges of the block because as you

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.770 
edges of the block because as you
remember<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:48.370> now<00:03:48.579> would<00:03:49.269> account<00:03:49.510> for<00:03:49.630> the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
remember this now would account for the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.750 
remember this now would account for the
seam<00:03:50.019> allowance<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.709> you're<00:03:51.190> covering

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
seam allowance so that you're covering

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.789 
seam allowance so that you're covering
up<00:03:51.940> all<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.269> raw<00:03:52.569> edges<00:03:52.599> of<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.140> block<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
up all the raw edges of the block and

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.199 
up all the raw edges of the block and
you<00:03:54.280> want<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.519> make<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.880> square<00:03:55.060> as

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
you want to make it as square as

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.479 
you want to make it as square as
possible<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.500> repeat<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.250> and

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
possible so that you can repeat it and

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.550 
possible so that you can repeat it and
maintain<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:57.880> square<00:03:58.299> as<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.630> do<00:03:59.200> your<00:03:59.349> 4x4

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
maintain that square as you do your 4x4

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.949 
maintain that square as you do your 4x4
setting<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:00.880> again<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.180> just<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.630> make<00:04:01.810> it

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
setting and so again I just I make it

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.710 
setting and so again I just I make it
smaller<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.739> select<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.610> copy<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.450> and

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
smaller and I select it copy it and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840 
smaller and I select it copy it and
paste<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.799> continue<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.310> repeat<00:04:06.700> that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
paste it and continue to repeat that

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.240 
paste it and continue to repeat that
until<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.239> have<00:04:07.389> a<00:04:07.420> row<00:04:07.690> once<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> row<00:04:09.220> I

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
until I have a row once I have a row I

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.240 
until I have a row once I have a row I
select<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> entire<00:04:10.209> row<00:04:10.620> copy<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.160> then

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
select the entire row copy that and then

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.890 
select the entire row copy that and then
paste<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.850> rows<00:04:13.000> until<00:04:13.329> I<00:04:13.359> have<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.690> full

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
paste the rows until I have the full

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.140 
paste the rows until I have the full
design<00:04:14.190> again<00:04:15.190> I'm<00:04:15.340> going<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.579> rotate<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
design again I'm going to rotate the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.479 
design again I'm going to rotate the
blocks<00:04:16.419> until<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:17.500> have<00:04:17.769> in<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.039> case<00:04:18.100> two

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
blocks until I have in this case two

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.699 
blocks until I have in this case two
rows<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:19.060> blocks<00:04:19.150> done<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.870> can<00:04:20.410> get<00:04:20.530> rid<00:04:20.680> of

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
rows of blocks done I can get rid of

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.820 
rows of blocks done I can get rid of
those<00:04:21.030> rows<00:04:22.030> three<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.479> four<00:04:22.780> now<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.560> can

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
those rows three and four now I can

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.180 
those rows three and four now I can
select<00:04:24.100> these<00:04:24.340> two<00:04:24.940> rows<00:04:25.680> copy<00:04:26.680> them<00:04:26.979> and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
select these two rows copy them and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.610 
select these two rows copy them and
paste<00:04:27.280> them<00:04:27.880> without<00:04:28.660> having<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.020> rotate<00:04:29.169> each

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
paste them without having to rotate each

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.469 
paste them without having to rotate each
and<00:04:29.800> every<00:04:29.979> block<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.610> will<00:04:30.789> help<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.060> get<00:04:31.180> a

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
and every block that will help you get a

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.480 
and every block that will help you get a
little<00:04:31.780> further<00:04:31.960> along<00:04:32.139> now<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.039> can<00:04:33.310> see

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
little further along now you can see

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360 
little further along now you can see
I've<00:04:33.639> got<00:04:33.850> all<00:04:34.060> four<00:04:34.120> blocks<00:04:35.220> rotated<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.340> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
I've got all four blocks rotated in the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.029 
I've got all four blocks rotated in the
same<00:04:36.669> setting<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.900> subtle<00:04:38.440> differences

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
same setting and the subtle differences

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.440 
same setting and the subtle differences
that<00:04:39.250> you're<00:04:39.370> seeing<00:04:39.610> between<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.210> blocks

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
that you're seeing between the blocks

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.390 
that you're seeing between the blocks
are<00:04:40.810> because<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.410> different<00:04:41.740> positions

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
are because of the different positions

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.790 
are because of the different positions
of<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.669> fabric<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.229> decide<00:04:44.530> do

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
of the fabric and so you can decide do

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.379 
of the fabric and so you can decide do
you<00:04:44.830> want<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.310> stronger<00:04:45.580> pinwheel<00:04:46.060> or<00:04:46.360> a

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
you want a stronger pinwheel or a

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.180 
you want a stronger pinwheel or a
lighter<00:04:46.690> pinwheel<00:04:47.139> there's<00:04:47.740> no<00:04:47.950> right<00:04:48.160> or

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
lighter pinwheel there's no right or

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.730 
lighter pinwheel there's no right or
wrong<00:04:48.340> answer<00:04:48.789> in<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:49.720> case<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.229> chose<00:04:50.440> block

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
wrong answer in this case I chose block

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.200 
wrong answer in this case I chose block
number<00:04:51.039> two<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> block<00:04:51.729> that's<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.150> to

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
number two is the block that's going to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.150 
number two is the block that's going to
be<00:04:52.330> sewn<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:53.169> other<00:04:53.289> thing<00:04:53.590> though<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.979> that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
be sewn the other thing though is that

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.159 
be sewn the other thing though is that
you<00:04:54.250> don't<00:04:54.490> have<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.970> rotate<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.780> same<00:04:56.020> way

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
you don't have to rotate the same way

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.080 
you don't have to rotate the same way
that<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.380> did<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:57.400> can<00:04:57.580> begin<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.940> rotate

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
that I did you can begin to rotate

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.510 
that I did you can begin to rotate
blocks<00:04:58.510> in<00:04:58.690> any<00:04:58.840> pattern<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.440> want<00:04:59.590> here

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
blocks in any pattern that you want here

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.670 
blocks in any pattern that you want here
I<00:05:00.580> rotated<00:05:01.150> every<00:05:01.539> other<00:05:01.660> block<00:05:02.020> just<00:05:02.349> once

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
I rotated every other block just once

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.710 
I rotated every other block just once
and<00:05:03.130> then<00:05:03.400> repeated<00:05:03.849> those<00:05:04.030> rows<00:05:04.300> for<00:05:04.690> a

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
and then repeated those rows for a

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.629 
and then repeated those rows for a
different<00:05:05.080> design<00:05:05.349> now<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.039> see<00:05:06.310> three

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
different design now you see three

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.700 
different design now you see three
different<00:05:06.820> layouts<00:05:07.419> where<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.260> blocks<00:05:08.500> are

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
different layouts where the blocks are

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.620 
different layouts where the blocks are
rotated<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.340> different<00:05:09.669> directions<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:10.270> order

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
rotated in different directions in order

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.900 
rotated in different directions in order
get<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:10.990> them<00:05:11.140> with<00:05:11.740> these<00:05:11.920> simple<00:05:12.250> tools<00:05:12.550> a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
digital camera in Word you can audition

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.370 
digital camera in Word you can audition
fabric<00:05:15.730> in<00:05:16.210> your<00:05:16.270> in<00:05:16.600> different<00:05:16.930> positions<00:05:17.260> in

fabric in your in different positions in

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.290 
fabric in your in different positions in
your<00:05:17.500> block<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.100> then<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.490> can<00:05:18.730> also<00:05:18.880> take<00:05:19.150> it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
your block and then you can also take it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.460 
your block and then you can also take it
a<00:05:19.360> step<00:05:19.570> further<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.990> try<00:05:20.410> different

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
a step further and try different

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.020 
a step further and try different
settings<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.280> come<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.730> with<00:05:21.820> your<00:05:21.970> own
