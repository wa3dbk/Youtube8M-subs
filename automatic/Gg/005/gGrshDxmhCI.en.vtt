00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
over the fact of whether I would go

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.509 
over the fact of whether I would go
ahead<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.170> shave<00:00:47.440> my<00:00:47.469> whole<00:00:47.800> head<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.100> wear

wigs or just wear headbands and hats to

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.110 
wigs or just wear headbands and hats to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
cover it up for the next year until it

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.119 
cover it up for the next year until it
grew<00:00:55.329> back<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.899> didn't<00:00:56.739> really<00:00:56.920> know<00:00:57.100> that

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
grew back I didn't really know that

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.729 
grew back I didn't really know that
there<00:00:57.399> was<00:00:57.519> an<00:00:57.670> in-between<00:00:58.260> option<00:00:59.260> until<00:00:59.710> I

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
there was an in-between option until I

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.400 
there was an in-between option until I
really<00:01:00.100> started<00:01:00.429> doing<00:01:00.489> some<00:01:00.910> research<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.379> I

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
really started doing some research so I

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
saw that they had hair pieces and I

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.480

what my hair looks like without the
hairpiece<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.000> can<00:01:22.090> kind<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.330> get<00:01:22.450> an

hairpiece on so you can kind of get an

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.360 
hairpiece on so you can kind of get an
idea<00:01:22.690> because<00:01:23.260> like<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> said<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.830> didn't<00:01:24.220> know

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
idea because like I said I didn't know

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.790 
idea because like I said I didn't know
that<00:01:25.210> there<00:01:25.390> was<00:01:25.480> an<00:01:25.600> option<00:01:25.750> for<00:01:26.410> someone<00:01:26.680> who

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
that there was an option for someone who

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.580 
that there was an option for someone who
just<00:01:26.830> had<00:01:27.190> an<00:01:28.120> area<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.720> hair<00:01:28.900> loss<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.320> not

just had an area of hair loss and not

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.890 
just had an area of hair loss and not
their<00:01:29.770> entire<00:01:30.070> hair<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.360> I'll<00:01:31.450> go<00:01:31.570> ahead<00:01:31.600> and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
their entire hair so I'll go ahead and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
their entire hair so I'll go ahead and
show<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.290> now

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
show you that now

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.090 
show you that now
okay<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:33.910> I've<00:01:34.180> already<00:01:34.650> undone<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.830> clips

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
okay so I've already undone the clips

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.900 
okay so I've already undone the clips
and<00:01:37.950> unstuck<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:38.980> tape<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.520> front<00:01:39.640> just

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
and unstuck the tape on the front just

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.580 
and unstuck the tape on the front just
so<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.270> take<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.540> off<00:01:40.630> pretty<00:01:40.780> easily<00:01:40.990> it

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
so I can take it off pretty easily it

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.460 
so I can take it off pretty easily it
does<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.010> come<00:01:42.250> off<00:01:42.340> easily<00:01:43.260> as<00:01:44.260> I'll<00:01:44.440> show

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
does not come off easily as I'll show

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.860 
does not come off easily as I'll show
you<00:01:44.680> in<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.310> few<00:01:45.460> minutes<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:47.880> comes<00:01:48.880> up<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
you in a few minutes but comes up and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.430 
you in a few minutes but comes up and
then<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.680> this<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.550> hair<00:01:51.790> loss<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.210> had<00:01:52.630> from

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
then so this is the hair loss I had from

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.700 
then so this is the hair loss I had from
radiation<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.340> my<00:01:54.550> options<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:55.390> thought<00:01:55.930> were

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
radiation so my options I thought were

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.130 
radiation so my options I thought were
to<00:01:56.830> either<00:01:56.920> shave<00:01:57.250> my<00:01:57.430> whole<00:01:57.580> head<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.120> get<00:01:59.110> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
to either shave my whole head and get a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.660 
to either shave my whole head and get a
full<00:01:59.380> wig<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:01.320> wear<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> headband<00:02:02.800> which<00:02:03.550> I

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
full wig or to wear a headband which I

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
of been playing with it learning how to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.930 
of been playing with it learning how to
do<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
do it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
do it
um<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:38.010> been<00:03:38.040> pretty<00:03:38.280> easy<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.730> first

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
um it's been pretty easy the first

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.430 
um it's been pretty easy the first
couple<00:03:39.240> times<00:03:39.360> there<00:03:39.720> was<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:40.140> bit<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.350> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
couple times there was a little bit of a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
couple times there was a little bit of a
learning<00:03:40.650> curve<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.610> didn't<00:03:42.450> really<00:03:42.660> start

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
learning curve but I didn't really start

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.750 
learning curve but I didn't really start
on<00:03:43.020> my<00:03:43.140> own<00:03:43.260> hair<00:03:43.470> very<00:03:43.680> much<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.400> kind<00:03:44.670> of

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
on my own hair very much so it kind of

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.090 
on my own hair very much so it kind of
took<00:03:45.360> me<00:03:45.540> probably<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.440> little<00:03:46.530> bit<00:03:46.709> longer<00:03:46.890> to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
took me probably a little bit longer to

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.340 
took me probably a little bit longer to
learn<00:03:47.250> how<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.459> style<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.000> one<00:03:48.110> but<00:03:49.110> I've<00:03:49.200> had

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
learn how to style this one but I've had

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.630 
learn how to style this one but I've had
