00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.780 
the power Jersey makes otk is incredible
next<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.689> one<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.369> one

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
next we have one but back a bit one

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.080 
next we have one but back a bit one
block<00:02:00.060> backer<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.430> don't<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> him<00:02:02.790> too<00:02:02.939> much

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
block backer I don't like him too much

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.760 
block backer I don't like him too much
he's<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> goalkeeper<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
he's kind of like a goalkeeper he and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.190 
he's kind of like a goalkeeper he and
there's<00:02:04.920> less<00:02:05.159> defense<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.729> them<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.170> what<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
there's less defense in them but what a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
there's less defense in them but what a
monster<00:02:07.530> something<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> change<00:02:08.550> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
monster something you can change this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.249 
monster something you can change this
defense<00:02:09.030> position<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> negate<00:02:09.810> its<00:02:09.989> effect

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
defense position and negate its effect

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
defense position and negate its effect
so<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.560> good<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.039> light<00:02:11.160> constructs<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so it's good for light constructs and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
so it's good for light constructs and
stuff<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.170> lot<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
stuff because you do have a lot of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.030 
stuff because you do have a lot of
special<00:02:13.800> someone

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.640

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
like he's fine at one and doesn't do

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.679 
like he's fine at one and doesn't do

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
that doesn't do too much to like

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.289 
that doesn't do too much to like
adventure<00:02:22.260> game<00:02:22.439> say<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.069> much<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:24.150> very
