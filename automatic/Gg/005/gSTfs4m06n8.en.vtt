uh I do have the other parody cases

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.889 
uh I do have the other parody cases
listed<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> info<00:00:31.880> just<00:00:32.880> click<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.420> it

either write me email leave me a comment
do<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> video<00:00:46.170> response<00:00:46.579> I'll<00:00:47.579> uh<00:00:48.260> I'll<00:00:49.260> fix<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
do a video response I'll uh I'll fix it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.910 
do a video response I'll uh I'll fix it
make<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:53.329> believe<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
make it right so I believe this is the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
make it right so I believe this is the
parody<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.430> he<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.730> talking<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
parody case that he was talking about a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.009 
parody case that he was talking about a
single<00:00:58.260> wedge<00:00:58.440> flipped<00:01:00.469> two<00:01:01.730> edges<00:01:03.019> obviously

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
single wedge flipped two edges obviously

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.130 
single wedge flipped two edges obviously
make<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.739> wedge<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.140> one

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
make up one wedge so this is the one

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.490 
make up one wedge so this is the one
wedge<00:01:07.380> case<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> case<00:01:09.000> number<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
wedge case which is case number two in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.570 
wedge case which is case number two in
the<00:01:11.159> info<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:14.549> uh

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the info you want to look at that but uh

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
the info you want to look at that but uh
and<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> hold<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> with

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and this is how you do it hold it with

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
and this is how you do it hold it with
the<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.259> wedge<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.830> incorrect<00:01:20.369> facing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the the wedge that's incorrect facing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.070 
the the wedge that's incorrect facing
you<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.830> hold<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.869> all

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
you as you can see hold on it's all

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.210 
you as you can see hold on it's all
solved<00:01:25.670> except<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
solved except for just that one so it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.149 
solved except for just that one so it's
easier<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> solve<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.530> all<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.070> at

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
easier if you solve it all of it or at

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
easier if you solve it all of it or at
least<00:01:32.220> most<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
least most you can and then do it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
least most you can and then do it
because<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.100> you're<00:01:35.220> done<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because then when you're done with the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.780 
because then when you're done with the
algorithm<00:01:36.530> everything<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.740> nice<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.430> pretty

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
algorithm everything is nice and pretty

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.140 
algorithm everything is nice and pretty
back<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.820> should<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
back to the way you should have it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.410 
back to the way you should have it
anyway<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
anyway so this is how you do it it's to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.790 
anyway so this is how you do it it's to
our<00:01:45.750> star

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.390 

to<00:01:49.430> back

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.260 

okay<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.300> didn't<00:01:58.480> see<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.970> back

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.620 

to<00:02:05.869> up

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.950 

there's<00:02:13.630> one<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.700> two

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.780 

left<00:02:19.740> star<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:24.000> up

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:38.100 

our<00:02:27.269> star<00:02:27.780> prime<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:31.049> up

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.980 

our<00:02:38.710> star

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:55.600 

to<00:02:42.590> up<00:02:42.860> again<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:48.740> front

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.690 

right<00:02:56.570> star

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:11.070 

to<00:03:01.330> front<00:03:01.720> again<00:03:04.709> L<00:03:05.709> star<00:03:06.700> prime

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.250 

to<00:03:11.820> back

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.740 

to<00:03:17.920> write<00:03:18.879> star<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:20.549> as<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.879> see<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.480> did

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
to write star and as you can see it did

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.119 
to write star and as you can see it did
flip<00:03:23.049> these<00:03:23.230> two<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.569> fixed<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:29.129> the

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
flip these two but it fixed the the

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.819 
flip these two but it fixed the the
parity<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:30.819> had<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.959> now<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.110> got<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
parity that we had so now I got to do is

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.160 
parity that we had so now I got to do is
fix<00:03:33.189> those<00:03:33.459> two<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.239> fix<00:03:34.540> everything<00:03:34.840> else

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
fix those two and fix everything else

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:59.390 
fix those two and fix everything else
and<00:03:36.120> you'll<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.239> good

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.729 

we<00:03:59.970> actually<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:02.750> two<00:04:03.750> more<00:04:03.989> parity<00:04:04.290> cases

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
we actually have two more parity cases

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.559 
we actually have two more parity cases
here<00:04:05.569> if<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:06.720> can<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:08.450> opposite<00:04:09.450> and

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
here if you can see opposite and

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:19.210 
here if you can see opposite and
opposite<00:04:13.579> that's<00:04:14.579> actually<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:16.820> parody<00:04:17.820> case

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
opposite that's actually a parody case

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.409 
opposite that's actually a parody case
number<00:04:22.190> three<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.370> believe<00:04:23.460> because<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.270> one

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
number three I believe because the one

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.790 
number three I believe because the one
we<00:04:24.539> just<00:04:24.570> did<00:04:24.810> was<00:04:25.080> parody<00:04:25.350> case<00:04:25.500> number<00:04:25.770> two

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
we just did was parody case number two

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.270 
we just did was parody case number two
so<00:04:28.800> yeah<00:04:29.400> prepare<00:04:30.090> your<00:04:30.180> case<00:04:30.270> number<00:04:30.330> three

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.070 

actually<00:04:37.460> actually<00:04:38.460> no<00:04:38.639> it's<00:04:38.820> not<00:04:39.000> parody<00:04:39.449> my

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
actually actually no it's not parody my

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.650 
actually actually no it's not parody my
mistake<00:04:40.460> because<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:41.789> switch<00:04:42.090> these<00:04:42.360> two<00:04:42.419> I

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
mistake because I can switch these two I

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.029 
mistake because I can switch these two I
don't<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.810> see<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.050> switch<00:04:46.919> these<00:04:47.100> two<00:04:49.039> and

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
don't you see that switch these two and

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:57.420 
don't you see that switch these two and
a<00:04:50.190> stew<00:04:50.840> with<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:52.050> algorithm<00:04:52.410> here

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.740 

dang<00:04:58.430> i<00:04:58.850> always<00:04:59.120> forget<00:04:59.270> how<00:04:59.420> to<00:04:59.540> do<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.900> oh

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
dang i always forget how to do that oh

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:27.330 
dang i always forget how to do that oh
yeah<00:05:02.750> like<00:05:02.960> this

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.180 

check<00:05:28.340> out<00:05:28.729> those<00:05:28.970> fixed<00:05:29.710> now<00:05:30.710> we<00:05:30.770> just<00:05:31.009> got<00:05:31.160> to

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
check out those fixed now we just got to

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.700 
check out those fixed now we just got to
rotate<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.759> corners<00:05:32.270> which<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.930> in<00:05:33.319> this

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
rotate the corners which is in this

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:52.839 
rotate the corners which is in this
direction<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:35.330> we<00:05:35.360> go<00:05:37.690> like<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:51.849> parity

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
direction so we go like this and parity

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.529 
direction so we go like this and parity
solved<00:05:53.470> so<00:05:54.470> that's<00:05:54.680> how<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:54.889> do<00:05:55.099> the<00:05:55.539> single

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
solved so that's how you do the single

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:04.870 
solved so that's how you do the single
wedge<00:05:57.340> parity<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:03.069> person<00:06:04.069> that<00:06:04.099> asked<00:06:04.550> me<00:06:04.699> to

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
wedge parity the person that asked me to

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.710 
wedge parity the person that asked me to
do<00:06:05.060> this<00:06:05.710> if<00:06:06.710> you<00:06:06.860> have<00:06:07.009> any<00:06:07.099> questions<00:06:07.720> just

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
do this if you have any questions just

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.350 
do this if you have any questions just
text<00:06:08.960> me<00:06:09.199> I'll<00:06:09.620> figure<00:06:09.889> it<00:06:10.009> out<00:06:10.720> and<00:06:13.180> all<00:06:14.180> right

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
text me I'll figure it out and all right

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.060 
text me I'll figure it out and all right
that's<00:06:15.259> it<00:06:15.440> for<00:06:15.500> this<00:06:15.710> tutorial<00:06:16.060> enjoy
