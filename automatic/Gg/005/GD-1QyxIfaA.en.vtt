cut and paste it to my desktop you
folder<00:03:09.000> make<00:03:09.239> sure<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.510> put<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> new

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
folder make sure you put it in a new

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.379 
folder make sure you put it in a new
folder<00:03:10.230> because<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.920> makes<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.190> bunch<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.489> piles

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.559 

now<00:03:15.389> I'll<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.709> paste<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.549> there<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.910> then

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
now I'll just paste it in there and then

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:34.390 
now I'll just paste it in there and then
running<00:03:24.709> it'll<00:03:25.709> generate<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:26.160> new<00:03:26.459> world

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.920 

now<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.610> screen<00:03:35.909> should<00:03:36.090> pop<00:03:36.269> up<00:03:36.300> usually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
now this screen should pop up usually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.960 
now this screen should pop up usually
has<00:03:37.170> texture<00:03:37.769> I'm<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:38.069> sure<00:03:38.250> why<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.459> doesn't

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
has texture I'm not sure why it doesn't

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
has texture I'm not sure why it doesn't
but<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.120> seems<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.599> works<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
but it seems it works you can see the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.009 
but it seems it works you can see the
folder<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.129> made<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.640> bunch<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.180> new<00:03:42.330> files<00:03:42.659> are

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
folder you made a bunch of new files are

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.500 
folder you made a bunch of new files are
in<00:03:43.140> there<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.250> server<00:03:44.670> properties<00:03:45.360> this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
in there so just server properties this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.289 
in there so just server properties this
is<00:03:45.569> probably<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.230> most<00:03:46.379> important<00:03:47.159> and<00:03:47.340> you

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
is probably the most important and you

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.910 
is probably the most important and you
can<00:03:48.330> see<00:03:48.659> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.930> open<00:03:49.200> up<00:03:49.290> your<00:03:49.440> Minecraft

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920

client and then refresh it and you type

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.710 
client and then refresh it and you type
in<00:03:55.200> localhost<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:56.040> should<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.459> your<00:03:57.390> server

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
in localhost it should be your server

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390
