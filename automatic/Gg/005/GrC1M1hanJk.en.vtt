8th<00:00:04.589> 2010<00:00:05.930> can't<00:00:06.930> really<00:00:07.080> believe<00:00:07.350> the

8th 2010 can't really believe the
weather<00:00:07.680> we've<00:00:07.950> been<00:00:07.980> having<00:00:08.130> haven't<00:00:08.910> hardly

weather we've been having haven't hardly
had<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:10.849> single<00:00:12.080> snowfall<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.170> entire<00:00:13.500> winter

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
had a single snowfall this entire winter

had a single snowfall this entire winter
and<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.519> certainly<00:00:14.759> doesn't<00:00:14.969> feel<00:00:15.120> like

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and it certainly doesn't feel like

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.370 
and it certainly doesn't feel like
winter<00:00:15.420> right<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.430> my

I'll<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> doing<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.949> couple<00:00:29.250> months<00:00:29.630> looks

I'll be doing in a couple months looks

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.319 
I'll be doing in a couple months looks
like<00:00:30.779> we're<00:00:30.960> having<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.230> early<00:00:31.349> spring<00:00:32.329> it's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like we're having an early spring it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.700 
like we're having an early spring it's
too<00:00:33.540> bad<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> Olympics<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
too bad for the Olympics which is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549 
too bad for the Olympics which is
happening<00:00:34.890> next<00:00:35.280> week<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:36.410> round<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
happening next week just round the

corner

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
corner
I<00:00:38.180> don't<00:00:39.180> think<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.540> happy<00:00:39.989> about

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I don't think they're very happy about

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.250 
I don't think they're very happy about
it<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> rest<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> continents<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> deep

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it the rest of the continents and a deep

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.880 
it the rest of the continents and a deep
freeze<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.040> BC<00:00:44.219> were<00:00:45.590> 14<00:00:46.590> degrees

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
freeze in here in BC were 14 degrees

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.850 
freeze in here in BC were 14 degrees
above<00:00:47.510> Celsius<00:00:48.920> anyways<00:00:51.140> where<00:00:52.140> does<00:00:52.320> silver

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
above Celsius anyways where does silver

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
above Celsius anyways where does silver
come<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> reason<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> camera

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
come from the reason I have the camera

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
come from the reason I have the camera
aimed<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> sky<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:58.859> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
aimed at the sky is because that is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
aimed at the sky is because that is
where<00:00:59.309> silver<00:00:59.670> comes<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:01.460> not<00:01:02.510> any

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
where silver comes from not any

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.560 
where silver comes from not any
particular<00:01:04.909> god<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.150> gods<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.740> humans

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
particular god or gods that as humans

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.700 
particular god or gods that as humans
tend<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.000> from<00:01:12.000> stars<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:13.530> our

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
tend to make up but from stars like our

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
tend to make up but from stars like our
own<00:01:13.770> Sun<00:01:13.939> this<00:01:14.939> may<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.689> review

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
own Sun this may be a bit of a review

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
own Sun this may be a bit of a review
for<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> people<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.520> some

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
for a lot of people but I think some

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.800 
for a lot of people but I think some
people<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.220> every<00:01:20.600> atom<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
people don't know this every atom of

people don't know this every atom of

history of the universe about 14 billion
years<00:01:34.290> ago<00:01:34.549> yes<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.180> calculate<00:01:36.479> exactly

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
years ago yes we can calculate exactly

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.670 
years ago yes we can calculate exactly
when<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> began<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:39.119> present<00:01:39.990> universe<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
when it began the present universe as we

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.810 
when it began the present universe as we
know<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.240> originated<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.820> very

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
know it originated from a point of very

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780 
know it originated from a point of very
high<00:01:45.270> amounts<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.140> energy<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.829> mass<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.399> one

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
high amounts of energy and mass in one

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.600 
high amounts of energy and mass in one
spot<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.430> has<00:01:50.430> since<00:01:50.729> been<00:01:50.970> spreading<00:01:51.479> itself

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
spot and has since been spreading itself

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.749 
spot and has since been spreading itself
thinner<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:54.329> throughout<00:01:55.520> space<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
thinner over time throughout space I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.380 
thinner over time throughout space I
guess<00:01:56.790> you'd<00:01:57.090> say<00:01:57.409> all<00:01:58.939> molecules<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> they

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
guess you'd say all molecules and they

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.260 
guess you'd say all molecules and they
believe<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.409> hydrogen<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> helium

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
believe it was just hydrogen and helium

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.050 
believe it was just hydrogen and helium
originally<00:02:05.750> are<00:02:06.750> spreading<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:08.099> some

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
areas there's almost no matter

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.690 
areas there's almost no matter
and<00:02:11.689> you'd<00:02:12.650> call<00:02:12.829> that<00:02:12.859> empty<00:02:13.189> space<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.609> in

and you'd call that empty space and in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.069 
and you'd call that empty space and in
some<00:02:13.879> areas<00:02:13.909> there<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.540> little<00:02:14.810> bit<00:02:14.900> more

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
some areas there is a little bit more

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.989 
some areas there is a little bit more

of matter in one spot and that's because

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.649

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.080 
the universe no matter how far away it

great<00:02:32.870> big<00:02:33.519> balls<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.819> matter<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:35.450> it

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
great big balls of matter because it

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.720 
great big balls of matter because it
well<00:02:36.139> because<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.500> gravity<00:02:36.859> and<00:02:37.010> when<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:37.639> get

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
well because of gravity and when you get

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.670 
well because of gravity and when you get
that<00:02:37.879> much<00:02:38.090> matter<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.480> one<00:02:38.659> spot<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.290> starts

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
that much matter in one spot it starts

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.050 
that much matter in one spot it starts
to<00:02:39.799> press<00:02:40.040> against<00:02:40.400> each<00:02:40.489> other<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.969> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
to press against each other and it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.729 
to press against each other and it
starts<00:02:41.359> to<00:02:41.480> crush<00:02:41.719> each<00:02:41.870> other<00:02:42.079> and<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.499> starts

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
starts to crush each other and it starts

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.069 
starts to crush each other and it starts
to<00:02:42.859> heat<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:43.069> especially<00:02:43.849> towards<00:02:44.719> the<00:02:44.780> middle

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
to heat up especially towards the middle

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.649 
to heat up especially towards the middle
of<00:02:45.169> these<00:02:45.319> large<00:02:45.590> blobs<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.669> that's<00:02:47.450> what

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
of these large blobs and that's what

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.589 
of these large blobs and that's what
happens<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.650> stars<00:02:48.950> eventually<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.359> matter

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
happens to stars eventually the matter

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.319 
happens to stars eventually the matter
which<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.989> originally<00:02:51.919> was<00:02:52.069> just<00:02:52.239> helium<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
which is originally was just helium and

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.990 
which is originally was just helium and
hydrogen<00:02:53.829> got<00:02:54.829> hot<00:02:55.040> enough<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.489> then<00:02:55.699> it

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
hydrogen got hot enough and then it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.240 
hydrogen got hot enough and then it
turned<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.409> other<00:02:57.590> words<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:57.980> became<00:02:58.219> a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
turned on in other words it became a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.610 
turned on in other words it became a
star<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.790> started<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.239> glow<00:02:59.359> and<00:02:59.719> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
star and it started to glow and it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.409 
star and it started to glow and it
started<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.549> reason<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:01.909> glowing<00:03:02.150> is

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
started to the reason it's glowing is

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.929 
started to the reason it's glowing is
because<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.019> is<00:03:03.169> a<00:03:03.409> nuclear<00:03:04.099> reaction<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.699> very

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
because it is a nuclear reaction a very

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.300 
because it is a nuclear reaction a very
very<00:03:05.299> large<00:03:06.019> nuclear<00:03:06.650> reaction<00:03:07.159> that's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
very large nuclear reaction that's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.339 
very large nuclear reaction that's
taking<00:03:07.639> place<00:03:07.669> and<00:03:08.120> continues<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.139> take<00:03:09.199> place

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
taking place and continues to take place

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.439 
taking place and continues to take place
there's<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.040> much<00:03:10.219> helium<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.849> hydrogen<00:03:11.180> up

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:11.449 
there's so much helium and hydrogen up

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.689 
there's so much helium and hydrogen up
in<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.689> Sun<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.199> our<00:03:12.319> Sun<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.549> been

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:13.699 
in the Sun in our Sun that it's been

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.420 
in the Sun in our Sun that it's been
burning<00:03:13.909> for<00:03:14.799> millions<00:03:15.799> of<00:03:15.919> years<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.250> it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
burning for millions of years and it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.119 
burning for millions of years and it
will<00:03:16.519> continue<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:17.060> do<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.799> very<00:03:19.040> very

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
will continue to do so for a very very

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.520 
will continue to do so for a very very
very<00:03:19.519> very<00:03:19.699> long<00:03:20.120> time<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.780> come<00:03:20.930> before<00:03:21.319> it

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
very very long time to come before it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.089 
very very long time to come before it
even<00:03:21.739> starts<00:03:22.159> to<00:03:22.280> run<00:03:22.459> out<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.639> fuel<00:03:22.909> so<00:03:24.099> in

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
even starts to run out of fuel so in

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.830 
even starts to run out of fuel so in
these<00:03:25.310> nuclear<00:03:25.699> reactions<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.299> hydrogen<00:03:26.780> and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
these nuclear reactions the hydrogen and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.349 
these nuclear reactions the hydrogen and
helium<00:03:27.049> which<00:03:27.889> are<00:03:28.099> very<00:03:28.280> very<00:03:28.459> simple<00:03:28.970> atoms

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
helium which are very very simple atoms

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.399 
helium which are very very simple atoms
just<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:30.099> proton<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.400> neutron<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.970> a

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
just a proton and a neutron and a

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.080 
just a proton and a neutron and a
electron<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.489> depending<00:03:34.819> on<00:03:34.879> if<00:03:35.000> you're

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
electron the depending on if you're

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.039 
electron the depending on if you're
talking<00:03:35.209> about<00:03:35.389> hydrogen<00:03:35.750> or<00:03:35.900> helium

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
talking about hydrogen or helium

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.740 
talking about hydrogen or helium
hydrogen<00:03:36.829> doesn't<00:03:37.189> have<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> neutron<00:03:37.849> but

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
hydrogen doesn't have a neutron but

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.659 
hydrogen doesn't have a neutron but
anyways<00:03:40.569> these<00:03:41.569> three<00:03:41.870> simple<00:03:43.120> particles

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
anyways these three simple particles

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.909 
anyways these three simple particles
electrons<00:03:46.669> protons<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.479> neutrons<00:03:47.919> combine

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
electrons protons and neutrons combine

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.460 
electrons protons and neutrons combine
together<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.000> form<00:03:50.180> every<00:03:50.930> bit<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.169> matter

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
together to form every bit of matter

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.100 
together to form every bit of matter
that<00:03:51.590> exists

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
that exists

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.449 
that exists
this<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.200> gonna<00:03:55.319> be<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> long<00:03:55.650> video<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.159> tell

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
this is gonna be a long video I can tell

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.110 
this is gonna be a long video I can tell
hmm<00:03:58.220> anyhow<00:04:00.379> inside<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.560> star<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.549> process

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
hmm anyhow inside the star that process

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.759 
hmm anyhow inside the star that process
continues<00:04:03.659> through<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> life<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.440> star

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
continues through the life of the star

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.800 
continues through the life of the star
and<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.099> converting<00:04:05.610> hydrogen<00:04:06.060> into<00:04:06.510> helium

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
and it's converting hydrogen into helium

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.520 
and it's converting hydrogen into helium
for<00:04:07.349> example<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.030> into<00:04:09.049> slightly<00:04:10.049> heavier

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
for example and into slightly heavier

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.890 
for example and into slightly heavier
elements<00:04:11.099> eventually<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:12.239> star<00:04:12.480> runs<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.780> of

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
elements eventually the star runs out of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.830 
elements eventually the star runs out of
the<00:04:12.989> hydrogen<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.560> helium<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.190> starts<00:04:14.580> to

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
the hydrogen and helium and it starts to

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.520 
the hydrogen and helium and it starts to
combine<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.620> helium<00:04:17.400> atoms<00:04:17.729> together<00:04:17.970> and

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
combine the helium atoms together and

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.719 
combine the helium atoms together and
helium<00:04:19.530> atoms<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:19.889> hydrogen<00:04:20.280> atoms<00:04:20.549> and

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
helium atoms with hydrogen atoms and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.909 
helium atoms with hydrogen atoms and
those<00:04:21.419> molecules<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:22.199> added<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.740> and

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
those molecules get added on to and

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.879 
those molecules get added on to and
eventually<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.910> have<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.300> fairly<00:04:24.570> large

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
eventually you have some fairly large

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.480 
eventually you have some fairly large
molecules<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.039> contain<00:04:26.960> dozens<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.500> helium

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
molecules that contain dozens of helium

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
molecules that contain dozens of helium
and<00:04:29.610> hydrogen<00:04:29.880> atoms<00:04:30.120> all<00:04:30.389> combined<00:04:30.810> and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
and hydrogen atoms all combined and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.779 
and hydrogen atoms all combined and
those<00:04:31.740> atoms<00:04:32.130> are<00:04:32.370> atoms<00:04:32.970> like<00:04:33.210> carbon<00:04:33.479> and

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
those atoms are atoms like carbon and

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.890 
those atoms are atoms like carbon and
nitrogen<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:37.070> oxygen<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.630> atoms<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.720> make

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
nitrogen and oxygen the atoms that make

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.110 
nitrogen and oxygen the atoms that make
up<00:04:40.100> life<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:42.210> yes<00:04:42.449> every<00:04:42.870> atom<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.440> your<00:04:43.470> body

up life so yes every atom in your body

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.980 
up life so yes every atom in your body
was<00:04:45.120> once<00:04:45.360> part<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.810> star<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.990> some

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
was once part of a star and in some

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.930 
was once part of a star and in some
stars<00:04:49.289> that<00:04:49.590> are<00:04:49.740> big<00:04:49.949> enough<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.460> heavy

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
stars that are big enough and heavy

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.980 
stars that are big enough and heavy
enough<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.479> old<00:04:51.720> enough<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.550> massive<00:04:53.550> enough

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
enough and old enough and massive enough

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.570 
enough and old enough and massive enough
there's<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.320> much<00:04:55.470> pressure<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.070> density<00:04:56.220> in

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
there's so much pressure and density in

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.990 
there's so much pressure and density in
the<00:04:56.699> core<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.380> these<00:04:58.380> stars<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.520> neutrons

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
the core of these stars that neutrons

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.870 
the core of these stars that neutrons
themselves<00:05:00.539> are<00:05:00.660> free-floating<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.530> end<00:05:01.650> up

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
themselves are free-floating and end up

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.730 
themselves are free-floating and end up
attaching<00:05:02.880> themselves<00:05:03.389> onto<00:05:03.570> other<00:05:03.900> atoms

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
attaching themselves onto other atoms

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.480 
attaching themselves onto other atoms
and<00:05:04.950> this<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.160> how<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.370> can<00:05:05.639> build<00:05:05.820> very<00:05:06.169> large

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
and this is how we can build very large

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.640 
and this is how we can build very large
atoms<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:08.729> silver<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.330> gold<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:12.650> are

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
atoms like silver and gold so you are

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.930 
atoms like silver and gold so you are
looking<00:05:13.830> at<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:16.010> creator<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.160> silver<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.700> don't

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
looking at a creator of silver I don't

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.640 
looking at a creator of silver I don't
think<00:05:18.180> our<00:05:18.270> Sun<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:18.720> making<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.139> lot<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.289> silver

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
think our Sun is making a lot of silver

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.890 
think our Sun is making a lot of silver
at<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:19.889> point<00:05:20.190> but<00:05:20.400> maybe<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.270> long<00:05:21.510> time<00:05:21.720> down

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
at this point but maybe a long time down

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.620 
at this point but maybe a long time down
the<00:05:22.020> road<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.260> will<00:05:22.910> how<00:05:23.910> did<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> silver<00:05:24.479> get

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
the road it will how did the silver get

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.670 
the road it will how did the silver get
from<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:24.990> star<00:05:25.410> into<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:27.110> Canadian<00:05:28.110> maple

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
from that star into the Canadian maple

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.040 
from that star into the Canadian maple
that's<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.130> your<00:05:29.630> bullion<00:05:30.889> collection<00:05:33.050> well

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
that's in your bullion collection well

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.550 
that's in your bullion collection well
when<00:05:34.950> the<00:05:35.039> stars<00:05:35.510> dead<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:37.050> other<00:05:37.200> words<00:05:37.380> it's

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
when the stars dead in other words it's

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.260 
when the stars dead in other words it's
used<00:05:37.740> up<00:05:37.919> all<00:05:38.099> of<00:05:38.130> its<00:05:38.340> energy<00:05:38.490> and<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:38.910> reaches

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
used up all of its energy and it reaches

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.120 
used up all of its energy and it reaches
a<00:05:39.300> certain<00:05:39.570> point<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:42.510> will<00:05:42.810> well<00:05:43.650> there's<00:05:44.070> a

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
a certain point it will well there's a

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.110 
a certain point it will well there's a
lot<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.370> different<00:05:44.610> things<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.849> can<00:05:44.970> do

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
lot of different things that can do

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.930 
lot of different things that can do
depending<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:45.930> its<00:05:46.080> size<00:05:46.260> but<00:05:46.669> certain<00:05:47.669> stars

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
depending on its size but certain stars

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.550 
depending on its size but certain stars
explode<00:05:48.479> and<00:05:48.690> when<00:05:48.750> they<00:05:48.870> explode<00:05:49.229> they<00:05:49.260> send

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
explode and when they explode they send

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.850 
explode and when they explode they send
all<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.919> their<00:05:50.330> elements<00:05:51.440> back<00:05:52.440> out<00:05:52.680> into

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
all of their elements back out into

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.379 
all of their elements back out into
space<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:54.360> know<00:05:54.449> supernova<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:56.270> which<00:05:57.270> are

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
space you know supernova and which are

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.210 
space you know supernova and which are
incredibly<00:05:57.900> rare<00:05:58.139> events<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:58.919> there<00:05:59.099> are

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
incredibly rare events but there are

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.959 
incredibly rare events but there are
just<00:05:59.400> so<00:05:59.699> many<00:06:00.919> galaxies<00:06:01.919> out<00:06:02.130> there<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:02.610> so

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
just so many galaxies out there and so

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.839 
just so many galaxies out there and so
many<00:06:03.150> stars<00:06:03.450> in<00:06:03.599> each<00:06:03.690> galaxy<00:06:04.430> over<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.460> hundred

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
many stars in each galaxy over a hundred

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:06.959 
many stars in each galaxy over a hundred
billion<00:06:06.060> stars<00:06:06.240> and

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
billion stars and

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:08.850 
billion stars and
galaxy<00:06:07.509> alone<00:06:07.779> and<00:06:07.989> over<00:06:08.229> a<00:06:08.259> hundred<00:06:08.409> billion

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
galaxy alone and over a hundred billion

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.100 
galaxy alone and over a hundred billion
galaxies<00:06:09.339> out<00:06:09.489> there<00:06:09.729> there<00:06:10.659> are<00:06:10.689> so<00:06:10.929> many

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
galaxies out there there are so many

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.249 
galaxies out there there are so many
stars<00:06:11.379> and<00:06:11.829> the<00:06:12.579> universe<00:06:12.610> is<00:06:13.089> so<00:06:13.360> old<00:06:13.659> that

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
stars and the universe is so old that

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.759 
stars and the universe is so old that
there<00:06:14.679> have<00:06:14.799> been<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:15.009> lot<00:06:15.429> of<00:06:15.459> supernovae

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:16.769 
there have been a lot of supernovae

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:21.659 
there have been a lot of supernovae
supernovae<00:06:17.769> I<00:06:17.979> think<00:06:18.159> it<00:06:18.249> is<00:06:19.079> anyway<00:06:20.669> that's

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
supernovae I think it is anyway that's

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.469 
supernovae I think it is anyway that's
how<00:06:22.049> silver<00:06:23.049> gets<00:06:23.319> out<00:06:23.559> into<00:06:23.829> the<00:06:23.919> universe

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
how silver gets out into the universe

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.179 
how silver gets out into the universe
that's<00:06:25.479> how<00:06:25.689> it<00:06:25.809> was<00:06:25.899> created<00:06:26.139> there<00:06:26.799> was<00:06:26.919> none

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
that's how it was created there was none

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.359 
that's how it was created there was none
there<00:06:27.489> was<00:06:27.639> no<00:06:27.819> silver<00:06:28.499> originally<00:06:29.499> just

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:30.369 
there was no silver originally just

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:31.949 
there was no silver originally just
hydrogen<00:06:30.699> I<00:06:30.909> believe<00:06:31.179> hydrogen<00:06:31.749> and<00:06:31.869> helium

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:31.959 
hydrogen I believe hydrogen and helium

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.309 
hydrogen I believe hydrogen and helium
and<00:06:32.369> from<00:06:33.369> there<00:06:33.839> we<00:06:34.839> have<00:06:34.959> slowly

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
and from there we have slowly

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.899 
and from there we have slowly
accumulated<00:06:36.039> silver<00:06:36.489> throughout<00:06:36.759> the

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
accumulated silver throughout the

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:42.869 
accumulated silver throughout the
universe<00:06:37.799> over<00:06:38.849> 14<00:06:39.849> billion<00:06:40.119> years<00:06:40.619> so<00:06:41.759> if<00:06:42.759> you

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
universe over 14 billion years so if you

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.119 
universe over 14 billion years so if you
think<00:06:42.999> about<00:06:43.119> that<00:06:43.299> way<00:06:43.539> I<00:06:43.889> guess<00:06:44.889> you<00:06:45.009> could

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
think about that way I guess you could

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.499 
think about that way I guess you could
say<00:06:45.309> that<00:06:45.489> the<00:06:45.610> amount<00:06:45.789> of<00:06:46.029> silver<00:06:46.299> in<00:06:46.419> the

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:46.509 
say that the amount of silver in the

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.819 
say that the amount of silver in the
universe<00:06:46.809> is<00:06:47.189> increasing<00:06:48.239> over<00:06:49.239> time<00:06:49.829> but

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:50.829 
universe is increasing over time but

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:52.979 
universe is increasing over time but
here<00:06:51.699> on<00:06:51.849> earth<00:06:51.879> we<00:06:52.269> do<00:06:52.389> have<00:06:52.569> a<00:06:52.599> limited

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:52.989 
here on earth we do have a limited

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:58.159 
here on earth we do have a limited
supply<00:06:53.199> and<00:06:54.389> we<00:06:55.389> are<00:06:55.569> using<00:06:55.899> it<00:06:56.169> up<00:06:56.319> and

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
supply and we are using it up and

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.029 
supply and we are using it up and
running<00:06:59.169> a<00:06:59.319> bit<00:06:59.469> low<00:07:01.289> price<00:07:02.289> isn't<00:07:02.529> reflecting

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
running a bit low price isn't reflecting

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.919 
running a bit low price isn't reflecting
that<00:07:03.129> right<00:07:03.339> now<00:07:03.489> we're<00:07:03.729> down<00:07:03.849> to<00:07:03.909> $15<00:07:04.779> an

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:04.929

silver<00:07:08.649> we're<00:07:08.799> not<00:07:08.889> talking<00:07:09.189> about<00:07:09.219> the

I<00:07:17.800> hope<00:07:17.979> that<00:07:18.159> was<00:07:18.309> at<00:07:18.849> least<00:07:18.909> moderately

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
I hope that was at least moderately

I hope that was at least moderately
interesting<00:07:19.929> and<00:07:20.610> I<00:07:21.610> realized<00:07:22.479> it's<00:07:22.629> a<00:07:22.719> bit

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:25.439 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.139 

simplified<00:07:26.439> and<00:07:27.069> I<00:07:27.519> probably<00:07:27.819> got<00:07:28.029> a<00:07:28.089> few

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:28.149 
simplified and I probably got a few

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:29.639 
simplified and I probably got a few
things<00:07:28.419> slightly<00:07:28.809> wrong<00:07:28.959> as<00:07:29.169> well<00:07:29.289> it's<00:07:29.499> been

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:29.649 
things slightly wrong as well it's been

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.199 
things slightly wrong as well it's been
a<00:07:29.800> while<00:07:30.069> since<00:07:30.309> I<00:07:30.519> was<00:07:30.550> in<00:07:30.669> physics<00:07:31.089> and

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:31.209 
a while since I was in physics and

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:35.639 
a while since I was in physics and
chemistry<00:07:31.269> but<00:07:32.039> that<00:07:33.039> was<00:07:33.189> the<00:07:33.279> basics<00:07:34.649> we're

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:35.649 
chemistry but that was the basics we're

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:38.999 
chemistry but that was the basics we're
having<00:07:35.829> a<00:07:35.860> good<00:07:35.979> day<00:07:36.189> keep<00:07:36.610> on<00:07:36.759> stacking
