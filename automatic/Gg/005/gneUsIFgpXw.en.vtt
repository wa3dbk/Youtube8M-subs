00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 was printed from the violet notebook and goes 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.410
 tell me here 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 arriving here can not appear 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.759
 no paper Purple paper and even home 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 Hair only smoking here and here 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.980
 There you go, it does not pass. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.550
 to pass glue among people because this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.550
 It will not mark that it's more expensive, you see. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.399
 There you go, I'll understand you. 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.590
 if there is a little leftover there is no problem 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 but as little as possible to appear 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 better say, but heard how 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 stayed there you'll get softex in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 size them and who will not need 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.229
 talk about cutting little I'm going to cut 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 because if I needed to do 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 but if you do not want to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 cut is just serving here puts people more 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.020
 in case we will cut people will 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 cut 1 just a piece because if people 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.930
 need in the average omid people there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.659
 People always leave a little here to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.970
 because from the other side to the one you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.700
 put here or stay here 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 always understood or leave a little bit to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.380
 more of the notebook to be collar brings a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.110
 here a little bit, too. 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.110
 A little bit can cut here. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 I know there are very few people, right? 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.600
 It's always good to enjoy it a lot 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.780
 It's hard to cut it right there, leaving a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.260
 little here and he bought a little to 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.790
 who's watching you will turn from any 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.890
 side, people 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.040
 teaching that has a bright side to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.050
 This side here that pass glue it has 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.810
 a smoother side 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.810
 There you have to pass glue from the other one there. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.810
 going from beginning to end 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:52.680
 Calm down , it's good because of that, people. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.820

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.440
 careful not to do anything wrong're 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:14.490

 Look how beautiful it is but it's more. 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:51.200
 that the side this side more smooth and that is 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:53.240
