00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.740 
would be the kind of situation where i
would<00:07:34.659> try<00:07:35.659> to<00:07:35.689> get<00:07:35.899> my<00:07:36.019> shiny<00:07:36.229> on<00:07:36.439> that

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
would try to get my shiny on that

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.430 
would try to get my shiny on that
in<00:07:37.110> box<00:07:37.530> or<00:07:37.860> circumstance<00:07:38.490> or<00:07:38.930> I<00:07:39.930> might<00:07:40.200> try

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
in box or circumstance or I might try

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.470 
in box or circumstance or I might try
fishing<00:07:40.800> not<00:07:41.730> fish<00:07:41.940> chaining<00:07:42.480> and<00:07:44.480> or
