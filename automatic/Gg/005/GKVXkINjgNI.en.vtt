 - had already leaked repertoire promises 81 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.290
 I felt very thin 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 I was 69 kilos 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150

 since 2005 actually I have been preparing 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.950
 most seriously was when I decided that I really wanted to

 give a good futuristic movie 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 and I saw that I had the potential for this 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 I started to invest from these animals in my career as a fixed 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 in 2006 I did a good job competing in the miss universe yet by the entity 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.190
 right after the end 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.360
 cdb in 2007 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 was Brazilian champion in 2007 world competition 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.900

 a certain ease 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.140
 it's a very satisfying feeling nervous word right 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.099
 the whole event was 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 well structured 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.349

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 from fbb 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.909

 in terms of the event 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.649
 my greatest idol in the sport 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.649
 in fact there are two medical dvds 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.209
 the first authors 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.209
