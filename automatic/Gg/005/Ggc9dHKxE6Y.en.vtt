released<00:01:04.989> anomaly<00:01:05.440> site<00:01:05.710> yeah<00:01:05.950> but<00:01:06.820> we<00:01:06.940> can<00:01:07.060> do

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
released anomaly site yeah but we can do

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.389 
released anomaly site yeah but we can do
some<00:01:07.360> deductive<00:01:07.780> reasoning<00:01:07.900> over<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.159> past

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
some deductive reasoning over the past

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.940 
some deductive reasoning over the past
of<00:01:09.579> Halo<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.540> know<00:01:10.659> every<00:01:10.960> event<00:01:11.170> MLG<00:01:11.680> has<00:01:11.799> had

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
of Halo you know every event MLG has had

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.830 
of Halo you know every event MLG has had
so<00:01:12.100> far<00:01:12.310> has<00:01:12.520> pretty<00:01:12.850> much<00:01:12.909> been<00:01:13.149> you<00:01:13.420> know<00:01:13.509> no

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
so far has pretty much been you know no

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.749 
so far has pretty much been you know no
vehicles<00:01:14.320> no<00:01:14.380> radar<00:01:14.740> which<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.579> going<00:01:15.670> to

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
vehicles no radar which is going to

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.490 
vehicles no radar which is going to
eliminate<00:01:16.090> some<00:01:16.119> motor<00:01:16.420> options<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.259> with<00:01:17.380> no

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
eliminate some motor options so with no

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.050 
eliminate some motor options so with no
radar<00:01:17.829> you're<00:01:18.460> not<00:01:18.579> going<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.820> worry<00:01:18.970> about

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
radar you're not going to worry about

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.090 
radar you're not going to worry about
sensor<00:01:19.750> awareness<00:01:20.259> which<00:01:20.500> deals<00:01:21.009> with

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
sensor awareness which deals with

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.700 
sensor awareness which deals with
increased<00:01:21.520> range<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.090> radar<00:01:22.390> or<00:01:22.960> being

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
increased range of the radar or being

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.440 
increased range of the radar or being
zoomed<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.250> seen<00:01:24.399> radar<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.880> same<00:01:25.270> with

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
zoomed in and seen radar and same with

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.090 
zoomed in and seen radar and same with
like<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.719> vehicle<00:01:26.079> options<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.860> you'll

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
like the vehicle options that you'll

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.440 
like the vehicle options that you'll
have<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.340> worry<00:01:27.430> about<00:01:27.520> like<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.729> gunner<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
have to worry about like the gunner the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
have to worry about like the gunner the
wheel<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.780> loadouts

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
wheel and loadouts

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.830 
wheel and loadouts
so<00:01:30.490> these<00:01:30.640> are<00:01:30.790> all<00:01:30.939> assumptions<00:01:31.450> first<00:01:31.570> off

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
so these are all assumptions first off

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.929 
so these are all assumptions first off
so<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.350> there<00:01:32.590> happens<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.189> be<00:01:33.280> radar<00:01:33.700> there

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
so if there happens to be radar there

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.270 
so if there happens to be radar there
happens<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.329> view<00:01:34.539> vehicles<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:36.130> gonna

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
happens to view vehicles you're gonna

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.010 
happens to view vehicles you're gonna
have<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.520> face<00:01:37.000> your<00:01:37.180> doubts<00:01:37.479> depending<00:01:37.899> on

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
have to face your doubts depending on

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.819 
have to face your doubts depending on
that<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.460> first<00:01:40.030> off<00:01:40.270> if<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:41.170> was<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.560> compete

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
that but first off if I was to compete

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.499 
that but first off if I was to compete
in<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.039> event<00:01:42.100> here's<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.969> lord<00:01:43.119> out<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.479> I

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
in the event here's the lord out that I

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.610 
in the event here's the lord out that I
would<00:01:43.840> go<00:01:44.020> with

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.720 

so<00:01:52.620> as<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.830> can<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.160> in<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.370> warm-up

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
so as you can see in this warm-up

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.090 
so as you can see in this warm-up
loadout<00:01:54.120> I've<00:01:54.900> suggested<00:01:55.110> starting<00:01:55.620> off<00:01:55.890> with

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
loadout I've suggested starting off with

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
loadout I've suggested starting off with
the<00:01:56.220> DMR<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.270> battle<00:01:57.570> rifle<00:01:57.690> now<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the DMR and the battle rifle now it's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.140 
the DMR and the battle rifle now it's
possible<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.100> start<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.400> with<00:01:59.520> two<00:01:59.700> primary

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
possible to start off with two primary

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.970 
possible to start off with two primary
weapons<00:02:00.480> because<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.050> tactical<00:02:01.500> package<00:02:01.830> has

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
weapons because the tactical package has

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.140 
weapons because the tactical package has
suggested<00:02:02.400> firepower

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
suggested firepower

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.560 
suggested firepower
now<00:02:03.690> I'm<00:02:03.810> only<00:02:04.020> suggesting<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.190> warm-up

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
now I'm only suggesting this for warm-up

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.820 
now I'm only suggesting this for warm-up
for<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.690> reasons<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.470> switch

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
for the reasons that you can switch

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.320 
for the reasons that you can switch
between<00:02:08.040> these<00:02:08.220> two<00:02:08.280> weapons<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.880> find<00:02:09.179> out

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
between these two weapons and find out

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
between these two weapons and find out
which<00:02:09.630> ones<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.960> prefer<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.560> why<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> prefer

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
which ones you prefer and why you prefer

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.600 
which ones you prefer and why you prefer
them<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.540> personally<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.260> found<00:02:14.040> them<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.370> both

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
them so personally I found them to both

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.660 
them so personally I found them to both
be<00:02:14.850> great<00:02:15.210> all-around<00:02:15.480> weapons<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.070> prefer

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
be great all-around weapons but I prefer

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.540 
be great all-around weapons but I prefer
battle<00:02:18.450> from<00:02:18.720> close<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.320> mid<00:02:19.470> range<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.860> DMR

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
battle from close to mid range and DMR

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.949 
battle from close to mid range and DMR
from<00:02:20.700> long<00:02:20.850> range<00:02:20.880> from<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> limited<00:02:21.750> times

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
from long range from the limited times

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.420 
from long range from the limited times
I've<00:02:22.140> had<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> chance<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> play<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.980> game<00:02:23.160> I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
I've had a chance to play this game I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.910 
I've had a chance to play this game I
have<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.480> stress<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:25.020> important<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
have to stress how important it is to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
have to stress how important it is to
find<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.580> primary<00:02:26.970> weapon<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.330> want<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.540> use

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
find what primary weapon you want to use

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.979 
find what primary weapon you want to use
and<00:02:27.990> learn<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.160> fast<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.640> possible<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.330> feel

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
and learn it as fast as possible I feel

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.060 
and learn it as fast as possible I feel
it<00:02:31.080> seems<00:02:31.260> they're<00:02:31.410> gonna<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> best<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
it seems they're gonna do the best of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.830 
it seems they're gonna do the best of
this<00:02:32.220> event<00:02:32.489> are<00:02:32.850> not<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.630> ones

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this event are not only just the ones

this event are not only just the ones
that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.989> work<00:02:34.290> together<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.800> most<00:02:34.950> but

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that I work together at the most but

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.370 
that I work together at the most but
they're<00:02:36.180> gonna<00:02:36.270> be<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> ones<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.750> master

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
they're gonna be the ones that master

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.900 
they're gonna be the ones that master
the<00:02:37.530> most<00:02:37.680> important<00:02:38.160> aspects<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> game

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the most important aspects of the game

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.330 
the most important aspects of the game
the<00:02:39.120> fastest<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> obviously<00:02:40.650> primary<00:02:41.070> weapon

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the fastest and obviously primary weapon

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.979 
the fastest and obviously primary weapon
is<00:02:41.550> one<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> most<00:02:41.970> important<00:02:42.510> aspects<00:02:42.930> of

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
is one of the most important aspects of

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.860 
is one of the most important aspects of
the<00:02:43.110> game<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.880> next<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.209> in<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.420> loadout<00:02:45.690> we

the game so next up in this loadout we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.170 
the game so next up in this loadout we
have<00:02:46.020> grenade<00:02:46.820> even<00:02:47.820> though<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> didn't

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
have grenade even though I didn't

how to instance load them in my last

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
video I feel like it's an unusable

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.759 
video I feel like it's an unusable
tactic<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.570> early<00:02:54.989> into<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> tournament

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
tactic this early into the tournament

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.160 
tactic this early into the tournament
scene<00:02:56.130> seeing<00:02:56.940> how<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.120> only<00:02:57.299> have<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.510> day<00:02:57.750> or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
scene seeing how you only have a day or

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.840 
scene seeing how you only have a day or
so<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.410> prepare<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.130> learn<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.489> game<00:02:59.519> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so to prepare and learn the game I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.479 
so to prepare and learn the game I
really<00:03:00.690> don't<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.350> viable<00:03:01.590> tactic

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
really don't think it's a viable tactic

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.240 
really don't think it's a viable tactic
so<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:04.110> brings<00:03:04.350> me<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.680> choosing<00:03:05.040> frag

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
so this brings me to choosing frag

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.039 
so this brings me to choosing frag
grenades<00:03:05.549> frag<00:03:06.209> grenades<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.690> super

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
grenades frag grenades are super

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.930 
grenades frag grenades are super
versatile<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:08.400> I'd<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.640> doing<00:03:08.670> during

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
versatile and what I'd be doing during

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940 
versatile and what I'd be doing during
this<00:03:09.120> warm-ups<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.750> definitely<00:03:10.530> testing<00:03:10.860> them

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
this warm-ups is definitely testing them

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.890 
this warm-ups is definitely testing them
up<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.190> ramps<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.880> how<00:03:12.180> far<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.540> balance

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
up on ramps see how far they balance

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.560 
up on ramps see how far they balance
where<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.320> explode<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.090> test<00:03:15.090> them<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.390> on

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
where they explode I test them out on

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.240 
where they explode I test them out on
solid<00:03:15.959> ground<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.380> seeing<00:03:16.620> how<00:03:16.920> far<00:03:17.130> they

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
solid ground just seeing how far they

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.710 
solid ground just seeing how far they
actually<00:03:17.489> skip<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.970> how<00:03:18.060> long<00:03:18.209> they<00:03:18.360> take<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
actually skip and how long they take the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.380 
actually skip and how long they take the
set<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.170> explode<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.910> I'll<00:03:20.910> definitely

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
set and explode and I'll definitely

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.180 
set and explode and I'll definitely
choose<00:03:21.510> frag<00:03:21.840> grenades<00:03:22.140> over<00:03:22.290> pulse<00:03:22.830> grenades

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
choose frag grenades over pulse grenades

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.949 
choose frag grenades over pulse grenades
because<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.700> see<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.180> being<00:03:24.209> more<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.870> an

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
because I see them as being more of an

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.810 
because I see them as being more of an
offensive<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.709> defensive<00:03:26.519> grenade

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
offensive and defensive grenade

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.340 
offensive and defensive grenade
whereas<00:03:27.390> pulse<00:03:27.630> grenades<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.170> could

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
whereas pulse grenades you could

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.870 
whereas pulse grenades you could
definitely<00:03:28.530> throw<00:03:28.769> those<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.250> doorway<00:03:29.640> and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
definitely throw those in a doorway and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.580 
definitely throw those in a doorway and
fire<00:03:30.150> yourself<00:03:30.450> more<00:03:30.630> time<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.200> use<00:03:31.470> them

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
fire yourself more time and use them

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.590 
fire yourself more time and use them
defensively<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.970> don't<00:03:33.150> see<00:03:33.299> them<00:03:33.420> being

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
defensively I just don't see them being

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.250 
defensively I just don't see them being
as<00:03:33.810> strong<00:03:34.049> offensively<00:03:35.510> as<00:03:36.510> far<00:03:36.840> as<00:03:36.930> armor

as strong offensively as far as armor

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
you can see your opponent's where they

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.229 
you can see your opponent's where they

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
are where they're coming from and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.780 
are where they're coming from and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.850 
especially then no radar situation it's

gonna give you the upper hand and I

really don't see any of the other armor

keynesian vision at last we have the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.580 
keynesian vision at last we have the
support<00:03:57.120> upgrade<00:03:57.480> which<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.230> chosen<00:03:58.260> that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
support upgrade which I have chosen that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.650 
support upgrade which I have chosen that
stability<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.640> those<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.120> unfamiliar

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
stability for those of you unfamiliar

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.140 
stability for those of you unfamiliar
with<00:04:00.780> Halo<00:04:01.050> 4<00:04:01.319> in<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:02.520> game<00:04:02.760> when<00:04:03.000> you're

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
with Halo 4 in this game when you're

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.809 
with Halo 4 in this game when you're
shot

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
shot

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.610 
shot
any<00:04:04.939> weapon<00:04:05.329> your<00:04:06.019> you're<00:04:06.319> gonna<00:04:06.409> have<00:04:06.590> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
any weapon your you're gonna have a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.110 
any weapon your you're gonna have a
slight<00:04:06.950> amount<00:04:07.219> of<00:04:07.280> recoil<00:04:07.459> where<00:04:07.999> your

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
slight amount of recoil where your

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.059 
slight amount of recoil where your
cursor<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.420> gonna<00:04:08.599> move<00:04:08.780> around<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.109> this

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
cursor is gonna move around and this

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.059 
cursor is gonna move around and this
decreases<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:12.019> feel<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:12.829> gonna<00:04:12.920> be

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
decreases that so I feel it's gonna be

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.739 
decreases that so I feel it's gonna be
one<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.400> strongest<00:04:13.819> support<00:04:14.239> upgrades

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:14.749 
one of the strongest support upgrades

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.719 
one of the strongest support upgrades
out<00:04:14.930> there<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.409> on<00:04:15.799> top<00:04:16.009> of<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.519> gonna

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
out there and on top of that it's gonna

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.999 
out there and on top of that it's gonna
be<00:04:16.880> even<00:04:17.690> stronger<00:04:17.959> for<00:04:18.259> long<00:04:18.500> range<00:04:18.680> fights

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
be even stronger for long range fights

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.310 
be even stronger for long range fights
this<00:04:19.280> goes<00:04:19.489> very<00:04:19.880> well<00:04:20.090> coupled<00:04:20.539> with<00:04:20.570> DMR<00:04:21.079> on

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
this goes very well coupled with DMR on

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.760 
this goes very well coupled with DMR on
larger<00:04:21.859> mass<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.080> covers<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.470> warm-up

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
larger mass so that covers the warm-up

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.529 
larger mass so that covers the warm-up
loadout<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.220> how<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> would<00:04:25.729> personally<00:04:26.120> train

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
loadout and how I would personally train

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.029 
loadout and how I would personally train
it<00:04:26.630> for<00:04:26.720> this<00:04:26.810> event<00:04:27.020> if<00:04:27.259> I<00:04:27.380> was<00:04:27.500> competing<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
it for this event if I was competing it

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.700 
it for this event if I was competing it
so<00:04:28.789> now<00:04:28.970> let<00:04:29.599> me<00:04:29.630> go<00:04:29.870> over<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.110> couple<00:04:30.349> specific

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
so now let me go over a couple specific

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
so now let me go over a couple specific
load<00:04:31.310> outs<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:31.729> what<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.090> actually<00:04:32.360> use<00:04:32.599> in

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
load outs on what I actually use in

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.589 
load outs on what I actually use in
tournament<00:04:33.320> play<00:04:33.349> at<00:04:33.710> seven<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:35.360> first

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
tournament play at seven this first

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.450 
tournament play at seven this first
loadout<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.110> targeted<00:04:36.530> at<00:04:36.590> larger<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:37.280> more

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
loadout is targeted at larger and more

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.010 
loadout is targeted at larger and more
open<00:04:37.729> maths<00:04:37.970> ones<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:38.900> see

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
open maths ones that you can see

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.659 
open maths ones that you can see
yourself<00:04:39.110> getting<00:04:39.500> into<00:04:39.650> more<00:04:39.949> made<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.490> long

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
range fights in and obviously I chose

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.189 
range fights in and obviously I chose
DMR<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> couple<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.539> stability<00:04:44.720> for<00:04:45.139> the

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
DMR a couple of stability for the

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.450 
DMR a couple of stability for the
reasons<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.590> explained<00:04:45.919> earlier<00:04:46.099> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
reasons that I explained earlier the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.580 
reasons that I explained earlier the
only<00:04:47.419> big<00:04:47.660> difference<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.110> on<00:04:48.349> here<00:04:48.530> is

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
only big difference you see on here is

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.409 
only big difference you see on here is
the<00:04:48.770> tactical<00:04:49.220> package<00:04:49.580> where<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.030> have<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
the tactical package where I have a a

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.570 
the tactical package where I have a a
efficiency<00:04:51.229> which<00:04:51.740> for<00:04:51.979> those<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.400> don't

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
efficiency which for those of you don't

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.730 
efficiency which for those of you don't
know<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:53.479> actually<00:04:53.900> has<00:04:54.080> your<00:04:54.289> armored

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
know that actually has your armored

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.010 
know that actually has your armored
ability<00:04:55.160> recharge<00:04:55.940> faster<00:04:56.150> so<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.750> put

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
ability recharge faster so you can put

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.680 
ability recharge faster so you can put

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
Promethean vision out born for this next

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.240 
Promethean vision out born for this next
loadout<00:05:00.020> which<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:00.320> recommend<00:05:00.470> for<00:05:00.889> smaller

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
loadout which I recommend for smaller

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.249 
loadout which I recommend for smaller
Maps<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.300> see<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.630> start<00:05:02.960> out<00:05:02.990> with<00:05:03.050> the

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
Maps you can see I start out with the

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.560 
Maps you can see I start out with the
battle<00:05:03.650> rifle<00:05:03.949> for<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.099> primary<00:05:04.550> weapon<00:05:04.880> for

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
battle rifle for the primary weapon for

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.969 
battle rifle for the primary weapon for
the<00:05:05.630> reasons<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:05.990> explained<00:05:06.259> earlier<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.949> just

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
the reasons I explained earlier it just

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.010 
the reasons I explained earlier it just
seems<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:07.759> much<00:05:07.940> easier<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.449> have<00:05:08.599> mid<00:05:08.900> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
seems so much easier to have mid the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.110 
seems so much easier to have mid the
close<00:05:09.229> range<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:10.039> can<00:05:10.159> kill<00:05:10.400> in<00:05:10.550> four<00:05:10.849> shots

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
close range you can kill in four shots

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.020 
close range you can kill in four shots
as<00:05:11.330> long<00:05:11.479> as<00:05:11.599> you<00:05:11.659> hit<00:05:11.750> every<00:05:12.080> bullet<00:05:12.320> and<00:05:12.590> just

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
as long as you hit every bullet and just

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.879 
as long as you hit every bullet and just
very<00:05:14.030> strong<00:05:14.300> weapon<00:05:14.570> all<00:05:14.659> around<00:05:14.900> one<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.830> the

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
very strong weapon all around one of the

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.439 
very strong weapon all around one of the
bigger<00:05:16.039> differences<00:05:16.550> you'll<00:05:16.729> see<00:05:16.940> is<00:05:17.150> how<00:05:17.419> I

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
bigger differences you'll see is how I

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.140 
bigger differences you'll see is how I
have<00:05:17.840> stealth<00:05:18.289> as<00:05:18.500> a<00:05:18.530> support<00:05:18.949> upgrade<00:05:19.220> now

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
have stealth as a support upgrade now

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.520 
have stealth as a support upgrade now
what<00:05:20.360> stealth<00:05:20.630> has<00:05:20.810> for<00:05:21.110> those<00:05:21.199> of<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.380> don't

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
what stealth has for those of you don't

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.040 
what stealth has for those of you don't
know<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.949> it<00:05:22.610> dampens<00:05:22.970> your<00:05:23.120> footsteps<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.840> on

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
know is it dampens your footsteps and on

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.439 
know is it dampens your footsteps and on
top<00:05:24.259> of<00:05:24.409> that<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.830> makes<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.580> bit<00:05:26.030> harder<00:05:26.389> to

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
top of that it makes it a bit harder to

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.659 
top of that it makes it a bit harder to
detect<00:05:26.720> from<00:05:26.930> Promethean<00:05:27.470> vision<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.919> expect

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
detect from Promethean vision I expect

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.339 
detect from Promethean vision I expect
many<00:05:28.880> people<00:05:29.030> will<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.360> using<00:05:29.690> this<00:05:29.810> event<00:05:30.080> so

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
many people will be using this event so

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.200 
many people will be using this event so
stalls<00:05:30.680> can<00:05:30.889> be<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.009> very<00:05:31.460> strong<00:05:31.789> support

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
stalls can be a very strong support

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.240 
stalls can be a very strong support
upgrade<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:33.259> other<00:05:33.409> new<00:05:33.620> option<00:05:33.949> you<00:05:34.039> see<00:05:34.220> I

there first off I had not account for
personal<00:06:13.130> ordnance<00:06:13.669> drops<00:06:13.880> so<00:06:14.150> if<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.419> was

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
personal ordnance drops so if that was

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.100 
personal ordnance drops so if that was
the<00:06:14.599> case

the case

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.990

requisition and orders priority would be

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.250 
requisition and orders priority would be
viable<00:06:17.330> options

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
viable options

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.710 
viable options
