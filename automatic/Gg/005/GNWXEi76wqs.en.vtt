is<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.060> input<00:01:18.060> AC<00:01:19.040> 120<00:01:20.040> volt<00:01:20.250> output<00:01:20.490> DC<00:01:21.150> 10<00:01:21.750> volt

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
is a input AC 120 volt output DC 10 volt

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.550 
is a input AC 120 volt output DC 10 volt
power<00:01:23.850> supply<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
power supply I think this was for like

an iPod dock that broke the speaker's
blew<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.850> increases<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.840> fan<00:01:31.790> here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
blew out but this increases the fan here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
blew out but this increases the fan here
I'll<00:01:33.060> take<00:01:33.329> by<00:01:33.780> I'd<00:01:34.259> say<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:34.710> half<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I'll take by I'd say about half it it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'll take by I'd say about half it it
does<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> job<00:01:38.270> alright<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.540> let's<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> to

Glue halfway a screen pouring some

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.830 
Glue halfway a screen pouring some
carbon<00:05:11.680> filter<00:05:12.130> until<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.180> fills<00:05:13.419> up<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.750> the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
oh yeah like I was saying my box is kind

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.800 
oh yeah like I was saying my box is kind
of<00:05:54.139> messed<00:05:54.350> up<00:05:54.530> because<00:05:54.980> I<00:05:55.160> had<00:05:55.370> to<00:05:55.630> glue<00:05:56.630> these

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
of messed up because I had to glue these

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.330 
of messed up because I had to glue these
two<00:05:57.020> speakers<00:05:57.350> together<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:57.800> I<00:05:57.860> kind<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.130> put

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
two speakers together so I kind of put

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.940 
two speakers together so I kind of put
some<00:05:58.370> across<00:05:58.790> boards<00:05:59.260> which<00:06:00.260> kind<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.710> I'm

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
some across boards which kind of I'm

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.440 
some across boards which kind of I'm
kind<00:06:00.980> of<00:06:01.220> regretting<00:06:01.370> right<00:06:01.850> now<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:02.030> could

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
kind of regretting right now I could

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.760 
kind of regretting right now I could
take<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.810> apart<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.200> make<00:06:03.260> it<00:06:03.440> even<00:06:03.620> better

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
take it apart and make it even better

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.640 
take it apart and make it even better
but<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.490> just<00:06:05.120> don't<00:06:05.330> feel<00:06:05.510> like<00:06:05.690> taking<00:06:06.560> the

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
but I just don't feel like taking the

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.170 
but I just don't feel like taking the
time<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:06.979> do<00:06:07.130> that<00:06:08.650> but<00:06:09.650> uh<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:10.250> think<00:06:10.910> this

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
time to do that but uh I think this

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.800 
time to do that but uh I think this
really<00:06:11.479> solves<00:06:11.930> a<00:06:12.340> carbon<00:06:13.340> filter<00:06:13.660> crisis<00:06:14.660> I

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
really solves a carbon filter crisis I

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.430 
really solves a carbon filter crisis I
guess<00:06:15.020> for<00:06:15.410> PC<00:06:15.800> grow<00:06:16.220> boxes<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:17.050> other<00:06:18.050> small

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
guess for PC grow boxes and other small

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.630 
guess for PC grow boxes and other small
boxes<00:06:18.919> so<00:06:19.210> like<00:06:20.210> comment<00:06:20.600> subscribe
