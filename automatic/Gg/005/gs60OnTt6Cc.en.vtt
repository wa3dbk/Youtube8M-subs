00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 for this recipe we are going to need two 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.400
 lemons only the juice in salt and pepper 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 to taste 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.940
 three tablespoons of oil one and a half 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 cup of cooked and drained lentils 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 half cup of chopped parsley leaves 12 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 medium finely chopped mint leaves 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 purple onion finely chopped two 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.830
 cucumbers peeled and chopped and destined and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.809
 100 grams of crumbled feta cheese and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 now if we are going to start preparing 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 first let's start with the by the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 vinaigrette this columbus to mix 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 our ingredients we are going to put 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.110
 first the fist of the other lemon the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.500
 cubito of the stakes around here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.550
 lemon is very very good for the stomach 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.050
 It also helps a lot when they have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.590
 stomach problems so that they 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.810
 hurts the little leg helps a lot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 only so to regenerate the mucosa of the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.370
 stomach even if you do not believe it if this one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.660
 it has been but this help a lot we are going 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.260
 to put salt and pepper 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.920
 before mixing our oil because 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.170
 well it dissolves well 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.720
 the salsita because they already put when 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.530
 we incorporate the oil 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.260
 so they stay like the brutes here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.090
 the anticipated and all kinds 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.090
 to incorporate lime very well 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.840
 and now we are going to incorporate our 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.840
 successes 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.640
 so this must be incorporated into 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.340
 ilo so that it falls slowly and alone 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.250
 is already doing that as more expensive the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.710
 vinaigrette when there are arrows acidity 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.620
 de jalÃ³n stays as ' los como como como 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.140
 the lumps so oil then this 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.659
 helps add a little there that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.859
 coordinate a little beat in 8 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.859
 as if they were 8 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.260
 until the vinaigrette turns the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.209
 consistency that you say I 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.930
 I recommend that what they use of oil 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.090
 a healthy oil for the heart 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.310
 Well, to give it once taking off the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.599
 cholesterol and triglycerides and yes 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.129
 you have diabetes will serve you very much 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.150
 and it's more oil also helps 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.590
 eliminate uric acid 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.049
 this one that did a lot of you and I was all 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 Friday and I do not know why that is going to 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.510
 help remove muscle pain by 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.510
 brave afternoon 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.210
 good to this mine cracks I'm going to 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.890
 book here a little bit we are going to put 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.830
 here our little lenses 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.830
 I do not do not want to use I want to speculate 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.620
 that 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.180
 because they are very rich in salad in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.430
 all 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.430
 and they smell rich they smell like sweet cited 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.870
 perfect now let's put our 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.420
 minced parsley 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.830
 let's incorporate it to give them the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.350
 flavor 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.350
 we are also going to put lies 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.049
 and we will incorporate again 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.640
 and now let them put onion 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.930
 I recommend that you make a purple ball that 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.209
 is a little bit less strong than 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.159
 white onion I love the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.780
 onions blackberries apart from that the 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.390
 purple onion unlike the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.250
 white onion has beta carotene and the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.500
 of such carotenes apart from that they arrange 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.819
 the skin exhibited in the wrinkles of 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.840
 think that it tastes very rich 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.780
 it gives us antioxidants again and one 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.450
 when the itches it then this and now less 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.330
 we have to cry we are going to put the cucumber 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.959
 that this is now that you have to be rich 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.330
 is very fresh salad wants us 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.830
 eat wants to eat 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.940
 well that downward 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.130
 ah good good good incorporate the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.010
 cucumber and I think I stayed the goal a 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 little boy but look when I see that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.470
 it is also a protein source then 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.470
 this dish is really very good 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.900
 to start the day because I also know 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.310
 they can eat breakfast because not now 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.310
 let's incorporate our 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:49.099
 exactly that is to give you the 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:52.200
 flavor I want to put a little more 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:55.980
 of salt and pepper 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.620
 and to give him nothing else what he lacks 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.810
 taste that does not lack salt to the food and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.270
 salt represents only 5% of what 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.190
 we eat so do not worry 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.889
 by the reflection of the liquid already be 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.090
 quiet 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.490
 this our salad let's go to 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.110
 put it here to reserve it a little while in 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.879
 the reverse so that it takes flavor and while 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.009
 so much we are going the commercial cuts 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.009
 and we return the horses 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.460
 remember that lentils are rich in 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.590
 vegetable proteins also contribute 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.630
 basic iron and fiber for a diet 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.450
 balanced your intake contributes to 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.900
 decrease cholesterol by its very high 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.900
