00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.440
 good afternoon everyone, we have a video today 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.290
 removed in the learning process such 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.360
 Express video I want to show you 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 a little nuance that will help the master 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 when performing correction avoid such 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.970
 options as dropped for her air 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 pockets for artificial material 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 probably faced with the fact that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.330
 the presence of air fed start 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 cut with a cuticle file 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.230
 towards the free edge like this 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.970
 that's the way the air pocket 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 pull and pull over 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.200
 material to avoid such problems i 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.170
 I want now on a nail 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.680
 we have here by the way on artificial 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 material on the gel model came with a gel 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 lacquer top was coated pigmented with 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 the surface is basically no big deal 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 In this there is no we now sawed it and on top 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 you can jump perry cover so for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.270
 order to avoid loathing here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270
 such air pockets under 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.309
 artificial material 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.579
 the main point is the direction 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.859
 nail files are not from the cuticle as usual 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.909
 happens like this to the free edge a 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.259
 vice versa 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.219
 we remove the thickness from the free edge 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.149
 material and bring it to nothing in the zone 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:27.560
 cuticle and so we immediately here 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.020
 at this stage for example limited 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.119
 air approach to the rest of the material 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.799
 sawed out and nullify in the cuticle area 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.919
 Further, all sawn on standard 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.729
 we capture the side beam 

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:45.840
 finger cut out the side line by the way 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.139
 very good that a lot 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.689
 pigmented on the video will be seen works 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.359
 sawdust 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.859
 we process the second part a leg. 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.989
 and after we sawed this zone 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.079
 finger angle -45 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:07.700
 from yourself and sawing at an angle of 10 degrees on 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.420
 yourself and either a little thought movement 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.269
 movements of the work that is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 we see that we have but this area 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.640
 nail a little bit failed in the zone because 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.659
 that the file does not cling to it means to us 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:33.329
 you need to align here or if you 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:36.590
 a lot of material to remove the left 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.780
 right or vice versa right to left with 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.079
 so in this way we saw more awkwardly 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.879
 from left to right 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 we remove material due to the fact that we have 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:52.370
 finger down from us and a nail file on us 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.530
 we do not cling to that particular zone 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.640
 near the nail roller 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.450
 artificial material lay 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.549
 so we see unevenly before 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.439
 gel nail polish 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.019
 it is necessary to align the color 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.079
 especially if it is french rather 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.939
 all or the material was different at 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.409
 primary at correction and subsequently and 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.379
 after we have completed this fifth 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.650
 function look at the butt of the nail with us 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.609
 the end of the nail should be the same 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.939
 all perimeter 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.739
 from the right to the left I will finish 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.739
 I wish you all a good mood for now
