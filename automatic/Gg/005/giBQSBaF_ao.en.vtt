00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.319 

their<00:00:35.640> eyes<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:36.059> starting<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> turn<00:00:36.630> blue<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.709 

I<00:00:42.770> managed<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.660> get<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> few<00:00:46.579> fuzzies<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
I managed to get a few fuzzies and I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.420 
I managed to get a few fuzzies and I
threw<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.530> first<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
threw it in with the first three and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.779 
threw it in with the first three and
they<00:00:50.700> immediately<00:00:51.449> ate<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> ended<00:00:53.670> up

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
they immediately ate so I ended up

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.600 
they immediately ate so I ended up
picking<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.300> 10<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.780> fuzzies<00:00:55.230> today<00:00:55.610> usually

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
picking up 10 more fuzzies today usually

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.270 
picking up 10 more fuzzies today usually
they<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.210> eat<00:00:57.590> before<00:00:58.590> their<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:58.949> shed

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
they don't eat before their first shed

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150 
they don't eat before their first shed
but<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.789> babies<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.890> pretty<00:01:01.890> thin

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
but all these babies had pretty thin

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549 
but all these babies had pretty thin
bellies<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.690> absorbed<00:01:03.690> all<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.870> yolk<00:01:04.199> by<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bellies and absorbed all the yolk by the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
bellies and absorbed all the yolk by the
time<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:04.979> were<00:01:05.040> born<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.860> them

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
time they were born so I just put them

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.719 
time they were born so I just put them
in<00:01:08.180> single<00:01:09.180> bins<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:10.530> blue<00:01:10.740> paper<00:01:11.010> towel<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in single bins some blue paper towel I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.210 
in single bins some blue paper towel I
spray<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> keep<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> moisture

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
spray really off and keep the moisture

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.810 
spray really off and keep the moisture
up<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.100> help<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.640> through

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
up and that's gonna help them go through

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
up and that's gonna help them go through
the<00:01:17.939> shed<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.689> helps<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:20.729> them

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the shed and it also helps for them

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.499 
the shed and it also helps for them
dropping<00:01:21.390> their<00:01:21.600> umbilical<00:01:22.590> cord<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.549> think

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
dropping their umbilical cord I think

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.560 
dropping their umbilical cord I think
that<00:01:24.659> I'll<00:01:24.780> snagged<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.470> dry<00:01:25.830> newspaper<00:01:26.570> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that I'll snagged on dry newspaper to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.620 
that I'll snagged on dry newspaper to
moist<00:01:27.869> paper<00:01:28.020> towel<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.420> they're<00:01:30.420> all

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
moist paper towel so they're all

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
moist paper towel so they're all
separated<00:01:31.430> 18<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> them<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:34.159> I'm<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.220> gonna

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
separated 18 of them and I'm just gonna

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960 
separated 18 of them and I'm just gonna
try<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> throw<00:01:36.119> some<00:01:37.430> fuzzies<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> them

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
try to throw some fuzzies in with them

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:53.350 
try to throw some fuzzies in with them

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
all the tricks you can do this litter

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.649 
all the tricks you can do this litter
they're<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:55.040> immediately

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
they're all immediately

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.999 
they're all immediately
and<00:01:58.470> Foley<00:01:58.770> any<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.189> those<00:01:59.400> tricks<00:02:00.799> we'll<00:02:01.799> see

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and Foley any of those tricks we'll see

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.160 
and Foley any of those tricks we'll see
if<00:02:02.130> there's<00:02:02.549> any<00:02:02.790> hard<00:02:03.390> figures<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.990> will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
if there's any hard figures that will

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.529 
if there's any hard figures that will
show<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> guys<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.830> take<00:02:05.009> care<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.400> this

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.780 

fuzzies<00:02:09.739> I'm<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:10.979> big<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.430> these<00:02:11.640> guys

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
fuzzies I'm pretty big but these guys

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
fuzzies I'm pretty big but these guys
could<00:02:12.030> probably<00:02:12.150> even<00:02:12.480> handle<00:02:12.900> hoppers<00:02:13.319> right

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
could probably even handle hoppers right

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.010 
could probably even handle hoppers right
away<00:02:13.800> if<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.910> were<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.360> fact<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.840> they'd

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
away if we were to the fact that they'd

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.610 
away if we were to the fact that they'd
be<00:02:16.230> too<00:02:16.770> jumpy<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:21.290> nothing<00:02:22.290> get

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
be too jumpy so what I do is nothing get

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.650 
be too jumpy so what I do is nothing get
the<00:02:22.770> smell<00:02:23.600> show<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> fuzzy<00:02:25.020> there<00:02:26.450> close<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the smell show the fuzzy there close the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.900 
the smell show the fuzzy there close the
van<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.230> end<00:02:28.830> up<00:02:28.920> checking<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.550> an<00:02:29.640> hour<00:02:29.819> so

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
van and I end up checking in an hour so

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.390 
van and I end up checking in an hour so
if<00:02:32.910> they're<00:02:33.120> even<00:02:33.269> interested<00:02:33.569> or<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.400> but

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
if they're even interested or not but

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.870 
if they're even interested or not but
like<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.700> said<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:36.870> three<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> tried

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
like I said the first three I tried

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.610 
like I said the first three I tried
within<00:02:38.880> an<00:02:39.030> hour<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.959> fuzzies<00:02:40.350> were<00:02:40.530> gone

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.710 

basically<00:02:46.620> yet<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.100> gonna<00:02:47.280> try<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.519> feed<00:02:47.819> 10

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
basically yet I'm gonna try to feed 10

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.680 
basically yet I'm gonna try to feed 10
of<00:02:48.900> them<00:02:49.019> right<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.850> see<00:02:50.850> how<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.120> goes<00:02:51.330> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
of them right now see how it goes and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.390 
of them right now see how it goes and
then<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:51.989> there's<00:02:52.230> any<00:02:53.090> shoveled<00:02:54.090> feeders

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
then if there's any shoveled feeders

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.770 
then if there's any shoveled feeders
I'll<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.760> employ<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> few<00:02:57.450> different

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I'll have to employ a few different

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.350 
I'll have to employ a few different
techniques<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.410> him<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.269> first

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
techniques for him this is the first

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.540 
techniques for him this is the first
time<00:03:03.810> they've<00:03:04.019> ever<00:03:04.170> seen<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.500> rodent

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.820 

all<00:03:12.120> right<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.510> let<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.020> guys<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.470> how<00:03:13.680> that

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
all right so let you guys know how that

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.670 
all right so let you guys know how that
turns<00:03:14.100> out

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
turns out

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.700 
turns out
it's<00:03:16.680> been<00:03:16.830> about<00:03:17.040> ten<00:03:17.340> minutes<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.560> can

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
it's been about ten minutes and you can

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.790 
it's been about ten minutes and you can
order<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> see<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:21.020> couple<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.050> more<00:03:22.320> figuring

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
order to see a couple of more figuring

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.390 
order to see a couple of more figuring
it<00:03:22.920> out

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
it out

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.210 
it out
this<00:03:23.640> guy's<00:03:23.880> not<00:03:24.120> wrapping<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this guy's not wrapping it so it's a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.770 
this guy's not wrapping it so it's a
good<00:03:26.340> thing<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> fuzzies<00:03:27.060> don't<00:03:27.300> flake<00:03:27.510> back

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
good thing the fuzzies don't flake back

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.260 
good thing the fuzzies don't flake back
too<00:03:28.050> much<00:03:29.690> there<00:03:30.690> he<00:03:30.780> goes<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:32.060> then<00:03:33.060> there's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
too much there he goes and then there's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.630 
too much there he goes and then there's
also<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.900> guy<00:03:35.390> figured<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> out<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.460> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
also this guy figured it out one of the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.070 
also this guy figured it out one of the
normals<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.740> said<00:03:46.800> they're<00:03:47.310> all

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
normals so like I said they're all

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.670 
normals so like I said they're all
taking<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.200> food<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.860> really<00:03:50.130> quickly<00:03:50.430> as

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
taking the food really really quickly as

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.320 
taking the food really really quickly as
compared<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.800> last<00:03:53.010> year's<00:03:53.490> litter<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.180> was

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
compared to last year's litter it was

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.150 
compared to last year's litter it was
about<00:03:54.600> two<00:03:54.900> or<00:03:55.020> three<00:03:55.230> weeks<00:03:55.470> before<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.070> he

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
about two or three weeks before and he

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.010 
about two or three weeks before and he
started<00:03:56.520> eating<00:03:59.240> still<00:04:00.240> learning<00:04:00.720> though<00:04:00.840> how

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
started eating still learning though how

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.610 
started eating still learning though how
to<00:04:01.080> constrict<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.280> stuff<00:04:03.020> he's<00:04:04.020> only<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.410> week

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to constrict and stuff he's only a week

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.080 
to constrict and stuff he's only a week
old<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:06.260> pretty<00:04:07.260> pretty<00:04:07.500> good<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.850> guy

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
old so pretty pretty good this guy

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.120 
old so pretty pretty good this guy
figured<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.660> out<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.110> he's<00:04:10.290> already<00:04:10.680> starting

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
figured it out and he's already starting

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:20.289 
figured it out and he's already starting
to<00:04:11.220> swallow

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.119 

so<00:04:21.299> that's<00:04:21.599> two<00:04:21.870> out<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.079> ten<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.680> ten<00:04:22.889> minutes

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:23.129 
so that's two out of ten in ten minutes

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.780 
so that's two out of ten in ten minutes
I'll<00:04:23.610> check<00:04:24.060> again<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.599> bit
