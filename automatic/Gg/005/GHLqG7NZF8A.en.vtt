00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.000 
and now we get to play with some more
explosives<00:03:16.689> that's<00:03:17.049> always<00:03:17.409> fun

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
explosives that's always fun

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.039 
explosives that's always fun
we<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.430> done<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> mini<00:03:18.939> at<00:03:19.090> 15<00:03:19.569> enemy

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
we have done the mini at 15 enemy

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.710 
we have done the mini at 15 enemy
personnel<00:03:20.349> with<00:03:20.920> explosives<00:03:21.670> most<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.599> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
personnel with explosives most of the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.630 
personnel with explosives most of the
soldiers<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.439> take<00:03:23.680> control<00:03:24.010> over<00:03:24.280> have

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
soldiers that you take control over have

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.059 
soldiers that you take control over have
some<00:03:24.909> form<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.329> explosives<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.590> be<00:03:26.709> sure<00:03:26.739> to

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
some form of explosives so be sure to

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:35.940 
some form of explosives so be sure to
share<00:03:27.250> them<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.760> enemy<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.739> is

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
share them with the enemy this is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.589 
share them with the enemy this is
probably<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.400> hardest<00:03:36.549> challenge<00:03:37.239> in<00:03:37.420> this

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
probably the hardest challenge in this

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.780 
probably the hardest challenge in this
mission<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.230> need<00:03:38.500> an<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.860> mini<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.190> 15<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
mission you need an the mini at 15 the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.640 
mission you need an the mini at 15 the
enemy<00:03:40.150> personnel<00:03:40.450> while<00:03:41.109> they're<00:03:41.319> stunned

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
enemy personnel while they're stunned

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.250 
enemy personnel while they're stunned
the<00:03:42.489> reason<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:42.909> find<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.299> one<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:43.780> hard<00:03:44.079> is

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the reason I find this one so hard is

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.869 
the reason I find this one so hard is
because<00:03:44.290> it's<00:03:44.709> completely<00:03:45.010> random<00:03:45.489> which

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
because it's completely random which

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.780 
because it's completely random which
soldiers<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.720> stun<00:03:47.049> grenades<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.799> find<00:03:48.640> it's

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
soldiers get stun grenades I find it's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.670 
soldiers get stun grenades I find it's
best<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.269> just<00:03:49.329> get<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.780> soldier<00:03:50.170> killed<00:03:50.440> if

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
best to just get the soldier killed if

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.319 
best to just get the soldier killed if
they<00:03:50.829> don't<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.190> stomach<00:03:51.579> remains<00:03:51.819> because

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
they don't have stomach remains because

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.000 
they don't have stomach remains because
then<00:03:52.510> more<00:03:52.780> troops<00:03:53.109> we<00:03:53.379> are<00:03:53.530> dropped<00:03:53.829> into

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
then more troops we are dropped into

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.610 
then more troops we are dropped into
here<00:03:54.310> once<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.389> finally<00:03:55.780> get<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.019> soldier<00:03:56.500> that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
here once you finally get a soldier that

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.229 
here once you finally get a soldier that
has<00:03:56.799> stun<00:03:57.099> grenades<00:03:57.489> you're<00:03:57.730> gonna<00:03:57.879> need<00:03:58.090> to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
has stun grenades you're gonna need to

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.180 
has stun grenades you're gonna need to
use<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.569> very<00:03:58.599> wisely<00:03:59.170> as<00:03:59.799> they're<00:04:00.010> so

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
use them very wisely as they're so

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.160 
use them very wisely as they're so
little<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.609> them<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:01.090> find<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.599> to<00:04:01.720> pass<00:04:01.870> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
little of them I find it to pass the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.259 
little of them I find it to pass the
wait<00:04:02.379> for<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.739> helicopter<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.430> airdrop<00:04:03.760> some

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
wait for a helicopter to airdrop some

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.390 
wait for a helicopter to airdrop some
enemies<00:04:04.750> in<00:04:04.930> then<00:04:05.590> stun<00:04:05.950> them<00:04:06.099> all<00:04:06.220> together

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
enemies in then stun them all together

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.670 
enemies in then stun them all together
and<00:04:06.940> they<00:04:07.180> won't<00:04:07.359> know<00:04:07.420> what's<00:04:07.750> happened<00:04:13.680> time

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
and they won't know what's happened time

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.379 
and they won't know what's happened time
for<00:04:14.859> a<00:04:14.950> little<00:04:15.069> hit<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.430> running<00:04:15.730> we're<00:04:16.180> gonna

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
for a little hit and running we're gonna

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.289 
for a little hit and running we're gonna
need<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.750> run<00:04:16.930> over<00:04:17.260> 20<00:04:17.769> enemy<00:04:18.220> personnel<00:04:18.549> with

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
need to run over 20 enemy personnel with

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.320 
need to run over 20 enemy personnel with
the<00:04:19.479> ASD<00:04:20.519> once<00:04:21.519> one<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.760> these<00:04:21.970> little<00:04:22.210> things

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
the ASD once one of these little things

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.960 
the ASD once one of these little things
are<00:04:22.780> dropped<00:04:23.289> in<00:04:23.500> just<00:04:23.979> jump<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> off
