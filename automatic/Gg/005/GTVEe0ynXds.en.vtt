also something we call the blueberry
hill<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.239> what<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.390> sounds<00:02:13.630> it's

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
hill and it is just what it sounds it's

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.319 
hill and it is just what it sounds it's
a<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.620> hillside<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.519> filled<00:02:16.239> with

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
a the hillside here will be filled with

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.970 
a the hillside here will be filled with
blueberry<00:02:16.870> patches<00:02:17.140> which<00:02:17.500> will<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.829> of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
blueberry patches which will be of

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.280 
blueberry patches which will be of
varying<00:02:18.370> colors<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.540> think<00:02:19.690> really<00:02:19.959> will

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
varying colors and we think really will

one of the neat things about this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.370 
one of the neat things about this
project<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.819> how<00:02:27.970> we're<00:02:28.180> reusing<00:02:28.600> portions<00:02:29.260> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
project is how we're reusing portions of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.319 
project is how we're reusing portions of
our<00:02:29.530> history<00:02:29.739> we're<00:02:30.489> standing<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:30.940> front<00:02:31.180> of

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
our history we're standing in front of

our history we're standing in front of
some<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.690> stones<00:02:31.930> from<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.350> old<00:02:32.440> central

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
some of the stones from the old central

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.559 
some of the stones from the old central
viaduct<00:02:33.310> how<00:02:33.670> are<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> reuse<00:02:34.329> these

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
viaduct how are we going to reuse these

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.720 
viaduct how are we going to reuse these
these<00:02:35.319> stones<00:02:35.590> would<00:02:35.769> be<00:02:35.889> reused<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.370> several

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
these stones would be reused in several

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.340 
these stones would be reused in several
ways<00:02:36.850> they'll<00:02:37.209> be<00:02:37.239> reused<00:02:37.720> here<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.019> Tremont

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
ways they'll be reused here in Tremont

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.140 
ways they'll be reused here in Tremont
and<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.769> erected<00:02:39.100> as<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> piers<00:02:39.609> which<00:02:39.850> served

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and we erected as the piers which served

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.629 
and we erected as the piers which served
as<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.930> original<00:02:41.350> central<00:02:41.769> viaduct<00:02:42.280> Pierce

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
as the original central viaduct Pierce

as the original central viaduct Pierce
that<00:02:43.120> will<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> really<00:02:43.660> great<00:02:43.840> thing<00:02:44.049> to

by<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.829> way<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.040> think<00:02:51.130> they're<00:02:51.400> put<00:02:51.549> on<00:02:51.670> an

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
by the way I think they're put on an

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640 
by the way I think they're put on an
exact<00:02:52.120> site<00:02:52.450> line<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> original<00:02:53.410> bridge
