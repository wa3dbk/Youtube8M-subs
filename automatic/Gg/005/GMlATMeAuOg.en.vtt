00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 this video may contain screamer or 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.589
 loud sounds that can cause you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.500
 scares therefore if you are a person 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.139
 who suffers from heart problems or 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 you just scare easily 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.000
 I recommend lowering the volume to your pc 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.550
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.350
 well this time I bring you the second 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.810
 part of the top 7 horror games 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 scares and fear of low requirements already 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.560
 that many asked me for 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.440
 I will always gladly make the videos that I 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.440
 ask for this top comes more recharged more 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.629
 terrifying not only video games like 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.610
 always the download links of each 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.650
 game are in the description and if 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.300
 have any questions or recommendations 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.660
 leave it in the comments 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.050
 good with nothing more to say let's start 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.050
 the top 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.710
 position number 7 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 suicide mouse as the mouse title says 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 suicidal this game is based on the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.860
 crepe and pasta the game is that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.290
 you have to walk the streets looking for 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 something that apparently is a door all 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.799
 what you will see in the tour is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 depressing just like the music already what 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.789
 the game will begin to appear 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 best known crepe and pasta and more 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.530
 terrifying as it is a very short game 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 I can not show you the parts where 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.979
 the scares would come like that when they play 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 everything will be unexpected 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.360
 so if you are going to play this game 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.369
 play it with the lights off with 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.960
 nobody at home because it's an experience 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.960
 that can only be given once 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 position number 6 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.830
 Corrido the Spanish translation 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.200
 it would be the runner like suicide 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.180
 mouse is a very short game but you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.400
 will keep attentive to every corridor that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.070
 you go because you could take a big 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.900
 I scare the game it starts that you're in a 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
 hotel room and when you leave the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.710
 room nothing is as you remember well 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.230
 that you should go deeper into the hotel 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 to know what's happening is a game 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 highly recommended to spend some time 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.830
 suspense with a friend so the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.460
 game is not as good as those that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460
 we will see next 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.469
 position number 5 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.390
 and how jovial it means fear of the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 trees and forests 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.950
 this game starts when you are in a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.380
 plane and crashes in a forest like no 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.600
 You have nowhere to go, you start to go 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.480
 in the forest finding objects like 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.100
 a flashlight and a gps while more 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.020
 inside the forest you find yourself 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.450
 you start to realize that this forest 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.400
 a race is not normal in the habitat 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.110
 that will make life impossible for you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.209
 I recommend that when you listen to some 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.220
 noise do not turn around because I could take you 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.020
 a tremendous shock that you will never forget 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.020
 so come carefully 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.680
 put the number 4 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.840
 sgp containment bridge the game starts 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.460
 in which two people enter a room 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 where is some kind of 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.510
 mutant experiment the monster 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.840
 reacts badly and begins to destroy it 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.270
 all 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.430
 after that you will be alone against 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.890
 that monster and others that will appear 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.690
 throughout the game I do not know much about 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.390
 that follows after that but I've seen 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.760
 that the game lasts a good time in this 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.460
 game compared to others you can 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.830
 save game the game apart from 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.360
 contain disturbing parts contains 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.880
 a series of puzzles that you should 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.650
 solve throughout the game the best 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.930
 is that they added the ability to 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.960
 blink which will give more suspense 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.940
 good from this game will start in 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.730
 the first three positions those that 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.690
 rate as the best here starts 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.690
 the real terror 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.890
 position number 3 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.120
 of them in Spanish the eyes in this 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.160
 game you are an unfortunate thief 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.200
 who goes into a house to try but not 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.060
 you know what awaits you there in the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.820
 reality is that there is a spirit that does not 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.680
 will leave you alone the game consists of 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.560
 that you have to collect 20 bags of 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.750
 jewelry and then escape with the booty this 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 game is different from all the others already 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.620
 that if you get some eyes that are 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.750
 painted on the wall you will be able to observe 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.480
 through the eyes of the ghost like this 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.310
 you can avoid it more easily the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.380
 the first time I played it I really liked it 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.330
 that's why I thought about putting it in the first 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.490
 but then I realized that the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.310
 Noises of the game did not give so many scares 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.310
 even so it takes a very high position 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.720
 place number 2 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.700
 or not 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.490
 it's slow and this is a game that does not 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.949
 I could be missing in this top 1 when I 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.499
 listen he says ridiculous because he would give 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.539
 fear a game of teletubbies for now 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.150
 you get reasons why this game 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.129
 this game was won so high the game 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.870
 it is that you are the only teletubi who 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.059
 he is safe and there is a teletubi 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.159
 demoniac who persecutes you therefore 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:49.710
 you must end this threat by looking 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.599
 seven plates of porridge on the way you 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.460
 You can find trees falling 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.949
 small is crevers that may appear 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.960
 anytime dead teletubbies 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.629
 that could give you a good scare between 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.669
 others this game can also be 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.770
 played two you like the teletubi that 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.899
 still alive and your friend who is teletubi 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.550
 maleficent that chases you or just 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.710
 both can be live teletubbies 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.080
 while the teletubi pursues them 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.809
 demoniac the game has three levels 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.779
 of difficulty is of day of afternoon and of 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:20.849
 night this game is very good I liked it 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.620
 a lot but the terror that this caused me 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.770
 game does not compare to the one that will see 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.770
 continuation 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.910
 with numbers 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.969
 but 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.770
 stp 087 of this game is that 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.810
 You have to go down stairs 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.629
 reach the end are a total of 100 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.580
 floors at a glance the game does not seem 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.499
 terrifying but the atmosphere of this 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.199
 game is so scary that it scares you 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:52.120
 even if you play it without sound apart from 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.740
 that the environment is terrifying in the 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.900
 you will find things 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.419
 horrible as demonic faces 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.849
 terrifying specters and sounds that you 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.889
 will give the worst shock of your life the worst 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.020
 of everything is that this game you can not 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.539
 configure it to play it on screen 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.229
 minimized that is, the bigger 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.210
 be your monitor you will get worse scares 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.529
 simply this game is too much 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.490
 terrifying that's why you win the job 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:18.919
 number one 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.020
