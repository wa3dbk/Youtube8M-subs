the<00:00:59.320> closest<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.830> most<00:01:00.010> simple<00:01:00.280> thing<00:01:00.460> you

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
the closest the most simple thing you

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.700 
the closest the most simple thing you
have<00:01:00.670> is<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> heartbeat<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.600> gets<00:01:02.260> faster

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
have is a heartbeat that gets faster

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.430 
have is a heartbeat that gets faster
when<00:01:02.830> you<00:01:02.920> get<00:01:03.070> angry<00:01:03.629> job<00:01:04.629> sad<00:01:04.899> or<00:01:05.110> thin<00:01:05.259> yeah

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
when you get angry job sad or thin yeah

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.830 
when you get angry job sad or thin yeah
you<00:01:05.920> know<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:07.030> slows<00:01:07.330> down

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
you know it slows down

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.719 
you know it slows down
similarly<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.649> music<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.160> film<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.550> like

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
similarly the music of the film is like

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.040 
similarly the music of the film is like
that<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.030> what<00:01:10.149> I<00:01:10.210> really<00:01:10.420> like<00:01:10.600> about<00:01:10.660> the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
that and what I really like about the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.350 
that and what I really like about the
album's<00:01:11.470> music<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.190> they<00:01:12.640> really<00:01:12.970> go

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
album's music is that they really go

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.760 
album's music is that they really go
with<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.630> film<00:01:13.869> very<00:01:14.020> well<00:01:14.140> like<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.530> blend
