but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.540> reckon<00:01:33.810> gas<00:01:34.020> ten<00:01:34.290> has<00:01:34.439> had<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.770> for

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
but I reckon gas ten has had one for

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.789 
but I reckon gas ten has had one for
years<00:01:35.450> because<00:01:36.450> he<00:01:36.750> wears<00:01:36.960> glasses<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> when

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
years because he wears glasses and when

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
years because he wears glasses and when
he<00:01:37.890> races<00:01:38.280> he<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.700> wear<00:01:39.360> glasses<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
he races he doesn't wear glasses so I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
he races he doesn't wear glasses so I
would<00:01:40.740> suggest<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.220> gas<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
would suggest that gas that a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
would suggest that gas that a
prescription<00:01:42.150> spray<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> issues

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
with the windscreen could come at

with the windscreen could come at
Bathurst<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.890> bright<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.369> need<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> share
