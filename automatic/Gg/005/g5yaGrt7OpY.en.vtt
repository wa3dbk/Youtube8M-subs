some text and I'll again just put in

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.450 
some text and I'll again just put in
some<00:02:57.150> nonsense<00:02:57.840> text<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> idea

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
some nonsense text but you get the idea

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.840 
some nonsense text but you get the idea
more<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.270> less<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.810> text<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:02.370> text<00:03:02.400> field

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
more or less the text is the text field

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.790 
more or less the text is the text field
is<00:03:03.230> well<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.740> fairly<00:03:05.040> um<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:07.350> allows<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.740> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
is well it's fairly um it allows you to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.350 
is well it's fairly um it allows you to
create<00:03:08.130> as<00:03:08.280> much<00:03:08.400> text<00:03:08.820> as<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.210> like

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
