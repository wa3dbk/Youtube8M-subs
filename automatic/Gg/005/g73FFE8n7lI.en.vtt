cage<00:00:20.449> I<00:00:21.449> guess<00:00:21.900> I'll<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.199> off<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
cage I guess I'll start off with the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.720 
cage I guess I'll start off with the
tour<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:24.269> showing<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.840> her<00:00:25.109> basking<00:00:25.680> spot

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
tour by showing you her basking spot

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
tour by showing you her basking spot
which<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:27.210> four<00:00:27.599> feet<00:00:27.779> long<00:00:28.189> she<00:00:29.189> can

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
which is about four feet long she can

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.759 
which is about four feet long she can
either<00:00:29.400> choose<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:30.119> basking<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.140> slate

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
either choose from basking on the slate

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.170 
either choose from basking on the slate
tiles<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> wood<00:00:33.829> she<00:00:34.829> usually<00:00:35.010> Basques<00:00:35.820> on

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

tiles or the wood she usually Basques on
the<00:00:36.360> slate<00:00:36.630> tiles<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the slate tiles because these get up to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
the slate tiles because these get up to
about<00:00:38.750> 130<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.050> 135<00:00:40.770> compared<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.050> 125

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
about 130 to 135 compared to the 125

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
about 130 to 135 compared to the 125
that<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> gets<00:00:43.890> sob<00:00:44.219> -<00:00:45.770> these<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:46.950> heated<00:00:47.250> up

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that that gets sob - these are heated up

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
that that gets sob - these are heated up
by<00:00:47.899> 375<00:00:48.899> watt<00:00:49.260> halogen<00:00:49.559> light<00:00:50.039> bulbs<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.840> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
by 375 watt halogen light bulbs and I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
by 375 watt halogen light bulbs and I
also<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.980> fluorescent<00:00:53.550> strip<00:00:54.059> bulbs

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
also have two fluorescent strip bulbs

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.040 
also have two fluorescent strip bulbs
one<00:00:55.140> giving<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.620> UV<00:00:56.420> although<00:00:57.420> monitors

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one giving off UV although monitors

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.459 
one giving off UV although monitors
don't<00:00:58.440> need<00:00:58.920> UV<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.699> give<00:00:59.940> Savannah<00:01:00.359> UV<00:01:00.809> because

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
don't need UV I give Savannah UV because

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
don't need UV I give Savannah UV because
it<00:01:01.559> makes<00:01:01.739> her<00:01:01.890> colors<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.550> brighter<00:01:02.989> not

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it makes her colors much brighter not

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
it makes her colors much brighter not
sure<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> camera<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.780> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
sure if the camera can get that but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
sure if the camera can get that but
before<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.890> giving<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> her<00:01:08.520> she<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
before I was giving in to her she was a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.609 
before I was giving in to her she was a
much<00:01:09.780> darker<00:01:10.140> color<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:13.170> something

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
much darker color I have something

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.990 
much darker color I have something
measuring<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> temperature<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> humidity

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
height is about 70 degrees right now I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719 
height is about 70 degrees right now I
only<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.990> six<00:01:34.500> inches<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.070> substrate

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
only have about six inches of substrate

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.069 
only have about six inches of substrate
but<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.780> she<00:01:36.960> gets<00:01:37.079> bigger<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> add

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
but as she gets bigger I'm going to add

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.889 
but as she gets bigger I'm going to add
more<00:01:40.079> substrate<00:01:40.740> feet<00:01:41.540> at<00:01:42.540> least<00:01:42.930> 18<00:01:43.590> inches<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
more substrate feet at least 18 inches I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
more substrate feet at least 18 inches I
would<00:01:45.899> prefer<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.710> 24<00:01:47.280> inches<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
would prefer to have 24 inches of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.260 
would prefer to have 24 inches of
substrate<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:49.350> we'll<00:01:50.100> see

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
substrate but we'll see

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.810 
substrate but we'll see
even<00:01:52.020> though<00:01:52.170> Savannah<00:01:52.619> monitors<00:01:52.829> don't

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
even though Savannah monitors don't

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.410 
even though Savannah monitors don't
usually<00:01:54.270> swim<00:01:54.990> around<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> water<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.820> sit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
usually swim around in the water or sit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
usually swim around in the water or sit
there<00:01:57.689> much<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.740> good<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.490> large

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
there much it's good to have a large

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.069 
there much it's good to have a large
water<00:02:00.450> dish<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:03.270> helps<00:02:03.659> keep<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
water dish because is it helps keep the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.029 
water dish because is it helps keep the
humidity<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.549> proper<00:02:06.619> 60%<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.829> they
