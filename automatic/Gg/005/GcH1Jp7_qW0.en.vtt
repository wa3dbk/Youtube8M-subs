and this is to the build chain phase

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.600 
and this is to the build chain phase
lock<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.840> high<00:00:54.840> survivability<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.520> know

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
lock and high survivability and you know

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
lock and high survivability and you know
you're<00:00:56.789> also<00:00:56.940> doing<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:58.350> good<00:00:58.500> amount<00:00:58.829> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
damage with the phase locks just crushed

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
damage with the phase locks just crushed
and<00:01:00.840> shit<00:01:01.079> um<00:01:01.640> I'm<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> call<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and shit um I'm not going to call it a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.880 
and shit um I'm not going to call it a
fit<00:01:03.449> any<00:01:03.629> phase<00:01:03.840> lock<00:01:04.110> anymore<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:04.680> it's

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
fit any phase lock anymore because it's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
fit any phase lock anymore because it's
not<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.339> quite<00:01:05.580> infinity<00:01:06.320> or<00:01:07.320> infinite

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
not really quite infinity or infinite

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
all right so start with this tree and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.620 
all right so start with this tree and
you<00:01:31.369> know<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.729> pretty<00:01:31.909> toughening<00:01:32.360> start

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
you know it's pretty toughening start

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.370 
you know it's pretty toughening start
out<00:01:32.750> hard<00:01:33.079> mode<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.219> start<00:01:34.490> off<00:01:34.610> here<00:01:35.259> you<00:01:36.259> know

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
out hard mode so start off here you know

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.719 
out hard mode so start off here you know
get<00:01:36.619> all<00:01:36.770> these<00:01:36.979> don't<00:01:37.850> put<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.539> point<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.990> here

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
get all these don't put a point in here

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.359 
get all these don't put a point in here
restoration<00:01:40.729> save<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.560> you'll<00:01:42.560> be<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:45.340> say<00:01:46.340> I

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
them before when i started off hard mode

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.010 
them before when i started off hard mode
and<00:01:52.310> then<00:01:52.819> one<00:01:53.209> in<00:01:53.420> res<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.640> then<00:01:56.020> more

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then one in res and then more

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.300 
and then one in res and then more
importantly<00:01:57.079> when<00:01:57.590> i<00:01:57.619> try<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.860> get<00:01:57.950> down<00:01:58.159> this

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
one and this one fully done as quick as

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.270 
one and this one fully done as quick as
possible<00:02:19.190> especially<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:20.709> they<00:02:21.709> like

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
possible especially this one they like

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.740 
possible especially this one they like
when<00:02:22.400> they<00:02:22.459> die<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.760> phase<00:02:23.150> lock<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.629> will

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
when they die in phase lock it will

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.910 
when they die in phase lock it will
travel<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.230> another<00:02:24.530> one<00:02:24.829> and<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.650> thing<00:02:27.889> is

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
travel to another one and the thing is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.289 
travel to another one and the thing is
though<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.880> reason<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.269> not

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
though is like the reason it's not

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.400 
though is like the reason it's not
infinite<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:29.989> because<00:02:30.139> even<00:02:30.290> though<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
infinite it's because even though it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.960 
infinite it's because even though it
travels<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.829> another<00:02:31.040> one<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.549> kill<00:02:31.790> them

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
travels to another one and you kill them

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.030 
travels to another one and you kill them
it<00:02:32.239> might<00:02:32.359> travel<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> third<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:33.920> then

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
it might travel to a third but then

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.590 
it might travel to a third but then
after<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.370> kill<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.579> third<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.389> kind

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
after you kill the third like it's kind

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.900 
after you kill the third like it's kind
of<00:02:35.660> time<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.889> thing<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.489> when<00:02:37.609> you<00:02:37.760> got
