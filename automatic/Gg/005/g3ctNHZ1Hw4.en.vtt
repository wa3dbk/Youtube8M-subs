thing that I think most fitness skaters
in<00:00:13.830> marathons<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.790> neglect<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.509> race

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
in marathons get is neglect is race

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.740 
in marathons get is neglect is race

powerslide team and stuff like that we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.740 
powerslide team and stuff like that we
go<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.980> race<00:00:23.460> tactics<00:00:23.939> designed<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.539> win

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
thing that I wanted to stress is maybe

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.299 
thing that I wanted to stress is maybe
your<00:00:35.630> maybe<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.870> tactic<00:00:37.350> isn't<00:00:37.710> when<00:00:38.160> you're

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
your maybe your tactic isn't when you're

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
your maybe your tactic isn't when you're
going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> launch<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.969> pack<00:00:39.540> sprint<00:00:39.930> against

break away from Felix halfway through

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
break away from Felix halfway through
the<00:00:43.920> race<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.329> very<00:00:45.570> simple<00:00:45.960> things

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the race it's it's very simple things

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
the race it's it's very simple things
that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> guys<00:00:46.620> should<00:00:46.920> consider<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that you guys should consider like for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.540 
that you guys should consider like for
example<00:00:48.110> maybe<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.530> 10<00:00:49.800> kilometers<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
example maybe the first 10 kilometers I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
example maybe the first 10 kilometers I
just<00:00:50.789> relaxed<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> pack<00:00:51.899> try<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.559> keep<00:00:52.649> my

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
just relaxed in the pack try and keep my

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
just relaxed in the pack try and keep my
heart<00:00:53.039> rate<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> certain<00:00:53.910> level<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.570> then

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
heart rate to a certain level or then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
heart rate to a certain level or then
like<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> last<00:00:55.940> 20<00:00:56.940> kilometers<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.480> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like the last 20 kilometers I'm just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.569 
like the last 20 kilometers I'm just
gonna<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.050> fast<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:59.129> things<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
gonna go as fast as I can or things like

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
gonna go as fast as I can or things like
that<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.840> practice<00:01:01.379> these<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that so really practice these kind of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
that so really practice these kind of
things<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.250> training<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.840> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
things in training so that then when you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
things in training so that then when you
get<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.379> marathon<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:05.270> capable<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
get in your marathon you're capable of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.440 
get in your marathon you're capable of
doing<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.200> maximum<00:01:07.710> possible<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.700> even

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
doing the maximum possible because even

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
doing the maximum possible because even
though<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.500> things<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
though it's a little little things and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
though it's a little little things and
for<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> guys<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.180> pacing<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for you guys it's more about pacing and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
for you guys it's more about pacing and
things<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.270> ultimately<00:01:15.270> it'll<00:01:15.509> allow

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
things like that ultimately it'll allow

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.539 
things like that ultimately it'll allow
you<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> personal<00:01:16.710> best<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.340> for

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you to get a personal best because for

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
you to get a personal best because for
example<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> could<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.780> stronger<00:01:19.439> through

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
example you could be stronger through

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.240 
example you could be stronger through
the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.640> 30<00:01:20.909> kilometers<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.590> save<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the first 30 kilometers and just save a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
the first 30 kilometers and just save a
little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> reserve<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.299> those<00:01:24.420> last<00:01:24.689> 10

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
little bit and reserve for those last 10

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.609 
little bit and reserve for those last 10
kilometers

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
kilometers

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
kilometers
obviously<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> tactics<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> limitless<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
obviously the tactics are limitless I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.429 
obviously the tactics are limitless I
mean<00:01:28.490> when<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.820> hard<00:01:30.090> went<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.229> hard

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
mean when to go hard went to not go hard

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
mean when to go hard went to not go hard
and<00:01:31.619> obviously<00:01:32.210> experience<00:01:33.210> counts<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and obviously experience counts for a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200 
and obviously experience counts for a
lot<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.400> marathon<00:01:35.970> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
lot so when you first marathon it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.319 
lot so when you first marathon it's
little<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:37.400> every<00:01:38.400> 15<00:01:38.909> minutes<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
little things like every 15 minutes I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.810 
little things like every 15 minutes I
want<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> drink<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> halfway

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
want to have a drink and then it halfway

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.389 
want to have a drink and then it halfway
I'm<00:01:42.329> gonna<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.720> my<00:01:42.840> energy<00:01:43.170> gel<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.159> these

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
I'm gonna take my energy gel but these

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm gonna take my energy gel but these
are<00:01:44.610> little<00:01:44.820> things<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.240> tactics<00:01:45.869> which

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
are little things that tactics which

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
are little things that tactics which
maybe<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.850> neglect<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> forget<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> put<00:01:48.750> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
maybe you neglect and forget to put in
