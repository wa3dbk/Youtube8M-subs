00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
found it was is it were the just a good

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.059 
found it was is it were the just a good
job<00:01:59.470> on<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.679> surface<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:02.829> see<00:02:03.039> I

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
job on the surface as you can see I

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.219 
job on the surface as you can see I
wheels<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.520> today<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> little<00:02:04.840> bit<00:02:05.020> dumb

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
wheels it today is a little bit dumb

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.590 
wheels it today is a little bit dumb
how's<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.310> left<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.640> few<00:02:06.850> bits<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.329> board

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
how's the left a few bits on board

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.559 
how's the left a few bits on board
because<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.440> will<00:02:08.590> clean<00:02:08.830> job<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.420> opens<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
because it will clean job and opens the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.900 
because it will clean job and opens the
surface<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.470> reason<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.670> we've

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
surface so the reason we like we've

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.430 
surface so the reason we like we've
purchased<00:02:13.480> were<00:02:14.250> decisis<00:02:15.250> areas<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:17.230> this

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
purchased were decisis areas with this

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.030 
purchased were decisis areas with this
the<00:02:18.040> air<00:02:18.190> decisis<00:02:19.030> obviously<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.630> get<00:02:20.040> can

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
the air decisis obviously you get can

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.059 
the air decisis obviously you get can
put<00:02:21.250> different<00:02:21.400> times<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.959> get<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.830> solid

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
put different times on and get the solid

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.729 
put different times on and get the solid
tax<00:02:24.370> will<00:02:24.580> jump<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:26.319> get<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> air

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
tax will jump it on now and get the air

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.070 
tax will jump it on now and get the air
air<00:02:26.980> times<00:02:27.340> which<00:02:28.000> are<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.480> time<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.989> are

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
air times which are the time that are

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.190 
air times which are the time that are
opened<00:02:29.440> up<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.940> area<00:02:31.390> machine<00:02:32.099> blast<00:02:34.200> blast

opened up this area machine blast blast

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.059 
opened up this area machine blast blast
of<00:02:35.440> adding<00:02:35.769> at<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.150> subsurface<00:02:37.920> damage<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
of adding at a subsurface damage to

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.229 
of adding at a subsurface damage to
roads<00:02:39.250> where<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.670> need<00:02:39.880> it

roads where you need it

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.770 
roads where you need it
they<00:02:41.110> also<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:42.120> feel<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:45.180> being<00:02:46.180> compacts<00:02:46.630> a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
they also I feel just being compacts a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.740 
they also I feel just being compacts a
surface<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.829> little<00:02:48.100> bit

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.229 

one<00:02:52.439> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.620> reasons<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.610> Jack's<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> air

one of the reasons in Jack's in the air

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.360 
one of the reasons in Jack's in the air
is<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.569> get<00:02:54.719> in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> air<00:02:55.109> direct<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.280> the

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
have found is you need to keep the time

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.680 
have found is you need to keep the time
I<00:04:18.449> was<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:19.560> clean<00:04:19.799> so
