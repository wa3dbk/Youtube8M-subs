00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey guys welcome to your Xcode for

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey guys welcome to your Xcode for
tutorials<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.090> with<00:00:03.600> Jake<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.080> bring

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
tutorials here with Jake and my bring

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.930 
tutorials here with Jake and my bring
back<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.890> today<00:00:05.520> we're<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.819> go<00:00:05.910> over

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
back and today we're going to go over

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.900 
back and today we're going to go over
the<00:00:06.150> aarc<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.529> if<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.519> don't<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.760> what<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
the aarc and if you don't know what the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.060 
the aarc and if you don't know what the
aarc<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:09.840> basically<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.320> automatic

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
aarc is it's basically the automatic

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.970 
aarc is it's basically the automatic
reference<00:00:11.400> counting<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.679> you've<00:00:13.679> probably

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
reference counting and you've probably

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
reference counting and you've probably
seen<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.370> past<00:00:14.700> tutorials<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.540> know<00:00:15.630> we've

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
seen the past tutorials you know we've

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.010 
seen the past tutorials you know we've
kind<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.020> blown<00:00:16.440> through<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:18.180> set<00:00:18.930> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
kind of blown through this first set of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
kind of blown through this first set of
options<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.220> yeah<00:00:20.490> just

good for it well I want to go in and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.370 
good for it well I want to go in and
explain<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.039> aarc<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.170> you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
explain what the aarc is and so as you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.429 
explain what the aarc is and so as you
guys<00:00:28.529> click<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.460> unchecked<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.230> may

guys click this or unchecked it you may

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
guys click this or unchecked it you may
have<00:00:31.590> seen<00:00:31.769> some<00:00:32.009> stuff<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.369> our<00:00:32.550> coding<00:00:33.000> how

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
have seen some stuff from our coding how

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
have seen some stuff from our coding how
it<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.930> different<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:34.410> how

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it was a little bit different from how

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.180 
it was a little bit different from how
it<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.500> that's<00:00:37.500> that's<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it is now and that's that's what the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.389 
it is now and that's that's what the
aarc<00:00:38.610> does<00:00:38.930> they<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.739> basically<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
aarc does they are see is is basically a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.869 
aarc does they are see is is basically a
memory<00:00:41.760> management<00:00:42.270> thing<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.280> it's<00:00:44.280> new<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
memory management thing and it's new to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
memory management thing and it's new to
xcode<00:00:45.270> four<00:00:45.510> point<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> which<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.530> makes<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
xcode four point to which it makes it a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
xcode four point to which it makes it a
little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.059> simpler<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
little bit more simpler now some of the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
little bit more simpler now some of the
more<00:00:49.500> advanced<00:00:49.829> programmers<00:00:50.399> gone<00:00:50.610> oh<00:00:50.850> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
more advanced programmers gone oh this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
more advanced programmers gone oh this
is<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> joke<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.500> makes<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> easier

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
is a joke you know just makes it easier

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a joke you know just makes it easier
for<00:00:53.430> programmers<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.530> worry

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
for programmers to you know not worry

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
for programmers to you know not worry
about<00:00:55.920> memory<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> stuff<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.000> well

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
about memory and stuff like that well

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.040 
about memory and stuff like that well
yeah<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.239> also<00:01:00.570> helps<00:01:00.870> us

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
yeah so it is but also it also helps us

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
yeah so it is but also it also helps us
newer<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.370> know<00:01:02.489> some<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> newer

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
newer you know some of the newer

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.420 
newer you know some of the newer
programmers<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> grasp<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
programmers out there to get a grasp of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
programmers out there to get a grasp of
what's<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:07.590> know<00:01:07.710> develop

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
what's going on and you know develop

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
what's going on and you know develop
programs<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.659> two-sided

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
programs you know so it's a two-sided

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.539 
programs you know so it's a two-sided
sword<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:11.119> anyways<00:01:12.140> what<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> aarc<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
sword there anyways what the aarc is is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
sword there anyways what the aarc is is
it's<00:01:14.880> basically<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.450> new<00:01:15.600> compiler<00:01:16.110> feature

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's basically a new compiler feature

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's basically a new compiler feature
and<00:01:17.009> within<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.900> allows<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.409> memory

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and within this it it allows the memory

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
and within this it it allows the memory
management<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> objects<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> stuff<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
management of the objects and stuff it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
management of the objects and stuff it
kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> handles<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
kind of handles it you know as it is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.740 
kind of handles it you know as it is
that's<00:01:25.470> why<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.460> automatic<00:01:27.180> instead<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's why they put automatic instead of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.550 
that's why they put automatic instead of
manual<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:30.450> rather<00:01:31.170> than

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
manual and so basically rather than

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
manual and so basically rather than
having<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
having to think about the you know the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.679 
having to think about the you know the
retainer<00:01:33.869> release<00:01:34.460> operations<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.880> objects

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
retainer release operations of objects

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
retainer release operations of objects
now<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.500> basically<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.310> concentrate<00:01:39.299> on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
now you basically just concentrate on

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
now you basically just concentrate on
the<00:01:39.930> core<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> coding<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.680> know

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the core of the coding and so you know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
the core of the coding and so you know
as<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.950> develop<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.549> projects<00:01:45.119> we're<00:01:45.540> just

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
as you develop your projects we're just

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.480 
as you develop your projects we're just
going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.500> something<00:01:47.060> test<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to put in here something test here

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.639 
going to put in here something test here
you<00:01:50.490> develop<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:50.909> projects<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.750> guess<00:01:52.470> we've

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you develop your projects I guess we've

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.530 
you develop your projects I guess we've
already<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> test<00:01:53.369> test<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.000> three

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
already got a test test one two three

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.060 
already got a test test one two three
and<00:01:56.040> we'll<00:01:57.040> get<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.340> going<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.830> basically

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and we'll get that going so it basically

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.480 
and we'll get that going so it basically
makes<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.150> coating<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:03.160> memory

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
makes the coating and the memory

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.910 
makes the coating and the memory
management<00:02:03.970> not<00:02:04.510> as<00:02:04.780> much<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.290> headache<00:02:05.500> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
management not as much of a headache and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.040 
management not as much of a headache and
so<00:02:06.580> that's<00:02:06.730> what<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:06.940> want<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.270> explain<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.930> you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
so that's what I want to explain to you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.680 
so that's what I want to explain to you
now<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.229> as<00:02:08.679> we<00:02:08.830> go<00:02:08.979> through<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.580> let's<00:02:10.509> see

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
now so as we go through and let's see

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.400 
now so as we go through and let's see
you<00:02:10.840> go<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.110> your<00:02:11.380> implementation<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:14.260> go

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
you go to your implementation and you go

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.910 
you go to your implementation and you go
down<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.550> see<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> void<00:02:16.920> deallocate

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
down you you don't see a void deallocate

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.370 
down you you don't see a void deallocate
and<00:02:18.460> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> past<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.750> would<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.230> would

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and in the past you would you would

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.860 
and in the past you would you would
allocate<00:02:21.220> an<00:02:21.370> object<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.750> would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
allocate an object and then you would

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.210 
allocate an object and then you would
have<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.080> go<00:02:23.290> through<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.740> you'd<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
have to go through and you'd have to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.640 
have to go through and you'd have to
release<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.610> object<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.780> wouldn't<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.410> tied

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
release that object so wouldn't get tied

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.680 
release that object so wouldn't get tied
up<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.980> memory<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.610> cause<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
up in the memory and cause the the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.180 
up in the memory and cause the the
application<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> crash<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> all<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.070> stuff

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
application to crash and all that stuff

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.570 
application to crash and all that stuff
so<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:32.800> it's<00:02:32.890> about<00:02:33.040> now<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
so that's kind of what it's about now I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.050 
so that's kind of what it's about now I
brought<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.580> aarc<00:02:36.580> from<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
brought up here the aarc from the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.810 
brought up here the aarc from the
developer<00:02:37.540> apple<00:02:37.990> site<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.520> know<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
developer apple site and you know the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.730 
developer apple site and you know the
it's<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.270> beautiful<00:02:40.690> chart<00:02:40.990> because<00:02:41.320> they<00:02:41.620> go

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
it's a beautiful chart because they go

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.560 
it's a beautiful chart because they go
from<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.070> manual<00:02:42.550> reference<00:02:43.000> counting<00:02:43.390> which

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
from the manual reference counting which

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.690 
from the manual reference counting which
this<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:44.560> used<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.340> is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
this is what we used to have to do is

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.430 
this is what we used to have to do is
you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> you'd<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> retain<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.380> you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
you know you'd have to retain and you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680 
you know you'd have to retain and you
have<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.680> release<00:02:48.040> your<00:02:48.370> memory<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
have to release your memory and all that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.540 
have to release your memory and all that
stuff<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.230> see<00:02:50.470> how<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.310> would<00:02:51.430> just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
stuff and you see how like it would just

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.610 
stuff and you see how like it would just
take<00:02:51.670> an<00:02:52.270> immense<00:02:52.720> amount<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.110> time<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.500> go

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
take an immense amount of time to go

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.040 
take an immense amount of time to go
through<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:53.920> figure<00:02:54.160> all<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.400> stuff<00:02:54.580> out<00:02:55.050> to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
through and figure all that stuff out to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.080 
through and figure all that stuff out to
now<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.800> they<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.310> put<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.030> new

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
now when they they put in this new

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.110 
now when they they put in this new
automatic<00:02:58.810> reference<00:02:59.200> counting<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.950> now<00:03:00.820> it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
automatic reference counting and now it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.270 
automatic reference counting and now it
takes<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.720> half<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
takes you know half the you know the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.030 
takes you know half the you know the
quarter<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.940> time<00:03:04.150> was<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:05.560> develop<00:03:05.800> these

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
quarter the time was to develop these

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.790 
quarter the time was to develop these
applications<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:07.750> that's<00:03:08.320> kind<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
applications so that's kind of the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.240 
applications so that's kind of the
basics<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> aarc<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.380> kind<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.830> gives<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
basics to the aarc and kind of gives you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.810 
basics to the aarc and kind of gives you
a<00:03:12.280> brief<00:03:12.910> overview<00:03:13.209> as<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.250> know<00:03:15.280> how<00:03:15.670> much

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
a brief overview as to you know how much

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.699 
a brief overview as to you know how much
easier<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.750> guys<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.470> get<00:03:17.590> out

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
easier it is for you guys just get out

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.490 
easier it is for you guys just get out
there<00:03:17.739> put<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> code<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.320> to

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
there put in the code you not have to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.949 
there put in the code you not have to
met<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:21.070> know<00:03:21.190> mess<00:03:21.580> as<00:03:21.850> much<00:03:22.330> with<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> memory

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
met you know mess as much with a memory

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.660 
met you know mess as much with a memory
management<00:03:23.470> now<00:03:23.799> don't<00:03:24.340> get<00:03:24.489> me<00:03:24.640> wrong

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
management now don't get me wrong

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.430 
management now don't get me wrong
there's<00:03:25.239> still<00:03:25.570> some<00:03:25.810> memory<00:03:26.049> management

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
there's still some memory management

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.340 
there's still some memory management
stuff<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.860> have<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:26.980> work<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.360> definitely

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
stuff you have to work on but definitely

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.470 
stuff you have to work on but definitely
takes<00:03:29.530> out<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.739> core<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.330> guys

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
takes out the core of that so you guys

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.210 
takes out the core of that so you guys
can<00:03:31.690> develop<00:03:32.080> these<00:03:32.200> applications<00:03:32.920> quickly

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
can develop these applications quickly

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.770 
can develop these applications quickly
and<00:03:33.750> efficiently<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:37.209> kind<00:03:37.570> of<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and efficiently so that's kind of the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.640 
and efficiently so that's kind of the
aarc<00:03:38.739> hopefully<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.700> guys<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.230> don't

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
aarc hopefully you guys you know don't

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.259 
aarc hopefully you guys you know don't
get<00:03:41.799> too<00:03:41.980> tied<00:03:42.220> up<00:03:42.400> with<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.640> if<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:42.970> do<00:03:43.120> have

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
get too tied up with that if you do have
