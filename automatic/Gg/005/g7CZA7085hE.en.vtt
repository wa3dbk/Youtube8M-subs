some of these guys all right here we go
this<00:00:46.140> question<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.010> that's<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this question for that's to go in the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:00.490 
this question for that's to go in the
day<00:00:48.210> here

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.890

so these guys are moving up from here

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.730 
so these guys are moving up from here
looks<00:01:03.170> pretty<00:01:03.350> even

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.260 

maybe<00:01:06.280> Lane<00:01:06.550> six<00:01:06.940> making<00:01:07.270> up<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.480> ground

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
