00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.519

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.729

 canaries you can catch the two 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 obviously I like the inscription 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 because that's what the video is like so 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.979

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.860
 last sheet 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.350
 now we 're going to go to the middle to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.619
 also the square does not need to leave 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.640
 we will have to go with m to see that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.190
 he is also useful 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.640

 red on the floor or you have to get on one 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 of the horses to make it appear 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.710
 attentive there is 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.210
 the swing there we have the brick but 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.210
 and now if we buy for 200,000 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.850
 red brick detector that in my 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.520
 opinion is a pretty useless brick 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.700
 but you need to get the hundred 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.800
 Per hundred worth this is all for now 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.130
