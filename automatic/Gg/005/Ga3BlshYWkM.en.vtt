00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 if you are videogamers you will have 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.240
 definitely heard of at least one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 turn of easter egg for the less experienced 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 it is bizarre content that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 are inserted in videogames dai 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.179
 programmers and often do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 reference to things like other videogames 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 movies or facts that really happened o 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.910
 maybe they are just crazy things 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.250
 enter a little so by chance and by 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 fun in the history of videogames 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.390
 they were actually made of it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 ingenious and today you can start one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 collection that I will then carry on 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 next videos of those that are there 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.030
 loved most of all let's not get lost in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 chat we start right away from the first 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 of course you all know mine 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 passion for dark souls no I could not 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.309
 so that start with something that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 covered the title of from software 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 probably many of you who have 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.329
 played Borderlands 2 will be lost 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 this pearl you see that island in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:00.770
 sea ​​of ​​acid we reach the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:06.060
 quickly and want to recognize it 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:10.760
 the bonfire of dark souls this guy 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.760
 sitting soul eater 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.260
 well i think i don't need to tell you to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 I know who inspired it, but I remain 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.760
 always in the world of borderlands 2 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 there is something in the same area 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.890
 of equally inspired so many 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.990
 look at these blocks 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.550
 minecraft is what can be expected behind 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:46.390
 if not a horde of angry creepers 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:48.280
 fuck there is not even a giant level 7 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.560
 of aliens colonial marines 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.050
 let's face it a game rather 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.300
 less disappointing than the fate of the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.700
 series have been recently 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 raised by the new title v faq that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300
 what is that 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.580
 serious sam 3 one's favorite game 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:19.590
 youtuber rather famous in Italy 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:21.720
 let's see what happens in this area there 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.190
 see these faces in practice are i 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.190
 faces of the game developers 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 ale oo you would say a spin off of the saga 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890
 taylor in which we could impersonate the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.450
 team members or st and play 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.350
 then the game a little more 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.770
 stealth 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.770
 I'd say let's take a ride oh my god 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.730
 but have you ever wondered how i 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.560
 protagonists of assassin's creed 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.620
 could survive those flights 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 absurdly well evidently the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.690
 the witcher 2 developers are 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.690
 the same question is asked here 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.510
 but what the fuck is going on 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.510
 ok an easter egg a little more serious 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 look at this newspaper that appears in 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.450
 uncharted 3 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.250
 talk about scientists who apparently 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.660
 try to find the cure for one 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.420
 pandemic started from a fungus is not that 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.890
 reminds you of something 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.630
 the beauty of this easter egg that 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.480
 something went wrong in the plans of the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.610
 developers in fact when lists rai fu 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.250
 conceived it was supposed to be from a vast vase 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.650
 should have already been announced 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.080
 instead the announcement of the game was delayed 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.180
 however this newspaper was not removed 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.250
 from uncharted 3 is for those who played the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.050
 title so there was no possibility of 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.140
 seize the reference if not precisely 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.060
 after several months 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.760
 ok ready to take out this guy in 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.590
 cat med cup solution but first I want 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.000
 be bad and you want to kill them all 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.000
 those eagles around here 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 ok now your you no okay goodbye 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.180
 ok come on wait for one like this 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.039
 we get to 10 since today I feel 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.199
 particularly good I want to close 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.360
 with a message of peace 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.729
 know that even the most terrible enemies 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.219
 they can ultimately bury 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.559
 the hatchet but remember in taylor 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.120
 combat evolved the first title of the 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.460
 saga when it has to explode 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.050
 the spaceship from which we started 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.059
 well if you have finished the game has 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:18.240
