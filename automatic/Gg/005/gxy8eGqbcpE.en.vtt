area<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:09.679> there<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> poisonous<00:00:12.240> I

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
area that I there was like a poisonous I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.840 
area that I there was like a poisonous I
felt<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.950> did<00:00:14.330> this<00:00:15.330> area<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:16.590> Paso<00:00:17.220> or

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
felt that I did this area like Paso or

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.540 
felt that I did this area like Paso or
pretty<00:00:18.270> fast<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.990> then<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.800> don't<00:00:20.310> want

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
pretty fast and then I just don't want

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
pretty fast and then I just don't want
to<00:00:20.640> miss<00:00:22.430> items<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.180> guess<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.590> splode

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to miss items so I guess want to splode

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.669 
to miss items so I guess want to splode
a<00:00:26.430> little<00:00:26.820> bit<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:30.080> what<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.439> get

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
a little bit more and see what can I get

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.030 
a little bit more and see what can I get
because<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.930> managed<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> Kia<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
because I managed to get a Kia I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.110 
because I managed to get a Kia I
remember<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.450> name<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.590> key<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
remember the name of the key but it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.750 
remember the name of the key but it
seems<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:40.340> pretty<00:00:41.340> important<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.469> perhaps

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
seems like pretty important and perhaps

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.200 
seems like pretty important and perhaps
there<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.390> cool<00:00:45.660> items<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> yeah<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
let me take that first and I believe

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.139
