things covered and the last bit that you
want<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> concealed<00:01:38.790> weapon<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
want in a concealed weapon is

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
want in a concealed weapon is
effectiveness<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.549> we'll<00:01:41.670> talk<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
effectiveness and we'll talk about that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
effectiveness and we'll talk about that
whole<00:01:42.450> aspect<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.680> second<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.250> first

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
whole aspect in a second but first

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
whole aspect in a second but first
Curtis<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> big<00:01:45.960> reveal<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
Curtis when we do the big reveal and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
Curtis when we do the big reveal and
when<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.920> show<00:01:47.100> us<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.460> 33<00:01:48.060> inch<00:01:48.210> blade<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
when we show us this 33 inch blade a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
when we show us this 33 inch blade a
vendor<00:01:49.409> person<00:01:49.680> another<00:01:49.950> aspect<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
vendor person another aspect of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
vendor person another aspect of
obviously<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> concealed<00:01:51.630> abilities<00:01:52.049> access

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
obviously the concealed abilities access

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
obviously the concealed abilities access
and<00:01:53.180> deployment<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> weapon<00:01:55.140> doesn't

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and deployment if the weapon doesn't

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
and deployment if the weapon doesn't
deploy<00:01:55.680> instantaneously<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.479> your

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
deploy instantaneously then your

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
deploy instantaneously then your
attacker<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> obviously<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
attacker is going to obviously get the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
attacker is going to obviously get the
upper<00:01:59.729> hand<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:00.899> someone's<00:02:01.200> going

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
upper hand and so when someone's going

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.020 
upper hand and so when someone's going
for<00:02:01.530> their<00:02:01.619> weapon<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> gun<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.640> whatever<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
for their weapon or a gun or whatever it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
for their weapon or a gun or whatever it
is<00:02:03.119> close<00:02:03.719> quarter<00:02:04.049> battle<00:02:04.079> situations<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
is close quarter battle situations you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.859 
is close quarter battle situations you
need<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> strike<00:02:05.939> first<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.540> my<00:02:06.630> situation

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
need to strike first so in my situation

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.309 
need to strike first so in my situation
I<00:02:07.409> simply<00:02:07.920> deploy<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I simply deploy it like this and at that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
I simply deploy it like this and at that
moment<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.890> actually<00:02:11.039> come<00:02:11.310> across<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
moment I can actually come across and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.900 
moment I can actually come across and
strike

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
strike

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.540 
strike
Ceylan<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.590> use<00:02:14.710> any<00:02:14.830> type<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.070> technique

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
Ceylan I can use any type of technique

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.510 
Ceylan I can use any type of technique

you how this I'll let me just see the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
you how this I'll let me just see the
blade<00:02:19.900> first<00:02:20.200> sure<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.980> what<00:02:21.130> he's<00:02:21.220> deployed

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
blade first sure so what he's deployed

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.490 
blade first sure so what he's deployed
here<00:02:21.910> I'm<00:02:22.630> sure<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> pretty<00:02:23.290> good<00:02:23.410> feel

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
for this but this is a 33-inch for lack

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.690 
for this but this is a 33-inch for lack
of<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.440> better<00:02:26.530> term<00:02:26.650> right<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.040> we'll<00:02:27.430> call<00:02:27.580> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
of a better term right now we'll call it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.090 
of a better term right now we'll call it
a<00:02:27.760> machete<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.420> object<00:02:28.990> or<00:02:29.200> almost<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
a machete like object or almost the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.270 
a machete like object or almost the
shank<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> sword<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:32.890> steel

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
shank it is a sword in that it's steel

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.760 
shank it is a sword in that it's steel
it's<00:02:33.970> spring<00:02:34.360> steel<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:34.930> got<00:02:35.080> wobble<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
it's spring steel it's got wobble to it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.950 
it's spring steel it's got wobble to it
okay<00:02:36.040> we'll<00:02:36.910> talk<00:02:37.060> about<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.450> address<00:02:37.780> that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
okay we'll talk about that address that

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.370 
okay we'll talk about that address that
a<00:02:38.020> second<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.680> got<00:02:38.890> some<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.240> 511<00:02:40.870> cord<00:02:41.140> or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
a second it's got some so 511 cord or

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.960 
a second it's got some so 511 cord or
some<00:02:41.530> nylon<00:02:41.920> cord<00:02:42.190> wrapped<00:02:42.460> around<00:02:42.610> for<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
some nylon cord wrapped around for a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.940 
some nylon cord wrapped around for a
nice<00:02:43.090> grip<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.260> cord<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.770> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
nice grip you can see the cord and the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.620 
nice grip you can see the cord and the
grip<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> large<00:02:45.580> enough<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.940> accommodate<00:02:46.120> two

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
grip is large enough to accommodate two

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.570 
grip is large enough to accommodate two
hands<00:02:46.900> certainly<00:02:47.350> especially<00:02:48.280> what<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> like

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
hands certainly especially what I like

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.250 
hands certainly especially what I like
about<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.970> design<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.510> doesn't<00:02:49.930> Lee<00:02:50.110> just

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
about this design it doesn't Lee just

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.080 
about this design it doesn't Lee just
accommodate<00:02:50.770> two<00:02:50.920> hands<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.790> at<00:02:51.880> Elm

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
accommodate two hands but at Elm

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.700 
accommodate two hands but at Elm
accommodates<00:02:52.750> two<00:02:52.900> hands<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.290> some<00:02:53.410> space

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
accommodates two hands with some space

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.440 
accommodates two hands with some space
between<00:02:54.100> them<00:02:54.280> we'll<00:02:54.850> talk<00:02:55.030> about<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
between them we'll talk about that a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.240 
between them we'll talk about that a
second<00:02:55.930> too<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.170> terms<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.530> its<00:02:56.680> potential

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
second too in terms of its potential

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
second too in terms of its potential
uses<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.600> very<00:02:58.810> sharp<00:02:59.400> and<00:03:00.400> it's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
uses but it's very sharp and it's

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.700 
uses but it's very sharp and it's
flexible<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:01.870> let's<00:03:02.140> talk<00:03:02.320> about<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
flexible so let's talk about that

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.530 
flexible so let's talk about that
flexibility<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.550> well<00:03:03.820> every<00:03:04.150> sword<00:03:04.420> is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
flexibility a bit well every sword is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.580 
flexibility a bit well every sword is
different<00:03:04.870> well<00:03:04.960> I'm<00:03:05.020> gonna<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.260> 18

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
different well I'm gonna have 18

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.840 
different well I'm gonna have 18
different<00:03:05.770> variations<00:03:06.430> some<00:03:06.610> are<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.790> to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
different variations some are going to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.790 
different variations some are going to
be<00:03:06.940> more<00:03:07.150> flexible<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.690> where<00:03:07.960> some<00:03:08.620> are<00:03:08.650> going

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
be more flexible to where some are going

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.380 
be more flexible to where some are going
to<00:03:08.860> be<00:03:08.920> stiffer<00:03:09.310> depending<00:03:09.850> upon<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.210> person

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
to be stiffer depending upon the person

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.660 
to be stiffer depending upon the person
rather<00:03:11.110> than<00:03:11.380> trying<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.710> get<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.100> individual

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
rather than trying to get the individual

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.930 
rather than trying to get the individual
-<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.780> guess<00:03:14.620> adapt<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> sword<00:03:15.460> our

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
- I guess adapt to the sword our

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.640 
- I guess adapt to the sword our
philosophy<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.630> get<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.990> sword<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.380> adapt

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
philosophy is to get the sword to adapt

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
philosophy is to get the sword to adapt
specifically<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.550> size<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> person

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
specifically to the size of the person

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.630 
specifically to the size of the person
the<00:03:20.560> environment<00:03:20.709> they're<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.490> in

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
the environment they're going to be in

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.940 
the environment they're going to be in
and<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:22.300> course<00:03:22.510> their<00:03:22.959> level<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.440> expertise

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
and of course their level of expertise

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.070 
and of course their level of expertise
so<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:24.910> case<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.390> sword<00:03:25.600> has<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> little

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
so in this case this sword has a little

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.690 
so in this case this sword has a little
bit<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> slight<00:03:27.400> more<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.330> flex<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.440> it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
bit of a slight more of a flex to it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.740 
bit of a slight more of a flex to it
rather<00:03:30.700> than<00:03:30.820> calling<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.300> guess<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.660> would

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
rather than calling I guess what I would

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.540 
rather than calling I guess what I would
call<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.200> we<00:03:32.380> call<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.890> razor<00:03:33.160> sword

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
call this we call it a razor sword

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.300 
call this we call it a razor sword
because<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.780> middle<00:03:35.020> is<00:03:35.080> extremely<00:03:35.530> thin<00:03:35.770> we

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
because the middle is extremely thin we

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.620 
because the middle is extremely thin we
get<00:03:36.490> our<00:03:36.610> strength<00:03:36.910> from<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> metal<00:03:37.390> instead

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
get our strength from the metal instead

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.510 
get our strength from the metal instead
of<00:03:37.750> making<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.110> thicker<00:03:38.380> we<00:03:38.920> make<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.250> wider

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
of making it thicker we make it wider

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.520 
of making it thicker we make it wider
and<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.510> gives<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> blade<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.230> strength

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and so that gives the blade the strength

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.820 
and so that gives the blade the strength
and<00:03:41.770> also<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.730> gives<00:03:42.880> Erin<00:03:43.330> aerodynamic<00:03:44.200> it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
and also it gives Erin aerodynamic it

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.930 
and also it gives Erin aerodynamic it
can<00:03:45.010> cut<00:03:45.190> through<00:03:45.370> what<00:03:45.610> we've<00:03:45.760> done

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
can cut through what we've done

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.120 
can cut through what we've done
experiments<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.720> plywood<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.500> where<00:03:48.070> other

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
experiments with plywood and where other

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.650 
experiments with plywood and where other
blades<00:03:48.430> get<00:03:48.580> kind<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.880> stuck<00:03:49.090> not<00:03:49.330> saying<00:03:49.570> this

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
blades get kind of stuck not saying this

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.390 
blades get kind of stuck not saying this
is<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.020> same<00:03:50.200> with<00:03:50.350> flesh<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.770> mean<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.250> just

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
is the same with flesh I mean it just

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.520 
is the same with flesh I mean it just
cuts<00:03:51.640> right<00:03:51.730> through<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.239> very<00:03:52.540> deep<00:03:52.750> where

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
cuts right through it very deep where

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.810 
cuts right through it very deep where
other<00:03:53.620> blades<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.190> widely<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.610> kind<00:03:54.790> of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
other blades are so widely a kind of

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.199 
other blades are so widely a kind of
good<00:03:54.910> stuff

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
good stuff

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.570 
good stuff
the<00:03:55.630> other<00:03:55.780> side<00:03:56.020> that<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.650> context<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.459> this

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
the other side that the context of this

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.979 
the other side that the context of this
is<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.880> was<00:03:58.060> designed<00:03:58.209> also<00:03:58.600> with<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
is this was designed also with the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.720 
is this was designed also with the
amount<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> screamo<00:03:59.800> which<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.610> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
amount of the screamo which is the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.040 
amount of the screamo which is the
philippine<00:04:01.120> arm<00:04:01.270> stick<00:04:01.570> fighting

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
philippine arm stick fighting

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.530 
philippine arm stick fighting
so<00:04:02.320> one-handed<00:04:02.920> usage<00:04:03.100> it's<00:04:03.790> very<00:04:04.030> light<00:04:04.270> it's

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
so one-handed usage it's very light it's

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.660 
so one-handed usage it's very light it's
extreme<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.110> take<00:04:05.320> swords<00:04:05.739> you'll<00:04:06.310> see<00:04:06.520> that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
extreme you take swords you'll see that

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.520 
extreme you take swords you'll see that
you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.090> handle<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.450> sword<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.750> multiple<00:04:08.410> areas

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
you can handle a sword in multiple areas

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.250 
you can handle a sword in multiple areas
it<00:04:08.830> goes<00:04:09.070> extremely<00:04:09.700> well<00:04:09.880> balanced<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:11.050> kept

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
it goes extremely well balanced it kept

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.210 
it goes extremely well balanced it kept
me<00:04:11.320> as<00:04:11.410> light<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.800> feather

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
me as light as a feather

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.880 
me as light as a feather
yet<00:04:12.459> striking<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.180> very<00:04:13.360> quick<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:14.380> rather

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
yet striking can be very quick so rather

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.550 
yet striking can be very quick so rather
than<00:04:15.010> having<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.570> transmit<00:04:16.570> your<00:04:17.290> what<00:04:17.470> you're

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
than having to transmit your what you're

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.020 
than having to transmit your what you're
going<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.739> do<00:04:17.859> with<00:04:17.980> someone<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.790> strike

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
going to do with someone I can strike

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.310 
going to do with someone I can strike
very<00:04:19.180> quick<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.690> come<00:04:19.870> back

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
very quick and come back

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.270 
very quick and come back
I<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.979> thrust<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:22.180> can<00:04:22.690> come<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:22.930> underneath

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
I can thrust I can come up underneath

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.309 
I can thrust I can come up underneath
you<00:04:24.280> do<00:04:24.400> multiple<00:04:24.850> moves

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:26.319 
you do multiple moves

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.779 
you do multiple moves
what<00:04:27.319> I<00:04:27.350> find<00:04:27.650> interesting<00:04:27.949> about<00:04:28.220> this<00:04:28.580> is

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
what I find interesting about this is

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.969 
what I find interesting about this is
remember<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.449> context<00:04:30.199> in<00:04:30.319> terms<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
remember it's context in terms of the

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.590 
remember it's context in terms of the
way<00:04:31.100> in<00:04:31.160> which<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.669> weapon<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.389> would<00:04:32.569> be

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
way in which a weapon like this would be

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.290 
way in which a weapon like this would be
employed<00:04:32.990> we're<00:04:33.860> not<00:04:33.979> talking<00:04:34.340> about<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.639> sword

going to encounter another weapon of its
type<00:04:38.720> we're<00:04:39.380> talking<00:04:39.620> about<00:04:39.710> a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
type we're talking about a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.610

this case we're laminating a serial
plate<00:06:17.810> series<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.500> blades<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.919> make<00:06:19.039> this

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
plate series of blades to make this

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.800

so rather than forging something like
the<00:06:22.849> Japanese<00:06:23.330> did<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:24.009> creating<00:06:25.009> a<00:06:25.039> layer

the Japanese did and creating a layer

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.249 
the Japanese did and creating a layer
upon<00:06:25.460> layer<00:06:25.699> we<00:06:26.240> can<00:06:26.419> actually<00:06:26.539> take<00:06:26.780> multiple

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
upon layer we can actually take multiple
