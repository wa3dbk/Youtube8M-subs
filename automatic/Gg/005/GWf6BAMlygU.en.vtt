them pop is to make sure your recipe has
the<00:00:12.980> correct<00:00:13.219> chemistry<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.240> you<00:00:14.300> layer<00:00:14.690> the

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
the correct chemistry so you layer the

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.590 
the correct chemistry so you layer the
flavors<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:16.340> first<00:00:16.580> layer<00:00:16.820> in<00:00:17.060> our<00:00:17.180> recipe<00:00:17.570> is

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
flavors the first layer in our recipe is

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.480 
flavors the first layer in our recipe is
going<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:18.110> sweetness<00:00:18.800> or<00:00:19.039> our<00:00:19.220> brown

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
going to be a sweetness or our brown

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.849 
going to be a sweetness or our brown
sugar<00:00:19.570> we're<00:00:20.570> then<00:00:20.720> gonna<00:00:20.869> bring<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.350> contrast

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
sugar we're then gonna bring a contrast

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.220 
sugar we're then gonna bring a contrast
into<00:00:22.220> two<00:00:22.369> different<00:00:22.699> flavors<00:00:22.850> of<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.539> orange

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
into two different flavors of a orange

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.460 
into two different flavors of a orange
marmalade<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.039> then<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:26.000> apricot<00:00:26.630> you'll

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
marmalade and then a apricot you'll

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.660 
marmalade and then a apricot you'll
notice<00:00:27.710> all<00:00:27.890> three<00:00:28.100> of<00:00:28.279> these<00:00:28.369> are<00:00:28.550> on<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
notice all three of these are on the

notice all three of these are on the
sweet<00:00:29.029> side<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.930> contrast<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.650> is

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
sweet side so the contrast to this is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.709
