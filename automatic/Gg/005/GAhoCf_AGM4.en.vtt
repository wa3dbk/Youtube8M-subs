00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.839
 good souls 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.300
 I'm going to make a dedication video today. 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 My friend who is doing a job 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
 from college 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 about the sport is a tourism and me 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.090
 chose this video for her 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 explain a little is the life of an oil 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.970
 builder as he interprets as 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 enters the area as well. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 in short is the speaking and a bit of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.690
 My lifestyle is the new line. 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.149
 because it is once you enter it is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 very difficult to leave 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 Good. Come on, I've been practicing bodybuilding since 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.809
 15 years of age and since the age of 15 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.629
 I always liked the practice. 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.840
 bodybuilding and always went to the gym 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.140
 since I was 15 I hardly liked 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 missing and nothing else related like 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 sport one time I went to the gym 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.470
 taking taste is seeing development 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 before training you can be sure that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 everyone who goes to the gym and starts 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.159
 in this evolution takes a certain taste and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 always start to want more always and with 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.740
 more often and beyond one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.580
 research you are accustomed to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.180
 Finally this is the beginning of the gains that have been 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.479
 having in the beginning I went to the morana academy and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.549
 with 17 or 18 years that was where I had 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.150
 greater involvement 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.860
 I decided to search a little bit and beyond 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.360
 I was accustomed 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 so I spent hours on the internet 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 researching about diet on the situation 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.220
 It's all about training things. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.369
 that could differentiate normal 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 So, there we go , it's the practice of 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.909
 urn mouth 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.939
 I started to develop the sheik that is 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.939
 own with championships and decide 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.219
 people is a unique bongi lifestyle 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.909
 bollywood I take you it 's you it's not because 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.319
 its characteristics are as follows the 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.609
 From the moment you beyond 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.750
 you become much more focused on 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:32.480
 independent if it's to do an exercise 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.200
 a task that is in life only 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.019
 focus changes your concentration to others your 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.810
 goals are always keener say 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.709
 so that in addition to what is already 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.569
 used to it 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.010
 You get it today, you talk. 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.959
 damn it hit 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.049
 only attention tomorrow and you will 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.980
 to get more understood is this is not only 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.040
 in academia this becomes a lesson in 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.040
 life 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.629
 the diet of the body builders is not only not 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.489
 worst is not over for those who practice a 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.239
 The situation has to be totally 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.340
 integrated because it is below cuts in 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.060
 a diet aimed at a championship 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.199
 You're not an athlete, shall we say well? 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.049
 visa 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:22.220
 the diet is based more or less a six 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.579
 or seven meals out of supplementation 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.180
 What completes that is we have times 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.870
 which are of zxi zon and kant which are times 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 that you make a muscle gain and another 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.739
 time you make 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.790
 the fat loss that would be consumed 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.340
 Paulo 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.419
 These are the two times when you leave the bathroom. 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.919
 killer that characterize the preparation with 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.109
 the canada the flow of friendship in cars 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:55.340
 of the steer and I can say 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:57.620
 which is totally do not know there the more 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.609
 have not had their means and more 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.449
 people who live understand that people 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:09.470
 Pass it is better for us, we do not want to feel 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:12.949
 its people who do not do this but have 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 many people to see with prejudice or 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.340
 brings no benefit 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.519
 so lets see the eating my chicken 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.830
 with potato when giving oral of the diet 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.010
 start talking that I'm crazy starts 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.360
 talking on the smell of chicken and live up to this 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.150
 It's good when I go in the championship. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.910
 bodybuilding to something more normal than 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.370
 have some egg tomato light moment 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.490
 stuffing and protect and eating chicken 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.220
 on the side this to me and pure is totally 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.880
 normal and enjoyable video being 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.919
 narrou korda by frank think it's little 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.610
 then source of friendship 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.020
 the family is the woman you choose 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.690
 to your side 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.680
 are people who really have to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.530
 understand and really understand do not think 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.000
 who understands that wheat understands this 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:10.860
 which is day after day is infection 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.820
 meal is a day at last 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.270
 normal after a while you 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.599
 ends up becoming accustomed and becomes a 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.860
 pleasure to do this 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.560
 let us say that also the little individuals 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.250
 car because to eat well 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.349
 balanced is not easy to succeed 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.210
 money in the market because it is only 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:38.729
 good property, let's just say my 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.639
 idols within the sport 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.000
 are all those who live in bollywood 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.610
 and has already been champion because to become 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.669
 a champion in the sport can be sure 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.949
 sure it's not anyone you guy 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.460
 have to let go without eating 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.699
 bullshit while doing things 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.680
 everything to go on stage all to one 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.729
 day is only on 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.970
 it's not part of going out a couple of times if there 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.970
 that low runaway for the champion 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:17.130
 you can be absolutely sure that he did 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.570
 everything 100% otherwise unfortunately is very 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.780
 hard to win 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.480
 then this is a more or less summary of the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.710
 bole life peter 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:31.700
 It is this controversial sport that is 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.890
 seen in brazil but i hope with the 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.780
 time everything changes as it is 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.610
 changing because a lot of people were 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.210
 entering there in this sport 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.400
 taking a fright and increasingly I am

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 we strive for this to become increasingly 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:52.640
 more normal is more and more the 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.890
