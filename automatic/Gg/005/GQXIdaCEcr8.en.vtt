had adds enough platform to hold it up
in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.260> put<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.830> decent<00:00:35.129> amount<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
in the back we put a decent amount of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.100 
in the back we put a decent amount of
bar<00:00:35.820> into<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.150> front<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.629> can<00:00:36.809> keep<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
bar into the front so you can keep a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
bar into the front so you can keep a
real<00:00:37.260> soft<00:00:37.590> mainspring<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
car deep up into the corner it just has

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.850 
car deep up into the corner it just has
some<00:00:41.550> lovely<00:00:41.909> characteristics<00:00:42.870> topped<00:00:43.589> off

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
some lovely characteristics topped off

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.009 
some lovely characteristics topped off
with<00:00:43.890> our<00:00:44.659> TPC<00:00:45.659> tune<00:00:46.110> jrz<00:00:46.979> suspension<00:00:48.019> which

with our TPC tune jrz suspension which

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.680 
with our TPC tune jrz suspension which
this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> brand<00:00:50.580> new<00:00:50.850> system<00:00:51.089> this<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.659> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this is a brand new system this is the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
this is a brand new system this is the
new<00:00:52.409> S<00:00:52.769> wood<00:00:54.440> damper<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.400> single<00:00:56.940> way

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
new S wood damper this is a single way

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.320 
new S wood damper this is a single way
damper<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.430> same<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.909> remote

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
damper but it is the same as a remote

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.149 
damper but it is the same as a remote
reservoir<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.920> gas

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
reservoir because it's got the gas

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.939 
reservoir because it's got the gas
charge<00:01:02.610> area<00:01:03.180> inside<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.839> actual<00:01:04.409> piston

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
charge area inside the actual piston

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.580 
charge area inside the actual piston
body<00:01:05.190> itself<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> shock<00:01:06.900> body<00:01:07.229> there's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
body itself so in the shock body there's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
body itself so in the shock body there's
another<00:01:07.979> body<00:01:08.430> internally<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.450> there's<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
another body internally and there's a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.870 
another body internally and there's a
divider<00:01:10.440> piston<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> divider

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
divider piston and then that divider

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.150 
divider piston and then that divider
piston<00:01:12.390> divides<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.960> nitrogen<00:01:13.560> charge<00:01:13.860> from

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
piston divides the nitrogen charge from

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.360 
piston divides the nitrogen charge from
the<00:01:14.280> oil<00:01:14.430> charge<00:01:15.230> so<00:01:16.230> this<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.770> effect<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:19.370> is

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
the oil charge so this in effect is a is

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.100 
the oil charge so this in effect is a is
a<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.690> single<00:01:22.560> damper<00:01:23.480> mono<00:01:24.480> tube<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
a just a single damper mono tube it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.550 
a just a single damper mono tube it's
called<00:01:26.330> design<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.660> it's<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> race

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
called design so it's just like the race

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.940 
called design so it's just like the race
shock<00:01:29.420> packaged<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.690> an<00:01:30.870> easy<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> assemble

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
shock packaged in an easy to assemble

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730 
shock packaged in an easy to assemble
the<00:01:32.670> street<00:01:33.090> package<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.020> would<00:01:34.260> also<00:01:34.440> work

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the street package this would also work

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
the street package this would also work
great<00:01:34.800> for<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> race<00:01:35.460> car<00:01:35.700> we've<00:01:35.910> run<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
great for the race car we've run the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
great for the race car we've run the
singles<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.720> racing<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.260> let's<00:01:38.190> take<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.550> out

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
singles in racing but let's take it out

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
singles in racing but let's take it out
and<00:01:38.790> drive<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.120> around<00:01:39.210> let's<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and drive it around let's see how this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.930 
and drive it around let's see how this
car<00:01:40.380> drives<00:01:40.620> it's<00:01:40.830> got<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.980> really<00:01:41.250> soft<00:01:41.610> spring

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
car drives it's got a really soft spring

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.180 
car drives it's got a really soft spring
package<00:01:42.330> there<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.290> great<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.920> great

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.800 

I<00:01:51.060> love<00:01:51.690> these<00:01:51.870> Peter<00:01:52.110> Kay's<00:01:52.410> they're<00:01:53.160> great

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
I love these Peter Kay's they're great

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.020 
I love these Peter Kay's they're great
sweet

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.710 

the<00:01:58.030> scene<00:01:58.270> always<00:01:58.480> been<00:01:58.750> right<00:01:58.960> here

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.350 

what<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> reason<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.730> jrc

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
what really is the reason that the jrc

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.889 
what really is the reason that the jrc
really<00:02:06.720> works<00:02:06.990> well<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.330> piston<00:02:09.750> rod

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
really works well is that the piston rod

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.650 
really works well is that the piston rod
is<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.410> large<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.670> displaces<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.330> lot<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
is very large and it displaces a lot of

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.660 
is very large and it displaces a lot of
oil<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.350> consequently<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.160> happens<00:02:14.220> with

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
oil so consequently what happens with

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.090 
oil so consequently what happens with
that<00:02:14.850> much<00:02:15.000> displacement<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.470> piston<00:02:16.920> rod

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
that much displacement of the piston rod

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700 
that much displacement of the piston rod
the<00:02:17.790> piston<00:02:18.270> when<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.570> has<00:02:18.720> any<00:02:19.080> movement

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the piston when it has any movement

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.980 
the piston when it has any movement
whatsoever<00:02:20.030> displaces<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.420> oil<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
whatsoever displaces a lot of oil so the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.530 
whatsoever displaces a lot of oil so the
valve<00:02:22.260> action<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> very<00:02:23.160> quick<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.270> quick

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
valve action is very quick so it's quick

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.990 
valve action is very quick so it's quick
to<00:02:24.570> react<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.740> can<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> damper<00:02:26.760> very

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
to react so you can make the damper very

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.630 
to react so you can make the damper very
soft<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.080> controls<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.100> chassis

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
soft but it really controls the chassis

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.060 
soft but it really controls the chassis
and<00:02:29.820> when<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> have<00:02:30.780> cheaper<00:02:31.410> dampers<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
and when you have cheaper dampers and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.650 
and when you have cheaper dampers and
they<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.250> small<00:02:32.550> piston<00:02:32.970> rods<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.390> takes<00:02:33.570> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
they have small piston rods it takes a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.060 
they have small piston rods it takes a
lot<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.870> movement<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.470> start<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> move<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
lot of movement to start to move the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.550 
lot of movement to start to move the
shim<00:02:35.430> stock<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.080> happens

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
shim stock that's actually what happens

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.040 
shim stock that's actually what happens
so<00:02:37.830> that's<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.970> normal<00:02:39.120> characteristic

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
so that's just a normal characteristic

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.080 
so that's just a normal characteristic
of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> jrz<00:02:40.800> shock<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:41.790> said

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
of the jrz shock it really has said

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.700 
of the jrz shock it really has said
they've<00:02:42.360> they've<00:02:42.570> been

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
they've they've been

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.770 
they've they've been
you<00:02:44.770> know<00:02:44.890> amazing<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.670> using<00:02:45.970> large<00:02:46.210> mr.<00:02:46.600> rod

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you know amazing and using large mr. rod

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.960 
you know amazing and using large mr. rod
for<00:02:47.050> years<00:02:47.260> that's<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:48.430> reason<00:02:48.640> we've<00:02:48.940> been

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
I got to tell you we one of the reasons

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.080 
I got to tell you we one of the reasons
we<00:03:05.710> had<00:03:05.830> such<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.070> great<00:03:06.340> part<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.790> last

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
we had such a great part of this last

we had such a great part of this last
race<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.560> last<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.980> LMS<00:03:09.340> weekend<00:03:09.700> which<00:03:09.880> was

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
race the last a LMS weekend which was

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.030 
race the last a LMS weekend which was
Lime<00:03:10.300> Rock<00:03:10.330> last<00:03:10.900> weekend<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.590> think<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.890> what

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
Lime Rock last weekend I think that what

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.410 
Lime Rock last weekend I think that what
is<00:03:12.130> earth<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.430> had<00:03:12.580> before

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
is earth we had before

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.330 
is earth we had before
we<00:03:13.870> had<00:03:14.020> an<00:03:14.140> incredible<00:03:14.710> car<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
we had an incredible car one of the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.510 
we had an incredible car one of the
reasons<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.300> we<00:03:16.690> not<00:03:16.870> only<00:03:16.930> found<00:03:17.620> what

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
reasons was that we not only found what

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.520 
reasons was that we not only found what
it<00:03:18.640> took<00:03:18.790> in<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.090> chassis<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> uphill

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it took in the chassis but in the uphill

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.220 
it took in the chassis but in the uphill
hairpin<00:03:21.070> section<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.180> real<00:03:22.390> bumpy<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.900> go

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
hairpin section it was real bumpy you go

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.780 
hairpin section it was real bumpy you go
over<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.470> lot<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.740> transition<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.490> could<00:03:24.640> just

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
over a lot of transition we could just

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.820 
over a lot of transition we could just
go<00:03:24.940> flat<00:03:25.270> as<00:03:25.480> soon<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:25.990> turned<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.380> car<00:03:26.620> in

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
go flat as soon as we turned the car in

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.310 
go flat as soon as we turned the car in
just<00:03:27.280> stay<00:03:27.520> flat<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> gas<00:03:28.720> all<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.140> way<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
just stay flat on the gas all the way to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.180 
just stay flat on the gas all the way to
last<00:03:29.590> Bend

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
last Bend

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.520 
last Bend
it<00:03:30.850> was<00:03:31.000> amazing<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.690> thing<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.080> sucked<00:03:32.320> up

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it was amazing the thing just sucked up

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.830 
it was amazing the thing just sucked up
the<00:03:32.560> bumps<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.160> doesn't<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:34.270> was<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.420> night<00:03:34.660> we

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
the bumps it doesn't it was a night we

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.360 
the bumps it doesn't it was a night we
would<00:03:34.960> just<00:03:35.200> close<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.920> car<00:03:36.130> that's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
would just close in on the car that's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.920 
would just close in on the car that's
where<00:03:36.550> we<00:03:36.670> made<00:03:36.820> up<00:03:36.970> all<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.240> lap<00:03:37.360> time<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.810> was

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
where we made up all the lap time it was

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.990 
where we made up all the lap time it was
amazing<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.680> mean<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.160> definitely<00:03:39.640> didn't<00:03:39.850> make

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
amazing I mean I definitely didn't make

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.550 
amazing I mean I definitely didn't make
the<00:03:40.150> pass<00:03:40.300> we<00:03:40.540> actually<00:03:40.900> start<00:03:41.140> pushing<00:03:41.470> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
the pass we actually start pushing the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.380 
the pass we actually start pushing the
cart<00:03:41.800> again<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.700> we<00:03:42.820> had<00:03:42.970> such<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> hard

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
cart again because we had such a hard

cart again because we had such a hard
run

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
run

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.399

difference it's a reason the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
manufacturers build it like this look at

nice<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.930> actually<00:05:04.470> with<00:05:04.650> this<00:05:05.060> with<00:05:06.060> the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
nice so actually with this with the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.060 
nice so actually with this with the
piston<00:05:06.570> rod<00:05:06.750> being<00:05:06.990> so<00:05:07.260> large<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.770> back<00:05:07.920> of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
piston rod being so large in the back of

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.410 
piston rod being so large in the back of
the<00:05:08.160> corner

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
the corner

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.200 
the corner
with<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.930> actual

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
with the actual

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.830 
with the actual
flex<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.199> rubber<00:05:13.410> bushing<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.910> rate

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
flex of the rubber bushing and it rate

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.779 
flex of the rubber bushing and it rate
the<00:05:16.080> type<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.350> bushing<00:05:16.860> it's<00:05:17.039> a<00:05:17.160> it's<00:05:17.639> a

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
the type of bushing it's a it's a

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.300 
the type of bushing it's a it's a
stencil<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.509> thermometer<00:05:18.900> scale<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:20.310> so

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
stencil a thermometer scale and so

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.390 
stencil a thermometer scale and so
we<00:05:22.820> can<00:05:23.120> literally<00:05:23.720> with<00:05:23.900> just<00:05:24.139> every<00:05:24.950> slight

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
we can literally with just every slight

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.190 
we can literally with just every slight
bit<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.790> movement<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.270> piston<00:05:26.660> rod<00:05:26.780> we<00:05:27.050> can

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
bit of movement the piston rod we can

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.629 
bit of movement the piston rod we can
change<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.710> amount<00:05:27.920> of<00:05:27.980> oil<00:05:28.190> flow<00:05:28.460> that's

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
change the amount of oil flow that's

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.000 
change the amount of oil flow that's
going<00:05:28.940> by<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.150> piston<00:05:29.720> so<00:05:30.139> we're<00:05:30.860> really

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
going by the piston so we're really

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.950 
going by the piston so we're really
getting<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.430> lot<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.610> displacement<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.450> lot<00:05:32.870> of

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
getting a lot of displacement a lot of

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.840 
getting a lot of displacement a lot of
times<00:05:33.169> like<00:05:33.380> when<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.620> see<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.919> on<00:05:34.070> a<00:05:34.100> on<00:05:34.790> a

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850
