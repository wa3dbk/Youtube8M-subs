00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
WordPress is that you have this little

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.730 
WordPress is that you have this little
bar<00:05:39.000> at<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.240> top<00:05:39.480> but<00:05:39.960> that's<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.410> only

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
bar at the top but that's the only

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.629 
bar at the top but that's the only
