right now but I couldn't test it out

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.069 
right now but I couldn't test it out
because<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> game<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.240> released<00:01:39.630> yet<00:01:39.780> and

I couldn't find a match but if it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
I couldn't find a match but if it's
anything<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.530> console<00:01:44.009> version<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
anything like a console version it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.530 
anything like a console version it
should<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.210> pretty<00:01:45.540> pretty<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.880> only

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
should be pretty pretty good the only

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.350 
should be pretty pretty good the only
thing<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.729> fault<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.909> game<00:01:51.119> for

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
thing that I can fault in this game for

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.380 
thing that I can fault in this game for
is<00:01:51.600> number<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:53.040> part<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> console

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
is number one it's a part of the console

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
is number one it's a part of the console
version<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.140> doesn't<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.740> add<00:01:56.100> much

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
version and it doesn't really add much

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.389 
version and it doesn't really add much
to<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> few<00:01:58.619> extra<00:01:58.770> chapters

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to the game there's a few extra chapters

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.149 
to the game there's a few extra chapters
here<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.009> if

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
here and there but that's about it so if

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.060 
here and there but that's about it so if
you<00:02:02.340> already<00:02:02.520> own<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.210> console<00:02:03.930> version

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
you already own the console version

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
you already own the console version
there's<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.549> incentive<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.719> pick<00:02:06.960> up

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there's not much incentive to pick up

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
there's not much incentive to pick up
the<00:02:07.380> portable<00:02:07.829> version<00:02:08.129> unless<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.640> super
