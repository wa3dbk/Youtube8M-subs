00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030 
potassium-argon dating because here's
the<00:01:47.189> theory<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> volcano<00:01:48.270> erupts<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the theory when a volcano erupts the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.039 
the theory when a volcano erupts the
rocks<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> stuff<00:01:50.880> coming<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.720> hot

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
rocks and stuff coming out is really hot

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
rocks and stuff coming out is really hot
and<00:01:52.290> any<00:01:52.439> gases<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> should<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.549> able<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and any gases in it should be able to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.469 
and any gases in it should be able to
escape<00:01:54.439> well<00:01:55.439> potassium<00:01:56.100> slowly<00:01:56.820> turns<00:01:57.240> into

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
escape well potassium slowly turns into

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
escape well potassium slowly turns into
argon<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.469> argon<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> gas<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> for

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
argon and argon is a gas that use it for

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
argon and argon is a gas that use it for
welding<00:02:00.299> over<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> shop<00:02:00.840> argon<00:02:01.469> welding

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
welding over at the shop argon welding

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.730 
welding over at the shop argon welding
you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.360> Argon's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> gas<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.530> since

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you know Argon's a gas so since

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
you know Argon's a gas so since
potassium<00:02:05.310> turns<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.700> argon<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> rock

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
potassium turns to argon when the rock

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
potassium turns to argon when the rock
gets<00:02:07.380> melted<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.069> shot<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.700> volcano

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
gets melted and shot out of a volcano

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.750 
gets melted and shot out of a volcano
all<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.720> gas<00:02:09.899> escapes<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> theory

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
all the gas escapes and so the theory

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.730 
all the gas escapes and so the theory
says<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.540> new<00:02:12.780> layer

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
says this new layer

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.970 
says this new layer
have<00:02:13.890> bent<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.130> clock<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.970> now<00:02:15.180> reset<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.680> 0

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
have bent the clock is now reset it is 0

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.030 
have bent the clock is now reset it is 0

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
old now all the GAR are gone is gone

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
old now all the GAR are gone is gone
because<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> accumulated<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.610> argon<00:02:23.880> for

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
because it accumulated this argon for

because it accumulated this argon for
millions<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> years<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.020> poof<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.500> melted

millions of years but now poof it melted

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
and the gas is gone so we can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.380 
and the gas is gone so we can

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
said wow how can you have a normal human

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.950 
said wow how can you have a normal human

three<00:03:08.820> million<00:03:09.000> years<00:03:09.330> ago<00:03:10.280> that's<00:03:11.280> not

three million years ago that's not

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.690 
three million years ago that's not
possible<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.130> looked<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.520> things

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
200 million year old rock so what do you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.620 
200 million year old rock so what do you
conclude<00:03:28.730> well<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:29.880> group<00:03:30.060> study<00:03:30.300> distance

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
conclude well one group study distance

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.060 
conclude well one group study distance

200 million years ago would you would
you<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.180> consider<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.630> maybe<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.110> rocks

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you just consider that maybe the rocks

okay<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.620> drop<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.950> number<00:04:08.190> way<00:04:08.490> down<00:04:08.959> but

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
okay they drop the number way down but

the moon

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.640
