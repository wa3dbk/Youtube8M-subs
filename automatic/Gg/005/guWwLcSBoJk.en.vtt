the the loop when when I dropped the

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.550 
the the loop when when I dropped the
needle<00:03:01.820> down<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.420> needle<00:03:02.600> will<00:03:02.840> drop<00:03:03.050> down<00:03:03.290> oh

I'm going to fail look the hooks coming
coming<00:03:06.530> around<00:03:06.970> hooks<00:03:07.970> coming<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.420> get<00:03:08.540> it

basket<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.750> needle<00:03:12.140> drops<00:03:12.500> down

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
basket in there the needle drops down

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.030 
basket in there the needle drops down
there's<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.910> needle<00:03:14.180> here<00:03:15.170> comes<00:03:15.380> way<00:03:15.650> up<00:03:15.830> there

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
there's a needle here comes way up there

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.840 
there's a needle here comes way up there
and<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.940> needle<00:03:17.299> drops<00:03:17.570> down<00:03:18.250> let's<00:03:19.250> zoom<00:03:19.670> in

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
and the needle drops down let's zoom in

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.199 
and the needle drops down let's zoom in
there

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
there

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.400 
there
oh<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:22.340> his<00:03:22.549> max<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:23.000> second<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.570> come<00:03:23.870> on

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
oh that's his max a second to come on

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.280 
oh that's his max a second to come on
let's<00:03:24.709> bring<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:26.680> Machine<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.830> closer<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
let's bring the Machine up closer so the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.699 
let's bring the Machine up closer so the
needle<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.709> dropping<00:03:31.160> down<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.610> there<00:03:31.880> and

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
needle was dropping down in there and

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.280 
needle was dropping down in there and
the<00:03:33.709> hook<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.910> actually<00:03:35.269> going<00:03:35.510> up<00:03:35.840> before

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the hook it was actually going up before

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.789 
the hook it was actually going up before
the<00:03:36.709> hook<00:03:36.920> past<00:03:37.310> behind<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.390> picked<00:03:39.290> up<00:03:39.530> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
the hook past behind and picked up the

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.570 
the hook past behind and picked up the
the<00:03:40.130> loop<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.390> my<00:03:42.019> timing<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.620> my<00:03:42.830> hook<00:03:43.100> was<00:03:43.310> off

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
the loop so my timing on my hook was off

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.620 
the loop so my timing on my hook was off
and<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:46.040> think<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.430> did<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.820> because<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.360> pulled

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
and I think I did that because I pulled

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.530 
and I think I did that because I pulled
down<00:03:47.930> some<00:03:48.290> loose<00:03:48.950> thread<00:03:49.340> or<00:03:49.580> some<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
down some loose thread or some the the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.140 
down some loose thread or some the the
tension<00:03:51.530> was<00:03:51.830> bad<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.400> was<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:53.060> know

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
tension was bad and I was like you know

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.720 
tension was bad and I was like you know
get<00:03:53.840> out<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.080> there<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.440> forced<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.580> too

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
get out of there and I forced it too

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.100 
get out of there and I forced it too
much<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.769> so<00:03:57.769> I<00:03:57.799> in<00:03:58.519> trying<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.209> repair<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.780> I

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
much and so I in trying to repair that I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.449 
much and so I in trying to repair that I
was<00:04:00.260> like<00:04:00.380> well<00:04:00.560> why<00:04:00.799> isn't<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.250> hook

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
was like well why isn't the hook

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.069 
was like well why isn't the hook
catching<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.269> too<00:04:02.420> far<00:04:02.630> back<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.019> I

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
catching it is it too far back and I

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.420 
catching it is it too far back and I
started<00:04:03.410> pushing<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:04.299> this<00:04:05.410> this<00:04:06.410> piece<00:04:07.040> here

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
started pushing on this this piece here

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.970 
started pushing on this this piece here
the<00:04:07.610> needle<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.720> don't<00:04:08.959> know<00:04:09.200> what<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.560> this

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the needle I I don't know what this this

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.780 
the needle I I don't know what this this
needle<00:04:10.970> bar<00:04:11.239> or<00:04:11.510> something<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:13.310> vertical

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
needle bar or something this vertical

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.390 
needle bar or something this vertical
thing<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.209> comes<00:04:14.450> down<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.870> pushed<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.380> and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
thing that comes down I pushed it and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.949 
thing that comes down I pushed it and
what<00:04:16.790> happened<00:04:17.269> was<00:04:17.509> I<00:04:17.810> think<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:19.959> misaligned

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
what happened was I think I misaligned

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.890 
what happened was I think I misaligned
it<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.220> when<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.580> read<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.360> at<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.660> time

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
it and so when I read just at the time

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.210 
it and so when I read just at the time
and<00:04:24.139> actually<00:04:24.470> broke<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.740> needle<00:04:26.050> because<00:04:27.220> what

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
and actually broke a needle because what

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.879 
and actually broke a needle because what
would<00:04:28.340> happen<00:04:28.759> was<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.600> needle<00:04:30.169> was<00:04:30.320> too

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
would happen was that the needle was too

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.180 
would happen was that the needle was too
far<00:04:31.430> back<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.690> when<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.110> hook<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:34.039> would

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
far back and when the hook it would

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.060 
far back and when the hook it would
actually<00:04:34.370> hit<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.389> side<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.990> needle<00:04:36.199> and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
actually hit the side of the needle and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.590 
actually hit the side of the needle and
I<00:04:37.400> was<00:04:37.490> like<00:04:37.610> well<00:04:37.759> that<00:04:37.789> isn't<00:04:38.240> good<00:04:38.389> I<00:04:38.419> just

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
I was like well that isn't good I just

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.909 
I was like well that isn't good I just
broke<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.050> needle<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:42.160> what<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.190> did<00:04:43.370> after<00:04:43.850> that

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
broke a needle so what I did after that

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.590 
broke a needle so what I did after that
was<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.639> don't<00:04:46.699> know<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.300> do<00:04:47.419> this

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
was and I don't know if you can do this

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.420 
was and I don't know if you can do this
on<00:04:47.720> your<00:04:47.750> machine<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.100> the

on your machine and you know and the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.950 
on your machine and you know and the
reason<00:04:49.760> I'm<00:04:49.880> doing<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.510> because<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:51.320> did

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
reason I'm doing this is because I did

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.330 
reason I'm doing this is because I did
finish<00:04:53.960> University<00:04:54.680> with<00:04:54.800> an<00:04:54.919> engineering

and so that it kind of and the needle

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.370 
and so that it kind of and the needle
went<00:05:22.820> forward<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:23.479> you<00:05:23.840> understand<00:05:24.199> what<00:05:24.289> I'm

saying so I realigned the needle it was
kind<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.849> like<00:05:29.090> at<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.300> angle<00:05:30.310> getting<00:05:31.310> hit<00:05:31.550> by

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
kind of like at a angle getting hit by

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.670 
kind of like at a angle getting hit by
the<00:05:31.820> hook<00:05:32.180> but<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:32.990> pushed<00:05:33.320> it<00:05:33.500> out<00:05:33.620> a

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
the hook but I just pushed it out a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.980 
the hook but I just pushed it out a
little<00:05:33.919> bit<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.340> then<00:05:34.610> now<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:35.240> seems<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.870> be

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
little bit and then now it seems to be

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.939 
little bit and then now it seems to be
working<00:05:36.349> fine<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:37.639> I'm<00:05:38.300> happy<00:05:39.260> about<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.860> uh
