startup<00:02:01.710> sequence<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.969> honest<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
startup sequence to be honest with you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
startup sequence to be honest with you
it<00:02:03.630> looks<00:02:03.810> fine<00:02:04.079> there's<00:02:04.439> no<00:02:04.590> issues<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.130> all

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
it looks fine there's no issues at all

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
it looks fine there's no issues at all
and<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.600> relatively<00:02:07.020> quick

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and as you can see it's relatively quick

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.270 
and as you can see it's relatively quick
this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.310> fast<00:02:09.119> print<00:02:09.569> mode<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:11.069> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
this is on fast print mode so this is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.130 
this is on fast print mode so this is
the<00:02:11.459> quickest<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.180> print<00:02:12.390> app<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the quickest it can print app and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.500 
the quickest it can print app and
the<00:02:14.650> higher<00:02:14.890> resolution<00:02:15.130> Mo's<00:02:15.670> will<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.300> much

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the higher resolution Mo's will be much

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780 
the higher resolution Mo's will be much
more<00:02:16.810> intense<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:18.070> we'll<00:02:18.220> take<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.490> bit<00:02:18.760> longer

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
more intense but we'll take a bit longer

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.240 
more intense but we'll take a bit longer
but<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.450> think<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.080> absolutely<00:02:20.770> fine<00:02:21.070> it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
but I think that is absolutely fine it

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.070 
but I think that is absolutely fine it
is<00:02:21.340> more<00:02:21.610> than<00:02:21.730> adequate<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.300> printing<00:02:22.930> on

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
is more than adequate for printing on

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.520 
is more than adequate for printing on
the<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:25.090> let's<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.930> turn<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the go right let's just now turn the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
the go right let's just now turn the
Machine<00:02:26.830> off<00:02:28.110> power<00:02:29.110> button<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.630> it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
Machine off power button here and it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.170 
Machine off power button here and it
folds<00:02:31.870> away<00:02:32.110> nice<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.800> neat<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:33.880> so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
folds away nice and neat like so so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.850 
folds away nice and neat like so so
let's<00:02:34.390> unplug<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.140> from<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> PC<00:02:36.550> okay<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.140> as

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
let's unplug it from the PC okay so as

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
let's unplug it from the PC okay so as
you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:39.730> has<00:02:40.000> got<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.480> battery

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930

without<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.360> battery<00:02:43.630> pack<00:02:43.990> you'll<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.800> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
without the battery pack you'll have to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.790 
without the battery pack you'll have to
run<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.370> from<00:02:45.550> either<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.840> AC<00:02:46.990> adapter<00:02:47.680> which

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
run it from either the AC adapter which

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.710 
run it from either the AC adapter which
you<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:48.070> also<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.150> version<00:02:49.630> with

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
you do also get with the version with

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.170 
you do also get with the version with
the<00:02:49.750> battery<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.490> buy<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.670> optional

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the battery or you can buy the optional

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.840 
the battery or you can buy the optional
car<00:02:52.450> adapter<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:53.590> if<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.280> were<00:02:54.370> going<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.610> run

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
car adapter but if you were going to run

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.500 
car adapter but if you were going to run
with<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.990> battery<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:58.120> need<00:02:58.330> to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
with the battery then you need to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.360 
with the battery then you need to
install<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> first<00:02:59.140> now<00:02:59.800> I'm<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.280> to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.920 
install it first now I'm just going to
do<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.640> reverse<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.300> obviously<00:03:01.600> it's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
do it in reverse because obviously it's

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.310 
do it in reverse because obviously it's
already<00:03:02.170> connected<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.900> some<00:03:05.050> screws

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
already connected so just some screws

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:15.900 
already connected so just some screws
here<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:08.260> comes<00:03:08.470> off<00:03:08.740> very<00:03:08.980> easily<00:03:14.910> and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
here and it comes off very easily and

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.140 
here and it comes off very easily and
I'll<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:16.770> make<00:03:17.770> sure<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.310> unscrew<00:03:19.000> its

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
I'll just make sure that we unscrew its

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:30.740 
I'll just make sure that we unscrew its
toy<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.330> go<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.100> battery<00:03:30.550> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
toy there we go and the battery is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.890 
toy there we go and the battery is
inside<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.170> bathroom<00:03:32.830> unclick<00:03:33.900> alright

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
inside and the bathroom unclick alright

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.380 
inside and the bathroom unclick alright
so<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.290> there's<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> battery<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:37.209> is

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
so so there's the battery and this is

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.060 
so so there's the battery and this is
just<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.690> cover<00:03:37.900> makes<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.650> little<00:03:38.769> bit

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
just a cover makes it a little bit

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.530 
just a cover makes it a little bit
bigger<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.430> don't<00:03:42.640> have<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> battery

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
bigger but if you don't have the battery

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.390 
bigger but if you don't have the battery
just<00:03:43.750> cover<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.200> little<00:03:44.470> flat<00:03:44.830> there<00:03:44.860> and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
just cover that little flat there and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.030 
just cover that little flat there and
that's<00:03:46.360> how<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.570> machine<00:03:46.959> looks<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.800> you've
