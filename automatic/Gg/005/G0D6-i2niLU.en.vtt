00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.290
 new bar mixer 940 cc already in action 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 I would like to show you today 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 the technical features great details 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.500
 and the scope of delivery 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.779
 The brown stick mixer is a real one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.800
 multi-talented he can effortlessly puree 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 chop and mix 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 thanks to its long-lasting lithium ions 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 batteries of a low self-discharge 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 the wand mixer is guaranteed too 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.720
 wireless and thus very flexible 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 used 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 after three months there is no loading 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.450
 case is noticeable 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.760
 In addition, the battery is also ultra-fast 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 charged 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 a fast charge took 15 minutes 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.360
 a full charge for two hours 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280
 the charging station is at the same time to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 Charging and Storage is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 Here I have them again 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.680
 you can bring it here completely 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 Just hang up and he will lie down 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.050
 easy on the scope of delivery is beside 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 the state mixa still 1.25 liters 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.070
 stand mixer on this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 this one is a real 3 in 1 talent 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 in addition to its blender property can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 these also still crush and before 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.979
 all ice scratching the next could 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 So party can come to the stand mixer 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.680
 you have to use marc tower on it 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:31.110
 Just put the motor from the stick mixer here 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.579
 take off and put on top of it and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 then you just use it as well 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.270
 the normal for her too 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.189
 cleaning is simply the knife 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.549
 manages to see it removable again 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.890
 and even dishwasher safe thanks 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.659
 they stay with a special technology 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.659
 sound better over years of hot 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.960
 powermat that's what you call the combination 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.150
 Hard stainless steel sounds and the bells 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.100
 form of mixers here you can them to you 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.570
 let's see 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.630
 These guarantee a perfect pury 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.770
 result already in the application 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.770
 could recognize video 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.070
 you can the wandmixer quite comfortable 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.070
 operate with one hand 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 I have already shown those to her 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.780
 you have to first click the unlock button 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.330
 press while just 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740
 the switch and then a second 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.750
 Can you get the developmental key 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060
 let go and you can do it with me 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.140
 hand operation 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.810
 Of course there is also a small drawback 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.870
 because the wand mixer is wireless and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.000
 So having a battery is something 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.770
 heavier than mixa with cable 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 Nevertheless, he is relatively well in 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.430
 the hand 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.250
 Overall, one can say that to me 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.600
 I really like it very much 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.519
 only recommend it 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.890
 In addition to his great design I find the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.850
 noble with the black and with the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.160
 Stainless steel is very mixa too 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.870
 extremely powerful and strong and 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.190
 creates results within a few 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.920
 seconds as synonymous with a 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.660
 you have seen application video 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.000
 puree everything and chop it all up 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.709
 especially with fruits and other things 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.350
 it is relatively fast but also at 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.190
 hard stuff like ice is the stand mixer 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.290
 tower perfectly suitable and you have 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.290
 small chopped ice for cocktails
