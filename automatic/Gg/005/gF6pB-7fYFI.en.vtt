storm drain Speedway and the car I use

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.240 
storm drain Speedway and the car I use
is<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.519> elite<00:00:23.850> GT<00:00:24.480> 12<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> car

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that I suggest you to use as well it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
that I suggest you to use as well it
just<00:00:30.029> seems<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> fastest<00:00:31.560> car<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
just seems to be the fastest car and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
just seems to be the fastest car and
stuff<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.329> does<00:00:33.510> drift<00:00:33.809> pretty

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
stuff like that but it does drift pretty

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.740 
stuff like that but it does drift pretty
easily<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:35.489> take<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> bad

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
easily but take the good with the bad

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
easily but take the good with the bad
and<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:38.520> should<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.570> favor

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and it should all work out in your favor

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
and it should all work out in your favor
so<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> point<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> convoy<00:00:43.920> achievement

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
so the point of the convoy achievement

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.720 
so the point of the convoy achievement
is<00:00:44.640> passing<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.180> 12<00:00:45.570> big<00:00:46.320> rigs<00:00:46.730> without

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
is passing them 12 big rigs without

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
is passing them 12 big rigs without
crashing<00:00:48.420> dying<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:50.210> wrecking<00:00:51.440> whatever<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
crashing dying or wrecking whatever you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.020 
crashing dying or wrecking whatever you
want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> call<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
want to call it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
want to call it
so<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.140> ones<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.739> pretty<00:00:55.920> easy

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so the first ones get are pretty easy

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
so the first ones get are pretty easy
anytime<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> bridge<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.949> stick<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> the

the left pass it when just blues to the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.880 
the left pass it when just blues to the
right-hand<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:29.990> pass<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> big<00:01:31.439> rig<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
right-hand side pass up the big rig and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
right-hand side pass up the big rig and
move<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> left-hand<00:01:32.729> side<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> track

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
move to the left-hand side of the track

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
move to the left-hand side of the track
again<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.790> back<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> right

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
again here have to go back to the right

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
again here have to go back to the right
because<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> big<00:01:36.750> rig<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.189> left<00:01:38.400> hand

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
because the big rig is on the left hand

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.789 
because the big rig is on the left hand
side<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.900> that's<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> big<00:01:40.229> rig<00:01:40.380> move<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.710> the

side so that's the big rig move to the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
side so that's the big rig move to the
left<00:01:41.299> see<00:01:42.299> when<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> drops<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> blue<00:01:42.960> girls

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
left see when it drops the blue girls

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.690 
left see when it drops the blue girls
already<00:01:43.799> moved<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> right-hand<00:01:44.640> side

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
already moved to the right-hand side

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
already moved to the right-hand side
between<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.540> blue<00:01:45.810> barrels<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> dodge

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
between the blue barrels and you dodge

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.170 
between the blue barrels and you dodge
the<00:01:47.310> red<00:01:47.430> ones<00:01:47.610> every<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:48.000> fooling<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> AI

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.999 

it<00:01:54.180> works<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.930> track<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> all

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it works out because this track is all

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:56.780 
it works out because this track is all
left-hand<00:01:56.369> turns

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
left-hand turns

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
left-hand turns
so<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.850> hey<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.719> never<00:02:00.899> seem<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> get

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so the hey I just can never seem to get

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
so the hey I just can never seem to get
you<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.979> always<00:02:02.130> thinks<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> left

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you it always thinks you're on the left
