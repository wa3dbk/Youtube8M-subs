ounces so the length of the cord so it

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.100 
ounces so the length of the cord so it
is<00:05:18.990> 115<00:05:19.770> Sun<00:05:20.669> muted<00:05:20.910> 245<00:05:21.419> inches<00:05:21.600> let<00:05:21.900> me<00:05:21.960> just

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
is 115 Sun muted 245 inches let me just

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.909 
is 115 Sun muted 245 inches let me just
show<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:22.290> how<00:05:22.470> long<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.979> is<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:23.970> pretty<00:05:24.360> long

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
so size the width is actually five

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.400 
so size the width is actually five
millimeters<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.360> thickness<00:05:30.810> is<00:05:30.990> one<00:05:31.200> point

two<00:05:31.680> millimeters<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.310> thickness<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.000> width

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
two millimeters of thickness and width

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.490 
two millimeters of thickness and width
and<00:05:33.780> then<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.160> plug<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:35.820> out<00:05:36.419> shaped<00:05:36.930> that's
