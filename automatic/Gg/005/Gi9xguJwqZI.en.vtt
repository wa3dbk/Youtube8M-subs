00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.540
 many girls will gather to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 to make the tag a pernicious 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.640
 how is it said it's more by who 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 I was tagged by stone person I 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.050
 believe so here is there as long as I 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.310
 do better than christmas is fast approaching 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 so I start right now 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.600
 question number one - Bernie's favorite 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.630
 the winter so I did not know but decide 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.879
 between two because these are the two 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.920
 with l I'm currently going for the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.769
 winter period so first well 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.179
 one from elf and it's the pink desert 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:47.609
 so in fact it's sand color 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.829
 I love them very much see what I am 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.039
 broken two years violent but on this side 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.170
 that would be good so here is the desert as 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.059
 two students that you must know who 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:05.039
 costs 500 euros and the 376 checchi co 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.969
 who is a rose between pink baby pink 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.200
 barbie not barbie i do not know it's 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.000
 a rostrum is very sweet that I had 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.909
 much much wear in this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.159
 season rather than the pink firecracker that I 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.069
 rather wears in winter then my 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.069
 winter lip products 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:28.039
 so and I turn between three things 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.539
 so already the lip balm so I like 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.700
 well this one from brand green 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.209
 i also use alain bello this is the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 empty rolls blue and honey dream of 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.829
 nuxe world also uses this one 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 the other two are my bag will not go 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:50.329
 there then I use tamales nothing to 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.719
 lips we call that it's the big 5 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.049
 django like that from kiko and that's the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.509
 number 6 1 it's better who is 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.009
 really very pretty that i like m 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.289
 when I do makeup for example 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.969
 common and on the eyes is this one 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.549
 body I make up a little more discreet 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:14.049
 it's from revlon and it's the cdj 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.940
 beatles who are flying and this is the 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.050
 stuttering 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.490
 I believe 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.090
 wales euro 5b wins and it's a 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.740
 bordeaux which is far very very pretty and 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.750
 here I like to wear this one then 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.570
 if I think that's good it's good 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.300
 season then the garment most 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.970
 it's in winter it's the cumulation that I 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.010
 carry their fuel so it's this one 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.870
 because, in fact, he is very sweet 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.300
 cashmere crazy so it's great 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.570
 nice to wear and I love the pattern and 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.210
 it is a bit long so here I am 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.090
 well in it and I love wearing it for 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.530
 Winter 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.020
 number 5 my candle preferring night towards 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.630
 the candle that I often burned in 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.890
 this moment is the one that hinders 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.480
 houses of the world and that's my candle 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.700
 cupcake that is too much there is neither 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.020

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.829

 winter I like to drink chocolate 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.140
 hot when it's cold but I'm 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.989
 the more you are still because the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.670
 Hot Chocolate know it's not all 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.010

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.650
 in the shops the Christmas period 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.599
 long live the wind says miguel baez 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.190

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.590
 favorite dessert dish during the holidays 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.360
 stuffed with small potatoes it and 7 7 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.639
 bounces in input will inevitably have to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.919
 a perfect onion jam 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.150
 and a dessert I like all cases 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.150

 to show you a little bit 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.290
 he causes me this opinion knowing that 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.290
 it's still at my parents' 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.720
 m 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.720
 m 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.969
 2 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.969
 1 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:39.390
 he 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.390
 e 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.310
 question 11 what is there at the top of your 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.840
 list to Santa Claus things for my 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.160
 apart no matter that these nests 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.610
 stuff for my future reports that I 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.230
 would surely take in five to six months 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.970
 so that's how it costs dogs two 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.500
 first apartments in small 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.390
 holes for the door even bullshit 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.360

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.330
 because after I do not need anything 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.860
