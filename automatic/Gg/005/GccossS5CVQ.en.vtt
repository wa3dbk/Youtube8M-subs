 cardboard 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.960

 this eliminatory test is missing 200 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 meters of the beams 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.270
 there it is 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.630
 to put pressure outside also of 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.650
 nothing straight 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.650
 was a 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.530
 of our ranking positions 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530
 automatic 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 come on 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.940
 javier soto 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.470
 sorry 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.410
 ranked vier 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 the first three classified 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 for tomorrow's final 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.150
 then the first three of the next 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.190
 series and then the tournaments of times 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.569
 to test 800 meters problems that the 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.610
 boys change speed they have 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.160
 changes all the way and one does not know 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.459
 really when they are striving to 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.890
 maximum and when he did not have a test that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.260
 presents some peculiarities about 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.600
 everything in the curve to the runners is 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.090
 push and that not only any 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.130
 see at this moment the entrance 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.550
 to the final stretch in the repetition 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.880
 like the ones where it follows right there 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.640
 is still casting change follow look 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.650
 like the three who already qualify once 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.440
 consolidate their positions simply because 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.030
 they look at each other but they know that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.970
 have qualified and release their effort 1 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.090
 5013 look there there you are already with leaving 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.340
 so groping I'm uncomfortable I'm 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.160
 sure then I will save 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.160
 energy for tomorrow that's what you think 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.099
 curve 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.530
 the effort but I'm squeezing in 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.620
 some modes and the last 50 meters 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.480
 as a game for this 800 test 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.160
 meters dressed in blue the Puerto Rican 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.070
 Miguel Rodríguez 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 of earl jones of old the one that goes 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.690
 in still by lanes the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.350
 boys 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.300
 when they enter the straight line in front 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.890
 complete the 150 meters to find track 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.120
 free everyone in and 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.110
 derail 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.240
 runs less inside 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.320
 and the one who takes the lead of the little one 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.320
 espejel from mexico 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.160
 outside for the boricua miguel rodríguez 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.380
 trying to monetize the equal 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.260
 third is the man the speed of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.080
 zions the big man of the test the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.790
 records low looking at the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.990
 cuban miranda the young man is out 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.120
 also putting a little more pressure 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.240
 they have left Miguel in a pocket there 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.370
 this axis is staying with Mexicans 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.400
 this is very fast that is copy of 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.210
 panama whatever it is I escaped 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:53.660
 The Cuban Miranda in the Miguel position 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.660
 Rodriguez on top of the third 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.380
 and is running when 300 meters remain 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.870
 racing 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.850
 but it has lagged behind is 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.810
 lagged the perversity of a step 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.490
 strong usual glue inside being 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:16.560
 released last for electorate not 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.560
 subtracting begins 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.070
 these beautiful flying air in between 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.670
 of everyone counting the passed to the fifth 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.990
 step to the strong passage to the image maker and I do not 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.700
 I know you see it from the speed look 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.650
 God is the man of the highest velocity 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.500
 where it will reach the fourth and 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.320
 they classified special and I without problems 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.450
 and the miranda player was eliminated then 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.450
 the morito a miguel rodríguez 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.020
 and the game 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.140
 immediately by lanes the boys 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.910
 when they turn this first curve 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.270
 complete in the first 75 meters of 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.550
 career without definition the positions 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:11.150
 they spend the 100 more entering approaching 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.040
 to the derailment area we are in 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.210
 alive, the boys are already in the final 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.360
 800 meters and is free to the front pgr of 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.980
 Mexico 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.560
 immediately to the front 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.080
 the humans hector herrera are also 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.870
 in the fight with this being is 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.450
 running back to this is the state of 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.060
 a tripping behind the javier boricua 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.790
 soto white dress with blue pants 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:49.340
 stumbled when they spoke the curve of the 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:51.200
 300 meters are based on the high the 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.050
 fire everyone is running well 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.730
 especially according to herrera running 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.420
 very good miranda who takes the 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.240
 lead 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:02.150
 the Cuban boy in front with great 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.400
 travel 500 meters of faith the second the 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.950
 borrico open your blue and white dress 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.890
 for here the body has outside 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.930
 playing in front has opened off you 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.750
 he found roads he was not buried 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.680
 new to was left back again pushed him 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.680
 boss's ban 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.050
 how good 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:28.630
 in playing a time when there are 150 left 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.630
 meters open well outside is brave 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:44.740
 broken 10 - to the silver medal 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:47.650
 the Cuban as he will see third of Cuba 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.970
 Herrera I'm sure Javier Soto 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.970
 I would be a Moor here
