take<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.920> scenario<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.580> example<00:01:27.000> because

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
take this scenario for example because

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
take this scenario for example because
obviously<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.740> something<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
obviously that would be something that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
obviously that would be something that
is<00:01:29.280> slightly<00:01:29.520> deceiving<00:01:30.060> you're<00:01:30.180> picking<00:01:30.420> up

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is slightly deceiving you're picking up

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.760 
is slightly deceiving you're picking up
the<00:01:30.600> entire<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.619> you're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the entire thing and then you're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
the entire thing and then you're
essentially<00:01:32.040> lying<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.670> saying<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
essentially lying and you're saying you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
essentially lying and you're saying you
know<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.990> fifteen<00:01:34.560> dollars<00:01:34.799> heck

personal thoughts on this is personally

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.229 
personal thoughts on this is personally
I<00:02:13.769> could<00:02:14.040> never<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.549> because<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.879> would<00:02:15.120> be

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I could never do this because I would be

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.280 
I could never do this because I would be
afraid<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.659> someone<00:02:15.900> would<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.260> trouble

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
afraid that someone would get in trouble

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.949 
afraid that someone would get in trouble
because<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.269> always<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
because you know there is always that

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.259 
because you know there is always that
person<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.219> cash<00:02:20.459> register<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.120> the

person at the cash register and that the
stuff<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.569> always<00:02:21.780> blundered<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:23.129> from<00:02:23.400> there

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
stuff is always blundered and from there

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.910 
stuff is always blundered and from there
maybe<00:02:23.760> they're<00:02:23.939> thinking<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.359> I<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:25.319> they

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
maybe they're thinking that I that they

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.170 
maybe they're thinking that I that they
are<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.250> friend<00:02:26.579> they're<00:02:26.790> trying<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> hook

guess you could say loser and ended up
still<00:02:38.489> paying<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> picture

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
could have got away with that but at the

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.890 
could have got away with that but at the
cost<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.859> what<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.310> mean<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:36.150> paying<00:03:36.510> whatever

cost it is for a dinner is not worth in

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.879 
cost it is for a dinner is not worth in
my<00:03:39.060> opinion<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.930> someone<00:03:40.169> lose<00:03:40.440> their<00:03:40.650> job

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
my opinion have someone lose their job

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.199 
my opinion have someone lose their job
especially<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.609> don't<00:03:41.849> know<00:03:42.000> them<00:03:42.180> but

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
especially if I don't know them but

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.539 
especially if I don't know them but
maybe<00:03:43.079> Fleur<00:03:43.349> scumbag<00:03:43.739> Steve<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.250> know<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
maybe Fleur scumbag Steve you know I I

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.219 
maybe Fleur scumbag Steve you know I I
would<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.120> twice<00:03:45.269> about<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.019> for<00:03:46.169> the

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
would think twice about that but for the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.659 
would think twice about that but for the
most<00:03:46.319> part<00:03:46.470> even<00:03:47.069> if<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.250> didn't<00:03:47.459> know<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
most part even if I didn't know the

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.250 
most part even if I didn't know the
person<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.150> wouldn't<00:03:48.540> want<00:03:48.690> them<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.019> risk

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
person I wouldn't want them to risk

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.809 
person I wouldn't want them to risk
losing<00:03:49.440> their<00:03:49.739> job<00:03:49.979> just<00:03:50.250> because<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.699> this

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
losing their job just because of this

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.699 
losing their job just because of this
but<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.840> most<00:03:51.959> part<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.290> guess<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
but for the most part I guess now you

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.479 
but for the most part I guess now you
guys<00:03:52.889> know<00:03:52.949> I<00:03:53.189> guess<00:03:53.879> an<00:03:54.030> exploit<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.870> NRL

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
guys know I guess an exploit in the NRL

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.399 
guys know I guess an exploit in the NRL
but<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> thing<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:57.120> mean<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.109> could<00:03:58.229> be

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
but the thing is I mean you could be

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.689 
but the thing is I mean you could be
causing<00:03:58.620> someone<00:03:58.949> their<00:03:59.129> jobs<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.519> that's

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
causing someone their jobs so that's

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.280 
causing someone their jobs so that's
really<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.970> way<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.389> got<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.750> look<00:04:00.900> at<00:04:01.139> it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
really the way you got to look at it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.319 
really the way you got to look at it
from<00:04:01.560> my<00:04:01.650> standpoint<00:04:02.099> but<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.090> said<00:04:03.150> guys

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
from my standpoint but like I said guys

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.640 
from my standpoint but like I said guys
my<00:04:03.569> question<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.109> guys<00:04:04.229> isn't

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
my question to you guys isn't

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.229 
my question to you guys isn't

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
necessarily would you essentially pick

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.490 
necessarily would you essentially pick
up<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.449> case<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:06.870> try<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.139> get<00:04:07.290> away<00:04:07.379> with

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.140 
up a case and try to get away with

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
paying fifteen dollars for it my
