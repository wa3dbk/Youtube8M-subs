00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.839
 on the street 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.219
 luck beams have something that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.289
 makes thousands of people despite 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.519
 frost and wind he is sent again and again 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.769
 on ice it is difficult to explain 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 on request for payment 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.759
 I remember as a child with impatience 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.969
 I was expecting another ice trip 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:35.830
 sincerely glad 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.490
 after each even the smallest 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.970
 costs 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.820
 at 17 he tried himself for the first time 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270
 winter scrap competition today 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 I do not remember which place I managed to occupy 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 but the very atmosphere of lively warm 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.490
 communication sharing experience 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.470
 and at the same time the spirit of sporting excitement 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.719
 adrenaline rush 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 when I just shook 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.030
 this passion does not subside to this day 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.020
 tenge 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.650
 and every time going out on the ice I try to understand in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.730
 what is the real secret of success 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.130
 fishing turned out to be a simple secret if 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.230
 the bank and how its how the legs are fed therefore 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 you need a light comfortable and warm shoes 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.590
 such as boots norm 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.840
 why norms yes because they have 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 comfortable light 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.320
 with their new team is different 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.430
 surprising ease investor 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310
 Davos in a row thanks to the sandpiper 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 the youth of the material itself is only 400,450 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310
 grams besides materials 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 increased frost resistance therefore 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 the boot remains the stich department even 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.830
 at very low temperatures 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.370
 boots 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.170
 fully waterproof 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.580
 so they can not be afraid to wet 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.690
 feet in boots 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.000
 hitting external transfers because 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 the bleene still has an episode cuff 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.850
 repulsive yet with no 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 latch she tightens the cord 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.929
 m 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.009
 m 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.799
 perhaps the most important requirement 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.699
 a winged shoe it should be perfect 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:16.889
 keep warm 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.219
 boots of another bank provide double 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.399
 thermal insulation 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.039
 since firstly the very base boot 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.989
 Estaev has zero 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.060
 thermal conductivity and secondly 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.989
 boundary matrix is ​​multi-layered 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.550
 warming liner not less than 14 thick 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.870
 millimeters outer layer liners 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 combines politicized 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.870
 the canvas in which reflects the cold and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.860
 unexpected canvas with natural 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 flax fibers that create 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.550
 additional air gap 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.560
 supporting comfortable 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.830
 body temperature and internal 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.000
 the liner layer is made of soft 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.769
 fleecy natural wool and 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.879
 look like an important basis which 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.540
 warms 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.030
 and retains heat even with strong 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.140
 frost thanks to such a difficult 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.219
 liner designs ideally removes 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.370
 moisture and many not only do not freeze 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.819
 but sukhinin remains the most comfortable 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.459
 model use temperature 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.170
 but cheating 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 to minus forty five degrees 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.359
 I know that you these boots my feet 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.959
 always warm these boots changing not 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.409
 let you down i know my strength and my 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.049
 opportunities but boots trendy give me 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.119
 more room for result 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.069
 I choose but to us 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.559
 m 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.279
 and easier warmer more comfortable
