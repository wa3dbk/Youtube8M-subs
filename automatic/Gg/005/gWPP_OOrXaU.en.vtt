00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello all welcome one more day to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 channel how can you be realizing 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.500
 today I bring you another Wednesday makeup 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.410
 inspired by a look of something this in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 particular is inspired by the year 2015 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.799
 georgia silver and the truth is inspired 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 in several of the victory shows 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.550
 centuries because they will present more or less 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 same range of makeup so good 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 if you want to know how to recreate 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 This makeup look I invite you to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.420
 stay to watch the video to start what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.150
 first thing I'm doing is applying 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 this first maybelline baby skin for 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.040
 minimize the appearance of my pores and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 leave my skin as licit and radiant 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.540
 possible for what follows that is the basis 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.730
 I will be using Bryant Bound 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 mimic of the lidherma brand this is a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 base that has medium coverage and I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 I'm applying it with my hands 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 then there is a little bit lighter and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.059
 what I like and why I chose it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.100
 for this victory inspired look 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 secret is because it leaves a glow 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 to the skin that goes super well with this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 look I'm applying firm corrector 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.510
 maybelline to both illuminate and to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 cover imperfections 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.680
 I am applying in the form of a triangle in 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.140
 my eyes making a triangular 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.000
 inverted in my forehead in my nose and in 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100
 my chin and now to blur all this 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.750
 super good look at this trick also what 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.180
 I am applying in what would be below 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.770
 of my cheekbones below what would be the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.570
 future outline and this is going to make the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.760
 outline that we apply is still pronounced 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.530
 more talking about contours we go to the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 tanning powder I'm not applying with 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.100
 a little beanie hat because if I 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.260
 victoria's secret models have a 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 contour well pronounced have the face 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.730
 turn tanned then use the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.680
 polvorÃ³n cyan te and do the contour with 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.630
 a brush a bit more chubby is going to 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.240
 help achieve that effect and now what 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.700
 what I'm doing is a little trick 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.979
 to look a little more Celtic and more 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.930
 thin here is to mark the part of my 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.330
 clavicles and a little part of the chest 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.369
 to create shadows in that area and that 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.369
 generate if a little bit of contour and 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.720
 I contrast better with my face and my body 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.909
 I'm outlining my nose with a 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 little brochita to go according 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.330
 to the rest of my face this the truth 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.330
 is really very much like 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 and now going to the eyes I'll be 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.330
 using the palette of 'maybelline news 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
 and mixing the golden and brown shadow 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.170
 I'm going to apply with sparkles 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.450
 my finger that is a super super way 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.610
 easy to concentrate the colors better and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.880
 the pigments will better focus 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.100
 I'm going to apply all over my mobile eyelid 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.320
 and I'll help with a tongue-in-cheek brochette 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 of cat to give you better definition for 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.830
 that now when we go to blur 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 this process is even easier 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.150
 I will not be using any extra color 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.580
 to blur simply blurred 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.740
 these these colors with each other and going to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 create a look super superbichos or 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.600
 flattering and smoked I'm enlightened the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.730
 my dry arch with a shadow visit 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.260
 mate to raise it and I turn to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.360
 the brochette to blend to mix 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.270
 all super super good 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.980
 illuminated the tear in my eye with wood 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.070
 zombie is golden but a little more 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.600
 concentrated and I'm going to get my eyebrows 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.220
 This is a very important step 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.830
 key because the victory models 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.480
 Secret usually have pretty eyebrows 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.340
 pretty perfect so I'm 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 trying to cover all the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.060
 short I have 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.680
 I'll get you the brown shady 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.470
 shine on appointment in my line of lashes 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.930
 lower to balance the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.700
 eyes look with the bottom part the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.980
 I'm going to blur with my little finger so that 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.989
 it looks a little smoked and I'm going to 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.550
 illuminate the lacrimal of my eye but in 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.860
 the bottom with the same smile 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.390
 golden that we are previously I am going to 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.860
 move on to light up my face with this 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.330
 highlighting palette that the truth 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.040
 liked very much and take the most 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.170
 clarita because I did not want it to look very 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.180
 overload the face and illuminate the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.440
 higher points now what I 'm 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.480
 doing is applying false eyelashes 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.130
 this the truth I recommend it super 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.840
 this in this look because it's pretty 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.880
 necessary will make the look 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.830
 stand out and give it that touch so 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.450
 special that has the makeup of 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.280
 victoria's secret and now what I'm 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.319
 doing is making up my lips 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.330
 applying a lipstick and a gloss over 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.430
 to give all that juiciness and shine 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.080
 who has this type of makeup these 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.590
 they are two tones that the truth to me 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.590
 they love 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.080
 and I'm going to apply mascara on my lashes 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 lower and in my upper lashes 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.940
 to mix with the eyelashes 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.940
 false 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.409
 and so it remains what it seemed to the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.409
 they would use 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.470
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.850

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.950

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.860
