it on a band score grave comes out and

it on a band score grave comes out and
now<00:00:28.800> Hawk<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.220> an<00:00:29.340> awkward<00:00:29.640> position<00:00:29.820> who

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
boast could he secured a double here he

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.959 
boast could he secured a double here he
does<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.579> boots

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
does have boots

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.560 
does have boots
okay<00:00:33.300> does<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.780> concussive<00:00:34.290> comes<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
okay does not concussive comes in I

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.850 
okay does not concussive comes in I
would<00:00:36.570> guess<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.440> takes<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
would guess that it just takes the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.610 
would guess that it just takes the
difference<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.579> yours<00:00:39.020> decrypted<00:00:40.020> oh<00:00:40.350> god

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
difference so if yours decrypted oh god

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
difference so if yours decrypted oh god
that's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.980> rapier<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.780> don't<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> math

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that's a rapier I don't have the math

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's a rapier I don't have the math
works<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.410> does<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> take<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> difference

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
works like does it take the difference

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.650 
works like does it take the difference
of<00:00:44.340> X<00:00:44.520> Y<00:00:45.530> tetrachloride<00:00:46.530> an<00:00:46.800> ancient<00:00:47.280> seal

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660
