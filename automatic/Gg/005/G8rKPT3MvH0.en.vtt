so<00:00:00.420> now<00:00:00.570> we're<00:00:00.719> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.989> show<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.170> some<00:00:01.380> of

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
so now we're going to show you some of

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.690 
so now we're going to show you some of
the<00:00:01.560> things<00:00:01.740> we've<00:00:01.920> been<00:00:02.100> working<00:00:02.250> on<00:00:02.520> since

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
the things we've been working on since

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
the things we've been working on since
we<00:00:02.909> ship<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.210> original<00:00:03.600> gears<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.020> war<00:00:04.200> game

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
we ship the original gears of war game

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.350 
we ship the original gears of war game
now<00:00:07.340> we<00:00:08.340> never<00:00:08.519> stop<00:00:08.820> working<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.240> new

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
now we never stop working on new

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.480 
now we never stop working on new
features<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> Unreal<00:00:10.410> Engine<00:00:10.440> it's<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.010> it

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
features in the Unreal Engine it's a it

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070 
features in the Unreal Engine it's a it
so<00:00:11.670> always<00:00:11.880> work<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.330> progress<00:00:12.540> we're<00:00:12.929> always

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so always work in progress we're always

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.470 
so always work in progress we're always
adding<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> major<00:00:15.210> into

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
adding more so one of the major into

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.910 
adding more so one of the major into
things<00:00:15.660> we've<00:00:15.839> had<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.230> ambient<00:00:16.710> occlusion

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
things we've had is ambient occlusion

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.540 
things we've had is ambient occlusion
technology<00:00:18.260> this<00:00:19.260> technology<00:00:19.340> enables<00:00:20.340> us<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
technology this technology enables us to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
technology this technology enables us to
add<00:00:21.060> much<00:00:21.630> more<00:00:21.840> realistic<00:00:22.140> dynamic<00:00:22.920> shadows

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
add much more realistic dynamic shadows

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.269 
add much more realistic dynamic shadows
to<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.699> ins<00:00:24.650> using<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.710> pixel<00:00:26.070> shader

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
to see ins using a pixel shader

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
to see ins using a pixel shader
technique<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> pixel<00:00:27.810> shader<00:00:28.050> traverses

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
technique so a pixel shader traverses

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.810 
technique so a pixel shader traverses
every<00:00:28.830> single<00:00:29.160> pixel<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> scene<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
every single pixel on the scene and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
every single pixel on the scene and
looks<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.390> light<00:00:30.599> reflects<00:00:30.990> around<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
looks at how light reflects around and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.229 
looks at how light reflects around and
use<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.130> generate<00:00:32.550> much<00:00:32.730> more<00:00:32.940> realistic

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
use that to generate much more realistic

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
use that to generate much more realistic
shadow<00:00:33.719> highlight<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> objects<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
shadow highlight on the objects in the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
shadow highlight on the objects in the
scene<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.450> say<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.840> much<00:00:36.960> more

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
scene you know say you see much more

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
scene you know say you see much more
definition<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.010> individual<00:00:38.520> objects<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
definition and individual objects and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
definition and individual objects and
they<00:00:39.090> pop<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> backgrounds<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
they pop out from the backgrounds this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
they pop out from the backgrounds this
technique<00:00:41.610> works<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.360> characters<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.960> well

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
technique works for characters as well

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
technique works for characters as well
we've<00:00:43.800> done<00:00:43.860> significant<00:00:44.489> work<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
we've done significant work on the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
we've done significant work on the
character<00:00:45.180> pipeline<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.559> left<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
our new character pipeline you see

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
our new character pipeline you see
there's<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:53.280> greater<00:00:53.550> contrast<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's much greater contrast and the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
there's much greater contrast and the

more detail in the character of raw

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
more detail in the character of raw
there's<00:01:01.469> also<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> lot<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.160> efficient<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there's also a lot more efficient and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
there's also a lot more efficient and
enables<00:01:03.090> us<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> render<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.110> more

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
enables us to render a lot more

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.399 
enables us to render a lot more
characters<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> scenes<00:01:05.450> now<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
characters and scenes now if you're a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
characters and scenes now if you're a
member<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.890> Gears<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> War<00:01:08.310> II<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.640> fought<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
member in Gears of War II you fought the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
member in Gears of War II you fought the
locust<00:01:09.330> toward<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> horde<00:01:10.590> consisted

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
locust toward where the horde consisted

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.760 
locust toward where the horde consisted
of<00:01:11.220> maybe<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.760> five<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.270> six<00:01:12.420> locust<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.680> now

of maybe like five or six locust but now

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
of maybe like five or six locust but now
we<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.310> build<00:01:14.460> scenes<00:01:14.880> containing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
we can really build scenes containing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
we can really build scenes containing
hordes<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> features<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.640> over

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
hordes of features and here we have over

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.310 
hordes of features and here we have over
100<00:01:18.299> creatures<00:01:18.630> running<00:01:18.869> around<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.520 

we've<00:01:30.850> also<00:01:31.030> improved<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.540> water<00:01:31.780> technology

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
we've also improved the water technology

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.710 
we've also improved the water technology
on<00:01:32.619> our<00:01:32.770> new<00:01:32.890> engine<00:01:33.250> 3<00:01:33.509> besides<00:01:34.509> the

running<00:01:36.850> underneath<00:01:37.149> we<00:01:37.899> also<00:01:38.020> have

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
running underneath we also have

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.050 
running underneath we also have
realistic<00:01:38.590> specular<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.460> environment

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
reflections bouncing off of the water so

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.800 
reflections bouncing off of the water so
it<00:01:42.490> captures<00:01:42.640> much<00:01:43.000> more<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> realistic

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
it captures much more the realistic

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.080 
it captures much more the realistic
liquid<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.320> feel<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:44.740> see<00:01:44.890> there<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.850> also

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
liquid you feel you see there you also

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.730 
liquid you feel you see there you also
have<00:01:46.210> more<00:01:46.390> dynamic<00:01:46.899> interaction<00:01:47.470> with<00:01:47.619> the

physics simulation tool which enables us

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.400 
physics simulation tool which enables us
to<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:44.070> simulate<00:02:44.430> objects<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.970> are

to so to simulate objects that are

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.230 
to so to simulate objects that are

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
realistically elastic and fluid II like

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.880 
realistically elastic and fluid II like
you<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.690> cube<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> meat<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.650> built

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you see with this cube of meat we built

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.950 
you see with this cube of meat we built
here<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> player<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.540> interact

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
here you can see the player can interact

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.360 
here you can see the player can interact
with<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.260> push<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.830> pieces<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.250> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
with that push little pieces of it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.190 
with that push little pieces of it
around<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:56.910> all<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.270> elastic<00:02:57.780> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
around and it's all very elastic and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.620 
around and it's all very elastic and
buoyant<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:59.340> also<00:02:59.520> scales<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.270> fluids

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
buoyant this also scales all the fluids

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.000 
buoyant this also scales all the fluids
so<00:03:00.810> here<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.140> fluids<00:03:01.620> moving<00:03:01.890> around

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
so here you have fluids moving around

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
so here you have fluids moving around
with<00:03:02.220> viscosity<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.000> surface<00:03:03.060> tension

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
with viscosity and surface tension

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.750 
with viscosity and surface tension
retaining<00:03:04.230> their<00:03:04.380> shape<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:05.310> enables

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
retaining their shape this enables

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.310 
retaining their shape this enables
artists<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.210> build<00:03:06.360> environments<00:03:07.170> they're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
artists to build environments they're

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.050 
artists to build environments they're
much<00:03:07.500> more<00:03:07.740> organic<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.060> real-world<00:03:09.240> ish<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
much more organic and real-world ish you

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.710 
much more organic and real-world ish you
can<00:03:12.210> also<00:03:12.330> destroy<00:03:12.900> them<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.690> thing<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
can also destroy them so the thing that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.630 
can also destroy them so the thing that
we<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.050> after<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:16.440> spent<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> few<00:03:17.580> years

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
we do after we spent a few years

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.370 
we do after we spent a few years
building<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.330> beautiful<00:03:18.720> game<00:03:18.900> world<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
building a beautiful game world the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.050 
building a beautiful game world the
first<00:03:19.530> thing<00:03:19.770> gamers<00:03:20.070> want<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.700> blow<00:03:20.940> it

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
first thing gamers want to do is blow it

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.050 
first thing gamers want to do is blow it
up<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.330> now<00:03:21.840> they<00:03:22.050> can<00:03:22.200> do<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> we've

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
up and now they can do that so we've

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.790 
up and now they can do that so we've
implanted<00:03:24.630> some<00:03:24.900> real-time<00:03:25.080> structural

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
implanted some real-time structural

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.250 
implanted some real-time structural

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
analysis tools in Unreal Engine 3 they

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.870 
analysis tools in Unreal Engine 3 they
can<00:03:28.470> determine<00:03:28.830> how<00:03:28.950> objects<00:03:29.340> break<00:03:29.580> apart

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
can determine how objects break apart

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.880 
can determine how objects break apart
into<00:03:30.000> pieces<00:03:30.150> given<00:03:30.870> stresses<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.560> strains

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
into pieces given stresses and strains

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.010 
into pieces given stresses and strains
and<00:03:32.130> here<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.060> applied<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.930> we

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
and here we have applied that so that we

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.600 
and here we have applied that so that we
have<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.140> building<00:03:34.860> build<00:03:35.220> out<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.400> concrete

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
have a building build out of concrete

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.670 
have a building build out of concrete

with a steel structure underneath you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.930 
with a steel structure underneath you
can<00:03:37.830> see<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> player<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:38.580> around<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
can see the player can go around and
