00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
back but what is that something else

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.120 
back but what is that something else
maybe<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.780> new<00:02:05.960> feature<00:02:06.439> in<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
maybe it's just a new feature in the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.070 
maybe it's just a new feature in the
game<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.520> he<00:02:07.549> went<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.000> specifics<00:02:08.659> but<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
game and he went to specifics but the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.869 
game and he went to specifics but the
thing<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.289> that's<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:09.920> such<00:02:10.159> a<00:02:10.189> big<00:02:10.519> broad

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
thing is that's just so such a big broad

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.059 
thing is that's just so such a big broad
question<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:11.599> talking<00:02:11.870> about<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.739> three

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
question it's talking about the three

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.699 
question it's talking about the three
major<00:02:13.310> modes<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.120> he<00:02:14.930> says<00:02:15.140> something<00:02:15.500> else

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
major modes and he says something else

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.430
