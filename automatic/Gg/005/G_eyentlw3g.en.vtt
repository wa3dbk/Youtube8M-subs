00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
them I felt guilty about eating their

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.300 
them I felt guilty about eating their
food<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.480> that's<00:00:15.660> why<00:00:15.839> when<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.410> asked<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
food so that's why when they asked me to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
food so that's why when they asked me to
help<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.580> find<00:00:17.850> answers<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.720> little

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
help you find answers I was a little

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
help you find answers I was a little
skeptical<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.500> first<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> thought<00:00:20.670> maybe

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
skeptical at first then I thought maybe

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.420 
skeptical at first then I thought maybe
this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> chance<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> truth<00:00:22.769> now

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
this is a chance to get to the truth now

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
this is a chance to get to the truth now
as<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.730> engineer<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> normally<00:00:25.019> take<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> bunch

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
as an engineer I normally take a bunch

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.050 
as an engineer I normally take a bunch
of<00:00:25.619> components<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.400> put<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.670> together<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of components and put them together to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.390 
of components and put them together to
form<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.420> machine<00:00:27.810> any<00:00:28.140> machine<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.310> be

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
form a machine any machine can be

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.849 
form a machine any machine can be
deconstructed<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.929> looking<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> assembly

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
deconstructed by looking at the assembly

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
deconstructed by looking at the assembly
process<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.399> Reverse<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> get<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> better

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
process in Reverse you can get a better

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.319 
process in Reverse you can get a better
idea<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.500> how<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.010> made<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> that's<00:00:36.180> what

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
idea of how it's made and that's what

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.670 
idea of how it's made and that's what
we're<00:00:36.450> gonna<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.930> McDonald's<00:00:37.500> french

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
we're gonna do with McDonald's french

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.799 
we're gonna do with McDonald's french
fries<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.399> gonna<00:00:38.730> reverse<00:00:39.149> engineer<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fries I'm gonna reverse engineer the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.380 
fries I'm gonna reverse engineer the
whole<00:00:40.079> process<00:00:40.440> I'll<00:00:41.010> start<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> fully

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
whole process I'll start with a fully

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
whole process I'll start with a fully
finished<00:00:42.570> fry<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> end<00:00:43.950> hopefully

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
finished fry and in the end hopefully

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
finished fry and in the end hopefully
I'll<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> potato<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.230> came<00:00:46.440> straight

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
all the way back to the beginning yes

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
all the way back to the beginning yes
we're<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> end<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> freezer<00:01:08.010> tunnel<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
we're at the end of the freezer tunnel I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
we're at the end of the freezer tunnel I
know<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.299> thinking<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:10.530> look

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know what you're thinking these look

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
know what you're thinking these look
like<00:01:11.010> potatoes<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
like potatoes but are they really

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.090 
like potatoes but are they really
potatoes<00:01:15.259> let's<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.380> check<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> rest<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
potatoes let's go check out the rest of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.109 
potatoes let's go check out the rest of
the<00:01:17.189> process<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> whole

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the process all right so this whole

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.320 
the process all right so this whole
thing<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.590> freezer<00:01:22.920> tunnel<00:01:23.400> yes<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
thing is the freezer tunnel yes it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
thing is the freezer tunnel yes it's
about<00:01:24.509> 50<00:01:24.960> yards<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> length<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.580> fries<00:01:26.850> go

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
about 50 yards in length so the fries go

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
about 50 yards in length so the fries go
in<00:01:27.360> unfrozen<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.320> come<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.369> what

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
in unfrozen they come out from it what

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
in unfrozen they come out from it what
about<00:01:29.729> me<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> went<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.170> side<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
about me what if I went at one side and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
about me what if I went at one side and
came<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:32.909> turn<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
came out the other it would turn you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
came out the other it would turn you
into<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> graphical<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> what's<00:01:35.640> before

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
into a graphical so what's before

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230 
into a graphical so what's before
freezing<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> these<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.000> cooked

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
freezing so these are actually cooked

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
freezing so these are actually cooked
yeah<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.200> partially<00:01:40.470> fried<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.579> then

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
yeah they're partially fried and then

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
yeah they're partially fried and then
the<00:01:42.360> final<00:01:42.509> preparation<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.409> done<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the final preparation is done at the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219
