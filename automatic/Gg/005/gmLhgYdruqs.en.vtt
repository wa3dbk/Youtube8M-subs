00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
which is still a mainstay on my pedal

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.970 
which is still a mainstay on my pedal
board<00:00:43.540> like<00:00:43.750> I've<00:00:44.110> tried<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.379> few<00:00:44.470> other<00:00:44.620> pedals

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
board like I've tried a few other pedals

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.619 
board like I've tried a few other pedals
out<00:00:45.070> here<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.370> there<00:00:45.520> but<00:00:45.700> these<00:00:46.210> ones<00:00:46.390> always

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
out here and there but these ones always

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.310 
out here and there but these ones always
stay<00:00:47.320> because<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.890> know<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.400> they're<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.580> great

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
stay because I know that they're a great

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
guarantee that I'm always going to get a

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.670 
guarantee that I'm always going to get a
good<00:00:51.280> sound<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.629> RC<00:00:52.960> booster<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.440> course

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
good sound the RC booster of course

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.200 
good sound the RC booster of course
which<00:00:53.800> I<00:00:53.890> have<00:00:54.070> set<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:56.339> I've<00:00:57.339> always<00:00:57.820> kind<00:00:58.180> of

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
which I have set and I've always kind of

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.090 
which I have set and I've always kind of
you<00:00:58.870> kind<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.080> except<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.530> said<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.769> volume

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
you kind of except you said the volume

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.710 
you kind of except you said the volume
pretty<00:01:00.280> much<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.550> be<00:01:00.670> just<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.269> little<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.629> little

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
pretty much to be just a little a little

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:13.590 
pretty much to be just a little a little
bit<00:01:01.900> more<00:01:02.140> than<00:01:02.379> what<00:01:02.530> your<00:01:02.680> amp<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.390> then<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
bit more than what your amp and then the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.240 
bit more than what your amp and then the
gain<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.900> totally<00:01:14.170> personal<00:01:14.500> preference<00:01:14.890> but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
gain is totally personal preference but

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.130 
gain is totally personal preference but
the<00:01:15.370> white<00:01:15.520> pedal<00:01:15.820> doesn't<00:01:16.090> do<00:01:16.180> on<00:01:16.390> an<00:01:16.870> RC

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
the white pedal doesn't do on an RC

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.990 
the white pedal doesn't do on an RC
booster<00:01:17.260> doesn't<00:01:17.710> really<00:01:17.890> distort<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:18.820> that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
booster doesn't really distort it that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.880 
booster doesn't really distort it that
much<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.450> more<00:01:19.659> of<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.780> clean<00:01:20.020> boost<00:01:20.229> which<00:01:20.799> I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
much it's more of a clean boost which I

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.649 
much it's more of a clean boost which I
use<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.159> with<00:01:21.219> a<00:01:21.280> Les<00:01:21.909> Paul<00:01:21.939> with<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.390> lot<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.540> new

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
use it with a Les Paul with a lot of new

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.480 
use it with a Les Paul with a lot of new
octaves<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.290> play<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:23.500> jazzy<00:01:23.979> tone<00:01:24.159> which<00:01:24.369> I'll

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
octaves and play a jazzy tone which I'll

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.130 
octaves and play a jazzy tone which I'll
show<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.820> second<00:01:25.119> or<00:01:25.299> even<00:01:25.840> like

that's a wonderful pedal for thinking

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.250 
that's a wonderful pedal for thinking
enough<00:02:21.610> everything<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.570> AC<00:02:22.750> booster<00:02:22.990> which

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
enough everything the AC booster which

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.800 
enough everything the AC booster which
we<00:02:23.350> talked<00:02:23.530> about<00:02:23.590> before<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:25.450> similar

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
we talked about before is a it's similar

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.140 
we talked about before is a it's similar
to<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.980> old<00:02:27.100> tube<00:02:27.310> screamers<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.820> everybody

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
to the old tube screamers that everybody

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.199 
to the old tube screamers that everybody
knows<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:29.340> better<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.910> has<00:02:31.030> more

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
knows but better in that it has more
