00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hi everyone, you are watching second 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.280
 Part 26 of the lesson will continue the topic of customization. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 barrels and summarize the 24 25 and 26 lessons 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.750
 on tuning all drums drums 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 install so if this is yours 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.449
 stationary drum set 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.019
 then you can make the barrels all the same 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 the very thing we did in the first part 26 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.850
 the lesson 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.390
 but in a more civilized way 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.000
 put plastic with damping ring 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.379
 branded cap for this plastic with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 inside 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:54.260
 barrels then you can put a kick port 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.260
 for the hole of the resonator plastic and 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.939
 be sure to put the kickpad and all that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.720
 approximately cost you 6000 rubles 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.110
 What is a kickpad and why does it need a kickpad 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 this is a sticker that is stuck on 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.909
 plastic instead of where it hits the plastic 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 your beater pedal boils need for 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.630
 ensure that your plastic does not wipe off 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.369
 blows on the barrel beater over time 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 if you do not put a kickpad will 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.750
 wipe the plastic and in the end 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
 your beater fail inside 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.780
 drum and if you paste this one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 sticker 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.630
 that will wipe the sticker and you 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.630
 just and and replace while keeping 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 plastic of course you can do a kickpad 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
 yourself gluing an ordinary small piece 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.500
 self-adhesive film and self-adhesive film 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
 can be stuck in 2 layers 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 as for resonator plastic 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:05.190
 barrels then it affects the density 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.770
 sound your drum and identify it 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.880
 stretch you can only experienced 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.940
 by the main thing try this one 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.970
 plastic resonator and did not give too 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.360
 big drone most drummers 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 use plastic with a hole since 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 you can always inside the drum somehow 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.780
 to drown him has access to those 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.870
 more with such a hole is much easier 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.380
 under the barrel sounds that is substitute there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.530
 microphone or even put it inside 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.730
 if a 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.980
 resonator plastic was originally yours 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.110
 without a hole that you can buy 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.730
 a special sticker that will allow 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 you cut it neatly 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 hole in this plastic for this 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.739
 Of course it is better to remove the plastic and a knife 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.250
 or scissors or needle compasses 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.790
 in general, everyone does what they can 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:18.510
 cut a hole slowly and gently 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.870
 so that there is no burr otherwise then by 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.560
 this burr may form 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.560
 crack on plastic 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.990
 of course you can take a piece 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.320
 self-adhesive film and cutouts on it 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.740
 a hand 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 stick it on plastic and cut already 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.400
 hole circling some round 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.610
 subject for example a cd but too 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.190
 no big hole either 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.880
 it should be about no more 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.280
 six inches finally finished 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.940
 tuning all the drums let's 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.850
 let's hear what we got if 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.580
 you remember we tried to customize them under 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.740
 certain notes for later 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.190
 could it be easier for them under these notes 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.190
 to rig 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.460
 then under the muffled overtone 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.860
 for example gel dampers it in 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.139
 this case molten moon gel 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.690
 mixed with toy gel 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.030
 we talked about this special issue 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.410
 which is called mega damper for 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.590
 drums published May 1, 2014 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.750
 on yu tuba 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.560
 resonator plastic on the volumes can also 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:06.790
 to mute 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:09.220
 if necessary, glue the damper closer to 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.870
 rim where you are unlikely to get 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.870
 him by the wand while playing 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.280
 Well, now we can assume that 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.470
 many questions on highlights 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.510
 tuning drums for you cleared up 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.070
 I wish you all every success for you
