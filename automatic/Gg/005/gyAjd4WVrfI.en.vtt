lot of lot of motorized scooter keep

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:50.410 
lot of lot of motorized scooter keep
alright<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.319> started<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> body<00:00:48.800> uses<00:00:49.800> very

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
alright so we started and body uses very

micro<00:00:51.420> agent<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.890> playing<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> pain<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.209 

armies<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> national<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.140> by<00:01:01.289> design<00:01:01.859> before

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
armies of national but by design before

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
armies of national but by design before
so<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.059> adjust<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.199> both<00:01:04.439> three<00:01:04.920> cores

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so we can adjust we can both three cores

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
so we can adjust we can both three cores
banana<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.510> without<00:01:06.780> having<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
banana and without having to get off of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
banana and without having to get off of
the<00:01:07.890> border<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> adjust<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.990> for

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the border we can adjust it down for

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380 
the border we can adjust it down for
three<00:01:10.590> floors<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.520> three<00:01:11.790> inches<00:01:12.030> for

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
three floors up to three inches for

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.899 
three floors up to three inches for
seven<00:01:12.750> different<00:01:12.930> increments<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.909> that's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
seven different increments so that's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.420 
seven different increments so that's
what<00:01:15.119> we're<00:01:15.299> playing<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.770> driven

what we're playing is really driven

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600 
what we're playing is really driven

attack<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.539> keeps<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.130> confirmation<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
attack that keeps the confirmation it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830 
attack that keeps the confirmation it
would<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:06.979> maybe<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.580> 10<00:02:07.819> years<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.330> decks<00:02:08.569> be

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
would be maybe in 10 years the decks be

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.830 
would be maybe in 10 years the decks be
falling<00:02:09.259> apart<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:10.489> built<00:02:11.030> decks<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.630> will

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
falling apart we built decks it will

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.110 
falling apart we built decks it will
last<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.500> long<00:02:12.680> time<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.340> will<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.760> able<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
last a long time it will just be able to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.160 
last a long time it will just be able to
put<00:02:14.269> new<00:02:14.450> hydraulic<00:02:14.870> motors<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:16.040> think<00:02:16.550> that

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
put new hydraulic motors on think that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.140 
put new hydraulic motors on think that
so<00:02:18.170> whenever<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.800> see<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.250> debt<00:02:19.489> you'll<00:02:19.910> see

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
so whenever you see the debt you'll see

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.759 
so whenever you see the debt you'll see
just<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.480> little<00:02:20.720> silver<00:02:20.930> thing<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.590> middle
