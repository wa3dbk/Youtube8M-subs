00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.710
 It is common for us to take pictures where 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.559
 the subjects and main objects are 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.830
 a little slanted about its background 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.170
 this becomes more evident in images 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.430
 panoramic where it is shown as background 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.949
 landscapes mountains the sea etcetera although 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.100
 for many this is not a problem we know 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.379
 some of us that are more demanding so 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.320
 I will teach you how to straighten that kind of 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.690
 images with inclination we should take 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.260
 consider something even if it's not in 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.420
 our plans cut the image but 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.059
 if we want to straighten up the forcibly 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.730
 there will be a cut and this is very simple 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.579
 understand what photoshop should tilt the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.000
 original image and that inclination makes 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.530
 that the rectangular shape will miss this 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 I'll show it to you next for 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.930
 understand it I have here an image of 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.089
 a beach and we are seeing as background the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 sea we see how there is a slight 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.360
 tilt to the left this 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.840
 it means that it is not just 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.509
 horizontal 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.939
 the cut tool has a 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.369
 option that we saw in the beginning that 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.319
 flame straighten we are seeing this 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.649
 button or option that says straighten 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.960
 it works in a very easy way let's 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.880
 click on it we see how it 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.329
 activate the east button and we also notice 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.759
 how the cursor icon changes when 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.209
 we have this icon the only thing we're going to 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.030
 to do is draw a straight line and that 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.859
 straight line has to be the horizon 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.259
 in this case because we are seeing 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.329
 clearly the sea but in case of another 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.280
 type of photographs that by the way I have 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.739
 another one here we have to take as 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.500
 reference something that tells us the 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:56.390
 exact tilt of the image that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.450
 we take the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.719
 click where the sea starts or the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.180
 line that you see on the horizon and without 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.539
 release the drag button to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.460
 create a straight line that is parallel to 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.160
 that we have in the image I'm going to 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.830
 try more or less to be straight 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.690
 regarding this other portion that I am 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.090
 seeing from the sea and once we 're 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.680
 sure let go of the button and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260
 we automatically see what it does 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.050
 photoshop fixes the inclination leaves 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.120
 horizontally and also makes a 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.370
 clipping this is what I mentioned in a 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.230
 principle necessarily when we want 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.170
 correct the tilt of an image 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 we must cut a part of it and in 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.370
 this example we are seeing what is going 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.160
 to cut out I'm going to press enter with 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.920
 this already we have the cut and the image 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.720
 straightened up I will select the other 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 image that I have here we are seeing 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.420
 here a very clear inclination of this 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.910
 photography we see how this car is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.709
 go down and as in the picture 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.290
 previous we should take as reference 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.080
 something that helps us to create the line 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.459
 straight with precision could be this 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.470
 automobile but I'm seeing for example 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.870
 this street line 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.670
 I think it would be the best option I'm going to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.099
 select straighten 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.560
 I'm going to click more or less here not 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.380
 I release the button until I calculate that it is 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.500
 exactly on the line now if what 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.800
 The clipping is created and the image is 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.319
 has straightened I'm going to press control to 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.569
 z to return to normality of the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.670
 image and I'm going to show you what would happen 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.100
 if we only wanted to rotate the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.920
 image but not cut it out I'm going to do 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.400
 this editable layer by double-clicking 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.410
 in this area and pressing ok now what 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.290
 What I will do is enter the mode of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.230
 transformation pressing control t 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 we see how that box is activated when 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.780
 we take the cursor out of the area of ​​the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.640
 image we see how an icon appears with 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.000
 those two arrows is telling us that 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.330
 we can rotate it I'm going to rotate the image and 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.640
 more or less calculate 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.340
 this right taking as reference to 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.860
 the same line on the street I think there's 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.260
 more or less I'm going to press enter to 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.140
 apply the changes and we see what has 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.209
 passed if we only want to straighten 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.359
 the image but without cutting it they go to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.180
 appear these edges or these portions 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.130
 of edges that's why photoshop 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.070
 when we use the tool 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.730
 crop and rotate it automatically 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.580
 create a box that covers only 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.850
 information about the image and it's always going to 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.350
 happen that I'm going to press control z I'm going 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.260
 to select the cut tool 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.990
 I'm going to move the cursor away so that 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.960
 also activate the crop rotation 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.640
 but having the clipping tool 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.040
 selected one acts in a way 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.700
 different and let's see it 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.140
 as we go tilting the image 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.500
 a box is automatically created 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.270
 within it will never let 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.340
 the edges that we saw make a 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.190
 moment every time we are rotating 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.100
 we noticed that box with the grid 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.500
 that gets smaller always occupying 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.840
 a space within the image this is 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.470
 because photoshop when always trimming 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.600
 will create a cut where you see all the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.750
 image will never leave a blank 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.690
 Unlike using the tool 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.600
 transformation where if we can leave 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.370
 those edges as we saw his moment here 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.470
 we are noticing it for that in a 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.700
 I told you that if you want 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.650
 just rotate the image forcefully 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.570
 you would have to cut it so that it does not 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.200
 see those edges that certainly not 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.400
 they have good looks is better than 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.870
 rectangle or square have only 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.600
 information of the original image and not 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.790
 add a white or transparent color 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.250
 what is the tool that creates 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.580
 transformation we already saw how to cut back and 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.970
 plus 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.129
 is using only rectangular shapes and 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.259
 square also in this video you 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.509
 teach how to straighten the images that 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.280
 They have a little decline in the 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.349
 next video I'll teach you to 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.870
 cut out using other types of shapes that 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.870
 Do not be rectangles or squares
