00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the old ones are pretty good so you just

bit so when you get the car back taking

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.380 
bit so when you get the car back taking
the<00:01:35.610> seal<00:01:35.820> could<00:01:36.000> fit<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.600> lot<00:01:37.079> easier<00:01:38.390> so

the<00:01:49.950> seal<00:01:50.159> from<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> top<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.090> feed<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the seal from the top here and feed it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.569 
the seal from the top here and feed it
all<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:52.979> into<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.210> channel<00:01:55.579> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
all the way down into the channel that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
all the way down into the channel that
doesn't<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:57.090> work<00:01:57.420> especially<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:58.320> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
doesn't always work especially when you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.700 
doesn't always work especially when you
see<00:01:58.590> close<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.670> wrinkly<00:02:00.710> these

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
see close here how wrinkly these

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.310 
see close here how wrinkly these
channels<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.939> seal<00:02:03.240> even<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
channels are and that's seal even if you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840 
channels are and that's seal even if you
use<00:02:04.469> silicone<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> seal<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
use silicone or something that seal is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
use silicone or something that seal is
still<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> jam<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.710> not

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
still going to jam up and and it's not

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.770 
still going to jam up and and it's not
going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> slide<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.459> well<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.599> said

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
going to slide into well so like I said

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to slide into well so like I said
before<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.410> painted<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
before you get it painted you want to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
before you get it painted you want to
pry<00:02:11.610> them<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> start<00:02:12.690> prying<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> up

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
pry them up if you start prying it up

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
pry them up if you start prying it up
after

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
after

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.320 
after
you<00:02:14.040> guys<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> car<00:02:14.490> painted<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> good

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you guys the car painted it's a good

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.490 
you guys the car painted it's a good
possibility<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.930> might<00:02:16.050> start<00:02:16.290> chipping

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
possibility you might start chipping

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.270 
possibility you might start chipping
this<00:02:16.710> paint<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.740> basically<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:19.980> use<00:02:20.160> this

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this paint so basically I just use this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.090 
this paint so basically I just use this
type<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> knife<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.780> line<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.260> seal<00:02:22.530> and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
type of knife and I line up the seal and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040 
type of knife and I line up the seal and
I<00:02:23.760> basically<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.300> start<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.630> pushing<00:02:24.960> it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
I basically I just start just pushing it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.530 
I basically I just start just pushing it
in<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:27.030> stubborn

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
in really if it's a little stubborn

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190 
in really if it's a little stubborn
I<00:02:27.570> might<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.140> silicone<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:30.080> enough<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
I might get some silicone and enough to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.080 
I might get some silicone and enough to
help<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.770> then<00:02:32.460> basically<00:02:32.850> from<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
help it and then basically from the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150 
help it and then basically from the
corner<00:02:33.420> areas<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:33.840> where<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.080> ends<00:02:34.440> where<00:02:35.070> it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
corner areas here where it ends where it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.050 
corner areas here where it ends where it
splits<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:36.570> get<00:02:36.720> another<00:02:37.580> screwdriver<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
splits you get another screwdriver and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.870 
splits you get another screwdriver and
you<00:02:39.120> push<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.510> down<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.170> hold<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.470> into<00:02:40.590> place

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
you push that down to hold it into place

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.970 
you push that down to hold it into place
so<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> big<00:02:43.080> screwdriver<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.710> this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so you get a big screwdriver like this

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.610 
so you get a big screwdriver like this
and<00:02:44.820> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.210> bang<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.840> down<00:02:46.050> that's<00:02:46.440> what

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and kind of bang that down that's what

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.770 
and kind of bang that down that's what
you<00:02:46.740> might<00:02:46.950> need<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.450> touch-up<00:02:48.450> paint<00:02:48.660> to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
you might need your touch-up paint to

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.010 
you might need your touch-up paint to
touch<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.500> might<00:02:49.650> chip<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.010> so

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
touch that up as you might chip that so

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.420 
touch that up as you might chip that so
basically<00:02:52.020> one<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.500> all<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.860> way<00:02:53.040> around

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
basically one do that all the way around

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.650 
basically one do that all the way around
the<00:02:53.610> channel<00:02:55.070> okay<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.060> did

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the channel okay so you can see as I did

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.770 
the channel okay so you can see as I did
it<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.260> around<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.540> all<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.570> use

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it all the way around and all you use

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.060 
it all the way around and all you use
that<00:03:00.900> putty<00:03:01.140> knife<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.380> just<00:03:01.710> start<00:03:01.890> pushing

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that putty knife to just start pushing

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.390 
that putty knife to just start pushing
it<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:03.480> should<00:03:03.540> slip<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.140> pretty<00:03:04.950> well<00:03:05.160> if

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
it in it should slip in pretty well if

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.940 
it in it should slip in pretty well if
you've<00:03:05.970> opened<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.420> up<00:03:06.510> prior<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.140> basically

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
you've opened it up prior I basically

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.140 
you've opened it up prior I basically
want<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.160> do<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.310> same<00:03:08.490> thing<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> front

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
