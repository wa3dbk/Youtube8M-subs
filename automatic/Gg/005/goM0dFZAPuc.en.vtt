 what to do if it is not this 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.839
 idea 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.769
 if you want to learn how to do this 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.960
 video image and comes with a first 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.030
 you will need the figure that will be the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.299
 her tattoo paste her on the paper 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 and now pick up the pen and start 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.100
 pass over the drawing 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.630
 after you have passed the pen over the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.330
 whole drawing you are going to take from paper 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.890

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.229
 same drawing that is on the part of the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.070
 front was in the back because of 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.070
 carbon paper 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.430

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:10.239

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.660

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.190
