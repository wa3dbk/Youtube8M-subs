00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.139
 It is Matsumoto of dark t bar 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.450
 It's been a while since I was blogging, but 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.460
 I think that there was a grip Te What 's Korya' 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.060
 This 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.960
 Say the scree head bk 1 science knowledge in the grip issued's Fujikogyo is once 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.700
 Please 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.590
 In the naked state 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.270
 Such a state 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.330
 In eh 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.660
 If it is a product, there is a merit that it is possible to go along that very way in such a form 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:49.120
 I just do not miss that here 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.690
 At this time, the purpose of bk 1 was that it was light and cheap. 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.700
 Ne 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.540
 So I already glued 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.490
 Because I have a lot of Susan 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.480
 Well, I ca n't use it 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:07.150
 This can be removed 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.010
 It is the flow of development of nest creation bk 1 of this time to try to be a group 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.180
 What if I say if in 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 Even though I was variously thought 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.340
 If you put something like this 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.939
 I respect you 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.860
 I cut it this way and put it on here 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.460
 In the chucking part 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 In this 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.020
 Such parts are included in it 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.960
 with this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.940
 Let's grab a normal color 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.050
 It means that 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.050
 I feel like this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.730
 with this 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.570
 It's easy to smoke 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:50.710
 Put on a pet and do it 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.200
 In the time of the positive it conventional well there was such an idea that is Kedomo do from this with the grip of this scheme 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 Nice together 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.180
 So Kedomo I had that kind of I'm Come has got around this at the time of just under drawback 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.289
 Because it's gone 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.880
 If you turn towards yourself, put it for movement 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.560
 And Well Double 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.069
 I got a bit 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.099
 That very you might say a little bit 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.530
 As we improve part that was bad from youra 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:25.090
 It is yeah to release in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:26.090
 This call grip power gun type group is this and it's a single from it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 cork 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:37.310
 In this same shape eva a black black eva so I will release three kinds so 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.710
 It's also very light and it 's not the reason for that house again 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.520
 Well that 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.250
 Toka there is this kind of leader I'd latest reel such even if Ya want a little 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.950
 It is this to say that modern riff 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.069
 Because this part is thin 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:58.430
 This type is very thin here because there is a grip that is difficult to fit 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.890
 Than you can turn something state-of-the-art reel 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.500
 Not even a porter fan 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.960
 I think it will be a group loved by you 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 Screw is head bk land 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.060
 Another mistake some time is soon released 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.220
 Hmm
