00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
me I'm 2010 introducing a new guitar

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.870 
me I'm 2010 introducing a new guitar
wireless<00:00:16.139> built<00:00:16.440> from<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> ground<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:17.279> for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
wireless built from the ground up for

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
wireless built from the ground up for
guitarists<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.859> real<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
guitarists so this is the real a

guitarists so this is the real a
wireless<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.910> digital<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.740> means

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
wireless is digital and what that means

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.099 
wireless is digital and what that means
it's<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> insusceptible<00:00:24.109> proclaiming

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's is insusceptible proclaiming

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.259 
it's is insusceptible proclaiming

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
interference that analog systems deal

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
interference that analog systems deal
with<00:00:27.420> every<00:00:27.720> day<00:00:27.750> I've<00:00:28.740> ever<00:00:28.800> had<00:00:28.949> Manawa

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with every day I've ever had Manawa

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
with every day I've ever had Manawa
wireless<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.300> felt<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.840> believed<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
wireless I felt it was believed in the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.310 
wireless I felt it was believed in the
vibe<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:32.340> coordinate<00:00:33.120> channels<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> figure

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
vibe to coordinate channels and figure

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.080 
vibe to coordinate channels and figure
out<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.680> working<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.280> city<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.820> another

all that's gone now with the new real a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.090 
all that's gone now with the new real a
digital<00:00:39.149> guitar<00:00:39.510> wireless<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
digital guitar wireless all of the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
digital guitar wireless all of the
channels<00:00:41.370> were<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.750> every

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

city around the world additionally

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.630 
city around the world additionally
because<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.379> digital<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.100> able<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
because it's digital we're able to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.510 
because it's digital we're able to
eliminate<00:00:48.440> technologies<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.649> commanders

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
eliminate technologies like commanders

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
eliminate technologies like commanders
and<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.300> played<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> analog

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and things that have played the analog

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.910 
and things that have played the analog
wireless<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.770> years<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> pure

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
wireless for years so you get a pure

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
wireless for years so you get a pure
representation<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.100> tone<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.670> hands<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
representation of tone in your hands as

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
representation of tone in your hands as
it<00:00:58.140> translates<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:59.010> instrument<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it translates from your instrument to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.020 
it translates from your instrument to
your<00:00:59.730> amplifier<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:01.050> fact<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> product<00:01:02.820> kind

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
your amplifier in fact the product kind

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
your amplifier in fact the product kind
of<00:01:03.120> occurs<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> lot<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> one-foot<00:01:04.559> guitar

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
of occurs a lot like a one-foot guitar

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
of occurs a lot like a one-foot guitar
can<00:01:05.309> soar<00:01:05.700> guitarist<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.869> frustrated

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
can soar guitarist they get frustrated

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
can soar guitarist they get frustrated
because<00:01:08.189> they're<00:01:08.400> used<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
because they're used a little bit of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
because they're used a little bit of
high<00:01:09.540> frequency<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:10.290> off<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> cable<00:01:11.220> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
high frequency will off from a cable so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
high frequency will off from a cable so
we've<00:01:12.000> added<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.390> feature<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> guys<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
we've added a feature for you guys that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
we've added a feature for you guys that
allows<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> sort<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> dial<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> kind

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
allows you to sort of dial in the kind

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.630 
allows you to sort of dial in the kind
of<00:01:16.320> high<00:01:16.470> frequency<00:01:16.740> roll<00:01:17.220> everything<00:01:17.430> else
