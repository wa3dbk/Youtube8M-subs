looking at marking drills we'll start
this<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.420> young<00:00:06.600> pups<00:00:06.899> but<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> good

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
this with young pups but this is a good

this with young pups but this is a good
marking<00:00:08.099> drill<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.880> life<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.719> your<00:00:09.900> dog

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
marking drill for the life of your dog

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.310 
marking drill for the life of your dog
why<00:00:11.610> drill<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.480> draw<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.900> paper<00:00:13.019> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
why drill if you draw it on paper it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.630 
why drill if you draw it on paper it
looks<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> why<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:15.179> throw<00:00:15.450> flat<00:00:16.640> because

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
looks like a why we throw flat because

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.279 
looks like a why we throw flat because
you're<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> downwind<00:00:18.510> today<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.170> we

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
you're kind of downwind today but we

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
you're kind of downwind today but we
throw<00:00:19.560> flat<00:00:19.980> first<00:00:22.039> throw<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.100> angle<00:00:23.490> back<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
throw flat first throw an angle back and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910 
throw flat first throw an angle back and
then<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.180> angle<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.960> throw<00:00:25.230> needs<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.710> be

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
then an angle in the throw needs to be

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
then an angle in the throw needs to be
wide<00:00:26.910> enough<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:28.490> your<00:00:30.019> puppy<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> running

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
wide enough that your puppy is running

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.610 
wide enough that your puppy is running
three<00:00:31.800> separate<00:00:32.369> lines<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.149> these<00:00:33.329> Falls<00:00:33.690> if

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
three separate lines to these Falls if

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.270 
three separate lines to these Falls if
you<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.489> wide<00:00:35.850> throws<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:38.129> can

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you don't get good wide throws you can

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
you don't get good wide throws you can
end<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.870> running<00:00:39.870> through<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> same<00:00:40.530> route

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
end up running through the same route

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.410
