if<00:00:44.910> there's<00:00:45.059> no<00:00:45.180> contrast<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:46.020> no<00:00:46.309> detail<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
if there's no contrast or no detail the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
if there's no contrast or no detail the
camera<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> hard<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.390> locking<00:00:48.660> focus<00:00:49.200> not

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
camera has a hard time locking focus not

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
camera has a hard time locking focus not
with<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> target<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> almost

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
with this with the target the almost

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.270 
with this with the target the almost
like<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> rifle<00:00:52.410> target<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> middle

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
like a rifle target right in the middle

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
like a rifle target right in the middle
so<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> camera<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.030> lock<00:00:54.270> focus<00:00:54.480> really

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so your camera can lock focus really

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.250 
so your camera can lock focus really
well<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.039> nice<00:00:56.309> grey<00:00:57.020> neutral<00:00:58.020> grey

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
well so on this nice grey neutral grey

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
well so on this nice grey neutral grey
you've<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> black<00:00:59.399> border<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you've got the black border so that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.029 
you've got the black border so that
gives<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.660> gray<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> black<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.920> the

gives you your gray and black and on the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
gives you your gray and black and on the
reverse<00:01:02.399> side<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.719> white<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> looks

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
reverse side is your white so that looks

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
reverse side is your white so that looks
really<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.339> too<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.470> you've<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.710> white

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

grey<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.630> black<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.530> basically<00:01:10.979> you're

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
grey and your black so basically you're

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
grey and your black so basically you're
probably<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.420> perfect<00:01:12.840> color

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
probably going to get your perfect color

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.649 
probably going to get your perfect color
balance<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.010> grey<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.630> some

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
balance off of your grey but if for some

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
balance off of your grey but if for some
reason<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> can't<00:01:16.409> tweak<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
reason you can't tweak it with that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
reason you can't tweak it with that
you've<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> black<00:01:17.790> tone<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> you've<00:01:18.810> got

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you've got a black tone and you've got

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
you've got a black tone and you've got
your<00:01:19.200> white<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
your white as well so what you do is you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
your white as well so what you do is you
would<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> photo<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
would take a photo of that as a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.289 
would take a photo of that as a
reference<00:01:24.119> photo<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> go

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
reference photo and then when you go

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
reference photo and then when you go
