ball<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.720> debatable<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.680> harder<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:14.980> get

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
ball it's debatable it's harder to get

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.830 
ball it's debatable it's harder to get
your<00:02:15.310> probe<00:02:15.550> into<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.850> good<00:02:16.090> position<00:02:16.120> there's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
your probe into a good position there's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.840 
your probe into a good position there's
a<00:02:16.930> lot<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> space<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.739> your<00:02:18.340> opponent<00:02:18.550> can

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
a lot of space that your opponent can

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.570 
a lot of space that your opponent can
actually<00:02:19.270> zone<00:02:20.230> out<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.739> make<00:02:20.890> sure<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
actually zone out to make sure that the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.550 
actually zone out to make sure that the
probe<00:02:21.880> actually<00:02:22.300> never<00:02:22.540> makes<00:02:22.900> some<00:02:23.290> sort<00:02:23.440> of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
probe actually never makes some sort of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.640 
probe actually never makes some sort of
pylon<00:02:23.980> or<00:02:24.100> proxy<00:02:24.489> pylon<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.530> know

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
pylon or proxy pylon you so you know

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.110 
pylon or proxy pylon you so you know
we'll<00:02:26.860> see<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:27.489> both<00:02:27.640> these<00:02:27.820> players

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we'll see if actually both these players

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320 
we'll see if actually both these players
are<00:02:28.269> able<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.940> definitely

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
are able to do that because definitely

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.750 
are able to do that because definitely
one<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> big<00:02:32.080> problems<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:33.190> are<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> big

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
one of the big problems what are the big

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520 
one of the big problems what are the big
priorities<00:02:34.300> when<00:02:34.930> you're<00:02:35.050> defending<00:02:35.290> against

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
priorities when you're defending against

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.130 
priorities when you're defending against
for<00:02:35.739> get<00:02:35.890> killed<00:02:36.190> at<00:02:36.370> first<00:02:36.640> probe<00:02:37.140> direction

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
for get killed at first probe direction

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.390 
for get killed at first probe direction
to<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.380> first<00:02:38.560> probe<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.950> probe<00:02:39.190> that's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
to the first probe of the probe that's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.070 
to the first probe of the probe that's
trying<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> make<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> pile<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.209> your<00:02:40.510> base<00:02:40.660> or

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
trying to make a pile on your base or

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.530 
trying to make a pile on your base or
near<00:02:41.530> your<00:02:41.560> base<00:02:43.050> yeah<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:44.590> say<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:45.540> semi

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
near your base yeah I would say a semi

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
near your base yeah I would say a semi
significant<00:02:47.230> advantage<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.370> Naniwa<00:02:48.700> right

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
significant advantage for Naniwa right

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400 
significant advantage for Naniwa right
off<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.030> bat<00:02:49.300> getting<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.780> probe<00:02:50.080> scout

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
off the bat getting that probe scout

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.710 
off the bat getting that probe scout
going<00:02:50.709> right<00:02:51.010> crossmap<00:02:51.940> first<00:02:52.329> that's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
going right crossmap first that's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.590 
going right crossmap first that's
hacking<00:02:53.170> status<00:02:53.769> bro<00:02:53.950> yeah<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.790> know<00:02:55.180> right

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
hacking status bro yeah I know right

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.310 
hacking status bro yeah I know right
it's<00:02:56.350> okay<00:02:56.590> let<00:02:56.799> me<00:02:56.890> let<00:02:57.250> me<00:02:57.340> scout<00:02:57.579> crossmap

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
it's okay let me let me scout crossmap

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.370 
it's okay let me let me scout crossmap
that<00:02:59.320> actually<00:02:59.650> gives<00:02:59.769> me<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.280> least<00:03:00.610> return

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
that actually gives me the least return

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.920 
that actually gives me the least return
overall<00:03:03.209> if<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.299> guys<00:03:04.390> didn't<00:03:04.630> go<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.870> I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
overall if you guys didn't go that I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.020 
overall if you guys didn't go that I
mean<00:03:05.230> if<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.160> did<00:03:06.310> chukka<00:03:06.700> what<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.930> oh

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
mean if you did chukka what is that oh

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.660 
mean if you did chukka what is that oh
gosh<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.959> t<00:03:11.049> remember<00:03:11.320> but<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.519> you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
gosh now I can t remember but if you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.420 
gosh now I can t remember but if you
test<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> out<00:03:13.239> like<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.739> probability<00:03:15.400> that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
test it out like the probability that

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.310 
test it out like the probability that
your<00:03:15.850> opponent<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.329> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.780> bottom<00:03:17.049> left<00:03:17.230> hand

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
your opponent is in the bottom left hand

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.640 
your opponent is in the bottom left hand
corner<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.950> then<00:03:18.540> mapped<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.780> out<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.260> see

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
corner and then mapped it out to see

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.289 
corner and then mapped it out to see
like<00:03:20.860> oh<00:03:21.040> what's<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> fastest<00:03:21.820> way<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.970> scout

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
like oh what's the fastest way to scout

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.479 
like oh what's the fastest way to scout
my<00:03:22.450> opponents<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.950> slowest

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
my opponents it's actually the slowest

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.670 
my opponents it's actually the slowest
way<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.840> because<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.500> cross

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
way to do that because you have to cross

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.030 
way to do that because you have to cross
Mountain<00:03:27.100> twice<00:03:27.630> kind<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.720> sucks<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.290> uh<00:03:29.350> here

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
Mountain twice kind of sucks but uh here

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.500 
Mountain twice kind of sucks but uh here
we<00:03:30.130> go<00:03:30.250> Titan<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:30.700> actually<00:03:31.000> putting<00:03:31.209> up<00:03:31.359> like

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
we go Titan is actually putting up like

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.480 
we go Titan is actually putting up like
a<00:03:31.600> pylon<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:33.130> looks<00:03:33.340> like

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
a pylon it looks like

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.000 
a pylon it looks like
we<00:03:34.670> might<00:03:34.880> see<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> fork<00:03:35.770> yeah<00:03:36.770> holy<00:03:37.250> crap<00:03:37.810> shock

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
we might see a fork yeah holy crap shock

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.640 
we might see a fork yeah holy crap shock
surprising<00:03:40.010> out<00:03:40.130> at<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.750> nanny<00:03:41.750> want<00:03:41.990> putting

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
surprising out at it nanny want putting

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.340 
surprising out at it nanny want putting
up<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.830> second<00:03:43.220> gas<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.960> staying<00:03:44.960> on<00:03:45.080> three

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
up a second gas and staying on three

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.240 
up a second gas and staying on three
gates<00:03:46.570> yeah<00:03:47.570> what's<00:03:47.900> going<00:03:48.080> on<00:03:48.140> well<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:49.070> is

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
gates yeah what's going on well this is

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.150 
gates yeah what's going on well this is
very<00:03:49.640> common<00:03:49.940> PvP<00:03:50.450> obviously<00:03:51.410> he's<00:03:51.590> going<00:03:51.890> for

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
very common PvP obviously he's going for

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.330 
very common PvP obviously he's going for
two<00:03:53.120> gate<00:03:53.330> well<00:03:53.870> nearly<00:03:54.380> three<00:03:54.830> stalkers<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
two gate well nearly three stalkers and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.130 
two gate well nearly three stalkers and
this<00:03:55.580> is<00:03:55.730> just<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.150> maintain<00:03:56.300> map<00:03:56.720> control<00:03:57.050> in

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
this is just to maintain map control in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.110 
this is just to maintain map control in
this<00:03:57.200> early<00:03:57.350> game<00:03:57.680> stage<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.370> he<00:03:58.790> hasn't

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
this early game stage but he hasn't

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.790 
this early game stage but he hasn't
actually<00:03:59.240> zoned<00:03:59.720> out<00:03:59.840> this<00:04:00.080> one<00:04:00.260> probe<00:04:00.560> and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
actually zoned out this one probe and

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.110 
actually zoned out this one probe and
the<00:04:00.830> probe<00:04:01.040> is<00:04:01.100> going<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.340> get<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.580> here<00:04:01.700> Titan

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
the probe is going to get in here Titan

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.480 
the probe is going to get in here Titan
is<00:04:02.510> gonna<00:04:02.750> do<00:04:02.840> great<00:04:03.170> damage<00:04:03.470> but<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.280> can<00:04:04.370> see

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
is gonna do great damage but you can see

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.490 
is gonna do great damage but you can see
these<00:04:04.610> three<00:04:04.940> stalkers<00:04:05.210> are<00:04:05.690> being<00:04:06.350> so

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
these three stalkers are being so

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.870 
these three stalkers are being so
troublesome<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.190> probably<00:04:07.520> going<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.730> kill

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
troublesome and probably going to kill

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.190 
troublesome and probably going to kill
this<00:04:07.970> one<00:04:08.240> pile<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.720> that's<00:04:08.960> going<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.170> be

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
this one pile on that's going to be

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.680 
this one pile on that's going to be
pretty<00:04:09.680> critical<00:04:09.980> oh<00:04:10.340> my<00:04:10.610> god<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.910> big<00:04:11.360> pencil

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
pretty critical oh my god a big pencil

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.910 
pretty critical oh my god a big pencil
and<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:13.340> actually<00:04:13.780> cripples<00:04:14.780> Titan<00:04:15.680> at<00:04:15.770> this

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
and that actually cripples Titan at this

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.830 
and that actually cripples Titan at this
point<00:04:16.870> Wow<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.910> now<00:04:20.120> not<00:04:20.390> anyone's<00:04:20.660> going<00:04:20.780> to

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
point Wow and now not anyone's going to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.720 
point Wow and now not anyone's going to
kill<00:04:21.200> this<00:04:21.320> one<00:04:21.530> pile<00:04:21.739> on<00:04:21.860> over<00:04:22.070> here<00:04:22.340> there's

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
kill this one pile on over here there's

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.940 
kill this one pile on over here there's
no<00:04:22.970> way<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.300> can<00:04:23.450> actually<00:04:23.960> get<00:04:24.200> it<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:24.470> no

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
no way that can actually get it up no

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.940 
no way that can actually get it up no
warpnt<00:04:25.340> will<00:04:25.550> happen<00:04:26.240> over<00:04:26.480> there<00:04:26.630> but<00:04:27.590> there

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
warpnt will happen over there but there

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.370 
warpnt will happen over there but there
are<00:04:27.980> other<00:04:28.370> pylons<00:04:28.850> all<00:04:29.030> around<00:04:29.510> looks<00:04:30.170> like

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
are other pylons all around looks like

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.070 
are other pylons all around looks like
one<00:04:31.190> pile<00:04:31.370> on<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> base<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:32.600> not<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.900> was

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
one pile on is in the base but not I was

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.750 
one pile on is in the base but not I was
going<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.260> catch<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.530> one<00:04:33.680> too<00:04:33.890> so<00:04:34.100> this<00:04:34.700> is

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
going to catch this one too so this is

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.060 
going to catch this one too so this is
pretty<00:04:34.880> much<00:04:35.000> Gigi<00:04:35.380> because<00:04:36.380> Titan<00:04:36.740> actually

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
pretty much Gigi because Titan actually

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.100 
pretty much Gigi because Titan actually
has<00:04:37.280> not<00:04:37.580> been<00:04:37.820> able<00:04:37.910> there<00:04:38.300> his<00:04:38.600> warping

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
has not been able there his warping

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.780 
has not been able there his warping
comes<00:04:39.380> in<00:04:39.530> or<00:04:39.650> here<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:40.550> has<00:04:40.700> been

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
comes in or here but this has been

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.790 
comes in or here but this has been
significantly<00:04:41.480> delayed<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.470> he's<00:04:42.650> not

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
significantly delayed and he's not

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.050 
significantly delayed and he's not
actually<00:04:43.040> going<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.400> be<00:04:43.460> able<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.790> warp<00:04:43.940> it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
actually going to be able to warp it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.330 
actually going to be able to warp it
again<00:04:44.480> so<00:04:45.200> any<00:04:45.380> aggression<00:04:45.770> right<00:04:45.950> here<00:04:46.250> is

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
again so any aggression right here is

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.030 
again so any aggression right here is
incorrect<00:04:46.760> i<00:04:46.880> think<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:48.560> know<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.890> because

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
incorrect i think you know just because

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.640 
incorrect i think you know just because
his<00:04:49.460> his<00:04:50.000> war<00:04:50.210> pins<00:04:50.390> are<00:04:50.510> probably<00:04:51.020> good<00:04:51.290> 20

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
his his war pins are probably good 20

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.100 
his his war pins are probably good 20
seconds<00:04:52.010> behind<00:04:52.190> he<00:04:53.060> needs<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.360> back<00:04:53.540> up<00:04:53.780> but

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
seconds behind he needs to back up but

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.990 
seconds behind he needs to back up but
Naniwa<00:04:54.560> he<00:04:54.890> knows<00:04:55.100> his<00:04:55.310> advantage<00:04:55.670> he's<00:04:55.820> just

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
Naniwa he knows his advantage he's just

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.250 
Naniwa he knows his advantage he's just
to<00:04:56.120> impress<00:04:56.210> on<00:04:57.430> yeah<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.750> even<00:04:59.750> supply

with only three gateways he has this and
a<00:05:27.889> surge<00:05:28.889> in<00:05:29.069> here<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.669> this<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.479> going<00:05:30.599> to<00:05:30.689> be

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
a surge in here and this is going to be

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.020 
a surge in here and this is going to be
very<00:05:31.469> bad<00:05:31.860> there<00:05:32.099> it<00:05:32.189> is<00:05:32.280> GG<00:05:32.610> comes<00:05:32.789> out<00:05:32.909> from

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
very bad there it is GG comes out from

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:43.279 
very bad there it is GG comes out from
Titan<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.939> there<00:05:41.939> you<00:05:42.120> have<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.360> so<00:05:42.870> not

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
Titan and there you have it so not

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.450 
Titan and there you have it so not
anyone<00:05:43.530> takes<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.800> very<00:05:44.009> quick<00:05:44.219> win

anyone takes a very quick win
unfortunate<00:05:45.060> for<00:05:45.210> Titan<00:05:45.689> of<00:05:46.139> course<00:05:46.409> he<00:05:46.590> had

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
unfortunate for Titan of course he had

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.540 
unfortunate for Titan of course he had
three<00:05:48.030> pylon<00:05:48.659> sniped<00:05:49.080> was<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:49.830> three<00:05:50.099> pilot

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
that many pilon slept in that early game

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.770 
that many pilon slept in that early game
stage<00:05:55.580> obviously<00:05:56.580> is<00:05:56.789> super<00:05:57.300> super<00:05:57.419> quickly

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
stage obviously is super super quickly

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.959 
stage obviously is super super quickly

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.580 
opponent of four gates and he's still
overwhelmed<00:06:06.569> his<00:06:06.659> opponent<00:06:07.080> you<00:06:07.289> can<00:06:07.409> see

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
overwhelmed his opponent you can see

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.790 
overwhelmed his opponent you can see
just<00:06:08.400> how<00:06:08.669> how<00:06:09.360> efficient<00:06:10.050> he<00:06:10.169> was<00:06:10.349> that<00:06:10.590> whole

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
just how how efficient he was that whole

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800 
just how how efficient he was that whole
time<00:06:10.979> not<00:06:11.669> really<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:12.029> much<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.270> talk<00:06:12.750> about

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
time not really that much to talk about

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.390 
time not really that much to talk about
i<00:06:13.050> think<00:06:13.289> that<00:06:13.439> game<00:06:13.620> but<00:06:13.800> fires<00:06:14.039> are<00:06:14.219> you<00:06:14.250> have

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
i think that game but fires are you have

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.640 
i think that game but fires are you have
any<00:06:14.550> thoughts<00:06:14.669> about<00:06:14.819> it<00:06:15.060> well<00:06:16.020> i<00:06:16.050> thought

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
any thoughts about it well i thought

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.679 
any thoughts about it well i thought
what<00:06:17.279> nany<00:06:17.490> what<00:06:17.699> did<00:06:17.879> with<00:06:18.029> his<00:06:18.120> probes<00:06:18.479> was

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
what nany what did with his probes was

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.779 
what nany what did with his probes was
quite<00:06:18.900> significant<00:06:19.379> the<00:06:19.529> crossmap<00:06:20.129> scout<00:06:20.580> and

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
quite significant the crossmap scout and

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.490 
quite significant the crossmap scout and
also<00:06:21.210> there's<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.449> little<00:06:21.629> bit<00:06:21.870> where<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.379> was

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
also there's a little bit where it was

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.260 
also there's a little bit where it was
very<00:06:22.680> subtle<00:06:22.979> he<00:06:23.099> just<00:06:23.279> took<00:06:23.400> one<00:06:23.669> probe<00:06:23.969> and

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
very subtle he just took one probe and

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.300 
very subtle he just took one probe and
just<00:06:24.840> took<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.139> peek<00:06:25.349> in<00:06:25.469> the<00:06:25.560> bottom<00:06:25.860> part<00:06:26.159> of

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
just took a peek in the bottom part of

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.159 
just took a peek in the bottom part of
his<00:06:26.430> base<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:26.879> I<00:06:26.969> think<00:06:27.240> he<00:06:27.629> did<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.810> few<00:06:28.110> things

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
his base and I think he did a few things

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.260 
his base and I think he did a few things
I<00:06:28.650> might<00:06:28.860> not<00:06:29.009> quite<00:06:29.279> fully<00:06:29.669> understand<00:06:30.090> them

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
I might not quite fully understand them

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.180 
I might not quite fully understand them
but<00:06:30.810> he<00:06:30.900> did<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.080> few<00:06:31.229> things<00:06:31.289> that<00:06:31.680> allowed<00:06:31.949> him

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
but he did a few things that allowed him

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.100 
but he did a few things that allowed him
to<00:06:32.400> get<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.639> information<00:06:32.849> he<00:06:33.330> needed<00:06:33.539> to<00:06:33.900> do

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
to get the information he needed to do

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.980 
to get the information he needed to do
what<00:06:34.500> he<00:06:34.650> did<00:06:34.680> that<00:06:34.979> game<00:06:35.219> oh<00:06:35.460> sure<00:06:35.909> I<00:06:36.120> mean<00:06:36.629> it

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
what he did that game oh sure I mean it

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.439 
what he did that game oh sure I mean it
was<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.139> big<00:06:37.349> tell<00:06:37.639> normally<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:38.759> do<00:06:38.940> see<00:06:39.120> three

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
was a big tell normally you do see three

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.200 
was a big tell normally you do see three
stalker<00:06:39.719> type<00:06:40.050> of<00:06:40.259> openings<00:06:40.740> on<00:06:41.029> maps<00:06:42.029> like

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
stalker type of openings on maps like

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.550 
stalker type of openings on maps like
Taylor<00:06:42.419> and<00:06:42.539> Walter<00:06:42.839> especially<00:06:43.289> when<00:06:43.409> you're

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
Taylor and Walter especially when you're

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.110 
Taylor and Walter especially when you're
there's<00:06:43.800> so<00:06:44.039> much<00:06:44.190> distance<00:06:44.669> between<00:06:44.729> you<00:06:45.089> I

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
there's so much distance between you I

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.459 
there's so much distance between you I
think<00:06:45.360> that's<00:06:45.539> the<00:06:45.659> correct<00:06:45.900> way<00:06:46.139> because<00:06:46.409> you

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469 
think that's the correct way because you

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.680 
think that's the correct way because you
have<00:06:46.560> a<00:06:46.589> lot<00:06:46.770> more<00:06:46.919> distance<00:06:47.400> and<00:06:47.610> so<00:06:48.389> it<00:06:48.539> takes

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
have a lot more distance and so it takes

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.969 
have a lot more distance and so it takes
a<00:06:48.810> lot<00:06:49.020> more<00:06:49.050> time<00:06:49.379> for<00:06:49.589> your<00:06:49.620> opponent<00:06:49.800> to

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
a lot more time for your opponent to

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.339 
a lot more time for your opponent to
actually<00:06:50.279> walk<00:06:50.430> over<00:06:50.819> to<00:06:50.940> your<00:06:51.449> side<00:06:51.479> so<00:06:52.199> those

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
actually walk over to your side so those

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.110 
actually walk over to your side so those
three<00:06:52.560> stalkers<00:06:52.830> are<00:06:53.069> extra<00:06:53.490> strong<00:06:53.759> probably

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
three stalkers are extra strong probably

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.999 
three stalkers are extra strong probably
like<00:06:54.210> 5<00:06:54.389> 10<00:06:54.629> seconds<00:06:55.110> stronger<00:06:55.440> that<00:06:55.860> they

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
like 5 10 seconds stronger that they

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.490 
like 5 10 seconds stronger that they
have<00:06:56.159> map<00:06:56.400> control<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.050> that's<00:06:58.050> why<00:06:58.199> you<00:06:58.259> had

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
have map control and that's why you had

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.920 
have map control and that's why you had
such<00:06:58.860> an<00:06:59.099> easy<00:06:59.490> easy<00:06:59.789> defense<00:07:00.569> against

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
such an easy easy defense against

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.779 
such an easy easy defense against
something<00:07:01.139> like<00:07:01.409> a<00:07:01.439> four<00:07:01.710> game<00:07:01.860> when<00:07:02.639> you're

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
something like a four game when you're

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.369 
something like a four game when you're
going<00:07:02.939> up<00:07:03.089> against<00:07:03.360> a<00:07:03.509> non<00:07:03.750> three<00:07:04.110> stalker

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:04.379 
going up against a non three stalker

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.100 
going up against a non three stalker
opening<00:07:04.919> so<00:07:05.460> a<00:07:05.490> really<00:07:06.449> nice<00:07:06.599> play<00:07:06.779> by<00:07:06.930> Naniwa

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
opening so a really nice play by Naniwa

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.959 
opening so a really nice play by Naniwa
i<00:07:07.289> think<00:07:07.529> that<00:07:07.680> was<00:07:07.830> just--<00:07:07.860> honestly<00:07:08.849> the

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
i think that was just-- honestly the

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:10.490 
i think that was just-- honestly the
built<00:07:09.180> played<00:07:09.509> themselves<00:07:09.750> out<00:07:10.169> and<00:07:10.319> not<00:07:10.409> any

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
built played themselves out and not any

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.800 
built played themselves out and not any
while<00:07:10.650> was<00:07:10.860> able<00:07:11.099> to<00:07:11.189> easily<00:07:11.849> easily<00:07:12.300> win<00:07:12.629> that

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
while was able to easily easily win that

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.019 
while was able to easily easily win that
so<00:07:13.050> that<00:07:13.710> being<00:07:13.889> said<00:07:13.979> Quantic<00:07:14.610> is<00:07:14.729> actually

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
so that being said Quantic is actually

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:16.610 
so that being said Quantic is actually
up<00:07:15.120> 20<00:07:15.719> now<00:07:15.839> we're<00:07:15.960> going<00:07:16.080> to<00:07:16.139> head<00:07:16.259> into<00:07:16.379> game

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
up 20 now we're going to head into game
