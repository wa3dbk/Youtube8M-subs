 The National Gallery It's the first museum 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.520
 in the world before museums in 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.260
 france the french 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.930
 impressionists bought ours 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.660
 director hugo von tschudi is in 1896 after 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.880
 drove paris and has master there 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
 plants, among others, and manni 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 acquired by cezanne what, of course, then 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.529
 later in berlin in preußen to a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.470
 There has been quite a scandal out there 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.150
 bitter resistance from all sides 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.160
 from the artists of the critics 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.800
 in each case against these two 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 artistic directions and for both 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.629
 Arts Education applies the academic 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.109
 think about painting behind you 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.600
 to let 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.890
 but you can see the big differences 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.070
 of course in the picturesque 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 developments during the topics 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 Surprisingly, very much 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.070
 are the same 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 German impressionism and the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 German expressionism have changed too 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.310
 in the same social 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 situation develops under the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 Wilhelmine imperial empire that was too 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 a protest art a defense 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 social presumptions that conditionally 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 the focus on specific motives 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 how strong are the friends of the country house there 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.009
 are the private motives one seeks oneself 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 Things in the picture before not picture 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.630
 So were done liebermann said 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.789
 a well-painted turnip is better than 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.890
 a poorly painted madonna and that 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.770
 outlines in principle what both 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.509
 artist groups actually arrives 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.429
 you just look for the city 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.429
 the passers-by flane the streets 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.369
 impressionism expressionism were 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.439
 decides whether a culture to the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.289
 industrialization and urbanization 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.810
 the free time is a counterbalance to the 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.560
 complicated urban world are the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.840
 country houses 1 against motive to the street too 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 noisy street is also silent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.340
 interior if you alone this room 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.440
 the bather sees this wonderful thing like that 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.500
 important picture of the bathing by cezanne 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.959
 and in the immediate vicinity of the bathing 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.480
 from kirchner then the bathing of 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.910
 Dear man , this is going on 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040
 all topics in this exhibition 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810
 continue to this wonderful 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.030
 city ​​views of kirchner 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.730
 but besides also at pizarro the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.810
 bridge motives at monet and then 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.180
 again, the topics would have stayed 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.760
 very similar they are even almost 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.650
 congruent but what kind of a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.980
 different intention in the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 painting
