00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.370
Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.580
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the limit switch on the dispenser on your

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.580
refrigerator.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.630
It’s a really easy job; all you need is
a #15 torques, a #2 Phillips screwdriver,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.790
a #1 Phillips screwdriver, and maybe a pair
of needle nose pliers.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.750
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.740
Now to do this repair we do need to disconnect
power to the dispenser area so we’ll do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.689
that simply by removing the top hinge cover;
it’s held in place with a single phillips

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.240
head screw.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:51.210
Take the hinge cover off, and separate the
harness.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.850
Next we’ll remove the bottom drip tray,
it just slides out; set that aside.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:11.990
Next we’ll remove two #15 torques head screws
at the bottom of the escutcheon.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.060
We can just lift up on that escutcheon, pull
it slightly to the left, carefully hinge it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.270
up, and we’ll disconnect the wire harness
to the touchpad.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.740
Then we can set the escutcheon aside.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.700
Next we’re going to remove three torques
head screws that hold that whole assembly

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.490
to the door.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:58.460
Now we’ll work that assembly down and away
from the water inlet tube; pull slightly out

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.889
on it, and downward; you can tilt it forward
and we’ll disconnect the harness from the

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:16.310
back left-hand side.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.440
And now we can take this assembly and put
it on a suitable work surface.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.250
Now that we have the assembly on a suitable
work surface we can change that limit switch.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.580
With our #1 or small phillips screwdriver
we’ll remove that single screw that holds

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.310
the switch to the housing.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.030
Then we can pull that whole switch assembly
up; if you need your needle nose pliers to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:57.730
get it started; just lift it out, carefully
remove the wire terminals, if they seem very

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:07.540
tight again we’ll use our needle nose pliers,
and gently pry them off.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.140
Discard the old switch.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:28.800
Install the new one in the same manner, make
sure the terminals fit tight, tuck the harness

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.120
carefully back in place, and line the switch
up over the locating pin; make sure it seats

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:51.600
firmly on the bottom, and you can reinstall
the mounting screw.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.670
Check the operation by depressing the touchpad,
and we’re ready to reinstall the assembly.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.890
Now we’re ready to reinstall the assembly:
we’ll first of all reconnect our wire harness;

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.960
make sure that locks firmly into place.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.150
Then we’re going to guide that water line
down through this opening taking care not

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.120
to kink it.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.000
Set it into place.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.940
Next we’ll secure it with the three screws.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:47.460
We’ll reconnect the touchpad to the assembly.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:57.180
Then we’ll tilt that escutcheon down into
position; make sure that the top hooks in

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.710
place with just a little downward pressure.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.130
Secure the bottom with the two screws.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:21.770
Put the drip tray back in place; slide it
in until it’s flush at the front.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:38.300
Now we’ll reconnect the wire harness, and
reinstall the hinge cover.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:49.120
And our repair is complete.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.850
Told you it was an easy job.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.130
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
