I<00:00:07.710> want<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> talk<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> some<00:00:08.610> more<00:00:08.639> about

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
I want to talk to you some more about

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.419 
I want to talk to you some more about
some<00:00:09.750> other<00:00:09.929> inflatable<00:00:10.559> technologies<00:00:11.099> we're

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
some other inflatable technologies we're

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.400 
some other inflatable technologies we're
working<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.389> slow<00:00:12.630> down<00:00:12.870> bigger<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
working on to slow down bigger and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.910 
working on to slow down bigger and
heavier<00:00:13.590> things<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.280> Mars<00:00:15.470> when<00:00:16.470> we're<00:00:16.619> coming

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
heavier things on Mars when we're coming

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.160 
heavier things on Mars when we're coming
into<00:00:17.039> Mars<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.760> over<00:00:18.090> 10,000<00:00:18.990> mile

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
into Mars we're going over 10,000 mile

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050 
into Mars we're going over 10,000 mile
an<00:00:19.320> hour<00:00:19.380> several<00:00:20.070> times<00:00:20.340> faster<00:00:20.670> than<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
an hour several times faster than the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.390 
an hour several times faster than the
speed<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.330> sound<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.769> wait<00:00:22.980> until

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
speed of sound and we have to wait until

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.679 
speed of sound and we have to wait until
we're<00:00:23.519> only<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.910> twice<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> speed<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we're only going twice the speed of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
we're only going twice the speed of
sound<00:00:24.779> before<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.439> deploy<00:00:25.740> our<00:00:25.890> parachute<00:00:27.859> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
sound before we deploy our parachute so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.410 
sound before we deploy our parachute so
we<00:00:28.949> wanted<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> work<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.849> device

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
we wanted to work on some other device

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
we wanted to work on some other device
that<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.140> inflate<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:32.099> we're<00:00:32.219> going

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that we could inflate when we're going

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.160 
that we could inflate when we're going
even<00:00:32.669> faster<00:00:32.850> than<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.930> could<00:00:34.050> sort

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
even faster than that so we could sort

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.670 
even faster than that so we could sort
of<00:00:34.230> pull<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> e<00:00:34.620> brake<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:35.130> we're<00:00:35.250> coming<00:00:35.399> in

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
of pull the e brake when we're coming in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
of pull the e brake when we're coming in
this<00:00:37.680> other<00:00:37.860> device<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.430> called<00:00:38.700> acai<00:00:39.120> at

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this other device we called acai at

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.630 
this other device we called acai at

we<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:43.950> able<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.370> inflate<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.090> around<00:00:45.510> our

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
we are able to inflate this around our

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
we are able to inflate this around our
heat<00:00:46.079> shield<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.680> increase<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.219> drag<00:00:47.640> area

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
heat shield can increase our drag area

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
heat shield can increase our drag area
by<00:00:48.300> sometimes<00:00:48.719> even<00:00:48.960> twice<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.710> we

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
by sometimes even twice as much as we

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.330 
by sometimes even twice as much as we
normally<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:52.710> saw<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> crazy

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
normally would be so we saw that crazy

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.799 
normally would be so we saw that crazy
test<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> parachute<00:00:54.210> before<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
test of the parachute before right

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
test of the parachute before right
that's<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.590> order<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:55.980> us<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> load<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.670> our

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that's in order for us to load up our

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549 
that's in order for us to load up our
parachute<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> same<00:00:57.719> types<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.260> forces

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
parachute to the same types of forces

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
parachute to the same types of forces
it's<00:00:58.859> gonna<00:00:58.980> feel<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.399> Mars<00:00:59.640> we<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> do

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it's gonna feel on Mars we want to do

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.380 
it's gonna feel on Mars we want to do
the<00:01:00.629> same<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> saiad<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.210> went

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the same thing with the saiad so we went

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.670 
the same thing with the saiad so we went
back<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> same<00:01:03.870> track<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.350> had<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> make<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
back to the same track we had to make a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
back to the same track we had to make a
whole<00:01:04.949> new<00:01:05.129> rocket<00:01:05.549> sled<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.299> huge<00:01:06.570> one

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
whole new rocket sled it's a huge one

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.969 
whole new rocket sled it's a huge one
it's<00:01:06.930> bigger<00:01:07.140> than<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> house<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.830> weighs

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's bigger than a house it weighs

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's bigger than a house it weighs
50,000<00:01:08.820> pounds<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.540> strap<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.049> bunch<00:01:10.229> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
50,000 pounds so we strap a bunch of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
50,000 pounds so we strap a bunch of
rockets<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.950> huge<00:01:11.250> sled<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.060> drive

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
rockets to this huge sled then we drive

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
rockets to this huge sled then we drive
this<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> track<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.860> 250

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this down the track going about 250

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
this down the track going about 250
miles<00:01:14.640> per<00:01:14.790> hour<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.360> flight<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.930> side

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
miles per hour and then flight this side

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.840 
miles per hour and then flight this side
and<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.770> study<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.820> things

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and we study all the different things

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.130 
and we study all the different things
that<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.210> happen<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> under<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that are gonna happen to it under this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.730 
that are gonna happen to it under this
same<00:01:19.350> aerodynamic<00:01:19.950> load<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> atmosphere<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
same aerodynamic load the atmosphere on

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
same aerodynamic load the atmosphere on
Mars<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> whole<00:01:23.640> lot<00:01:23.820> thinner<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
Mars is a whole lot thinner than the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
Mars is a whole lot thinner than the
atmosphere<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> earth<00:01:26.040> there's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
atmosphere we have here on earth there's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.969 
atmosphere we have here on earth there's
really<00:01:27.030> only<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.360> place<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.500> test

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
really only one place you can go to test

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
really only one place you can go to test
your<00:01:29.220> devices<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.299> relevant<00:01:30.689> environment

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
your devices in a relevant environment

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
your devices in a relevant environment
and<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> sky<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and that's way up in the sky here the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
and that's way up in the sky here the
upper<00:01:33.540> atmosphere<00:01:33.860> pretty<00:01:34.860> soon<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:35.340> gonna

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
upper atmosphere pretty soon we're gonna

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
upper atmosphere pretty soon we're gonna
go<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> Hawaii<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> facility<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.079> have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
go out to Hawaii to a facility they have

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
go out to Hawaii to a facility they have
there<00:01:37.530> we're<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.189> take<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> balloon<00:01:38.670> that's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
there we're gonna take a balloon that's

with<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> huge<00:01:53.729> rocket<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.600> Rockets<00:01:55.049> gonna

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
with a huge rocket all Rockets gonna

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
with a huge rocket all Rockets gonna
bring<00:01:55.350> us<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.950> four<00:01:56.280> times<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
bring us up to about four times the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
bring us up to about four times the
speed<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.180> sound<00:01:57.210> where<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.990> test<00:01:58.409> our

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
speed of sound where we can test our

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
speed of sound where we can test our
side<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> our<00:01:59.939> parachute<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.049> same

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
side and our parachute and the same

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
side and our parachute and the same
exact<00:02:01.829> type<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> environment<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.790> they're

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
exact type of environment that they're

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840 
exact type of environment that they're
gonna<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.479> Mars<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:05.310> crazy<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.700> these

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gonna see on Mars as crazy as these

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
gonna see on Mars as crazy as these
tests<00:02:06.210> sound<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.170> perform<00:02:07.469> them

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
tests sound they actually perform them

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
tests sound they actually perform them
over<00:02:07.920> 40<00:02:08.220> years<00:02:08.310> ago<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.910> we've<00:02:09.209> been<00:02:09.239> using

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
over 40 years ago and we've been using

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
over 40 years ago and we've been using
that<00:02:09.780> technology<00:02:10.140> since<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.039> Land

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that technology since then to Land

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.610 
that technology since then to Land
Rovers<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.000> Mars<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.170> time<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.500> go

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
Rovers on Mars but it's time to go

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.229 
Rovers on Mars but it's time to go
bigger<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> land<00:02:14.520> astronauts<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
bigger we want to land astronauts and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
bigger we want to land astronauts and
bigger<00:02:15.690> payloads<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.349> Mars<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:17.190> want<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
bigger payloads on Mars so we want to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
bigger payloads on Mars so we want to
see<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.090> far<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.599> push<00:02:18.629> this

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
see just how far we can push this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.440 
see just how far we can push this
technology
