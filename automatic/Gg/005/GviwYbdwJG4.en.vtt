00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399 
I say this is that is more efficient and
effective<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.790> team<00:01:18.000> has<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> flag<00:01:18.479> even

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
though you can still get points for

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
though you can still get points for
kills<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> flag

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
