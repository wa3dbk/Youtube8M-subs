see here it seems to be a very very

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.229 
see here it seems to be a very very
similar<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:42.109> completely<00:02:42.290> different

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
similar but it's completely different

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.500 
similar but it's completely different
