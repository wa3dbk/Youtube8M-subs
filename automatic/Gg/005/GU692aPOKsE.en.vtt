00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 install mac os operating system 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.890
 on a personal computer for installation 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 we will need a flash drive of 8 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 gigabyte internet access and free 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.190
 hard disk which will be 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.809
 I want to install 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.670
 This instruction is valid only for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 systems based on intel processors 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 as well as systems that use their 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 motherboards bios 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 instructions for systems that use 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 wi-fi will appear on its motherboards 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 a little later, this instruction will be 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 split into several videos in each 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.000
 video will be reviewed by some 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.620
 specific stage of installation each stage 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 certain will be used 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 application all applications will be possible 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 download the links under the video in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
 description so the first application that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000
 we will need this and up to 64 business 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.410
 edition 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.379
 in this application we are interested 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.629
 service line and menu aida64 hippie and go 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.770
 In this window we are interested in Straw 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 construction set 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.589
 if your processor supports the same 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 my instructions are pretty mine 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.060
 the old processor is about seven years old 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.409
 that 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.930
 no installation problems with you 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 should not arise 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.100
 if your processor support much 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.579
 less instructions for example instructions with 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 with e3 or sse2 then there is no guarantee that 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.890
 you will normally not give the system 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 can 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.799
 if it supports instructions from e4 to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.000
 example of the forest e4 then there are no problems with 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.740
 installation you should not have 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.530
 so from this window to us nothing more 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.630
 need to close it further go back to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.500
 service, select the browser menu and now in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.880
 open the window press the set dsdt button 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.540
 choose where we will save in my 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.270
 case this is the desktop file name 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.159
 change the first part and remove yourself with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.689
 emphasize the bottom instead of leaving 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.350
 only dsdt . ben click save and 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.539
 close the window further go to the reports 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.069
 we select the master of reports 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.560
 we press the button further we select 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.110
 hardware partitions click next 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 report format , choose html 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.610
 click ready and wait until completely 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.610
 report generated 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.760
 after the report has been generated 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.230
 click save to file 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.720
 choose where we will save in my 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 case this is the desktop file name you can 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.600
 do not change click save and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.470
 we close applications completely to us 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.470
 no longer needed 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.410
 and so we got two files start with 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.900
 last report file 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.490
 sorry my english is 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 information about your system i mean what 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.070
 chipset you have installed how much memory and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.320
 what timings do we need this 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.630
 after we install the mac and 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.160
 we will finish the system to full 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.190
 health dsdt bin file contains 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 all instructions and methods that 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.940
 are in your bios it we will 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.290
 edit and eliminate errors 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.700
 who could leave it 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.709
 your motherboard manufacturer and 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.709
 this we will do in the next video
