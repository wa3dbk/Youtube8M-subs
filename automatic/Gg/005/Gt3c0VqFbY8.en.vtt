00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.710
 historically grows like them and let's 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 let's talk about yourself just my weapon here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.150

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.010
 this fashion you can 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.350
 in general, there are a lot of weapons here 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.680
 sleep a couple a couple of residents say what 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:44.170
 I want to make the review short 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:47.230
 so resident resident you are ready to die. 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.870
 and so now look the new tab 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.110
 there will be a weapon that is and that is how 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.410
 ground weapons and anti-tank and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 bombs are, well, let's theme perhaps 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:05.110
 we started trading in general here 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.510
 very many weapons there are very many i 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.580
 I know that he also has a bazooka 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.239
 we are not on the mind to be called at all give 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.959
 the same video effect is such a hole 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:22.030
 punching just one stone 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:25.480
 bird outfit top hits buy eat but 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.380
 that's why that's why they help out 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.010
 Again, there are quite a lot of m 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.500
 many-many 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:39.160
 each weapon has its own reload sound and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
 the shot 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 there is also a slipway where without them 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.080
 everywhere there are people who love 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:54.760
 beforehand m damn eyes learn something about what 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.100
 I am here true if not, that is, if you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.650
 press but not yet fully magnify 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.360
 for example for example like this that is you 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.560
 see where you shoot you don't have 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.739
 recoil that is, all that is if you 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.570
 want so shoot yes and when checking you 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.530
 can not train sight or on board 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.870
 enable therefore in principle it is not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.600
 big mistake oh well also but 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.600
 if i work like i do 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.870
 like the sniper itself is only one 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.780
 magnifies what look in my eyes 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.660
 look let's meet the looks and so 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.440
 she's afraid of something where you went too 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.030
 there are planes let's put here on 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.400
 them and everything is possible if the site needs it 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.889
 put the fuel by pressing the letter p of this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.850
 the menu comes out the button with the type is not the letter e 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:51.080
 letter e you go out 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.860
 from home to plane already all my time 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.870
 and dude do not stop to interfere for all your 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.340
 time 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.080
 can not and did not learn normally with 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.080
 these plane go and take 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840
 eat it up 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.180
 small 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.569
 not very big, I tell you though it 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.569
 to fall asleep
