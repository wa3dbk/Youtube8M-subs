00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 good a chiva is left the split try 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.809
 in caudete 4 with some background playing 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.210
 with the 41 look like I do not know if then I 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.490
 I will change from sniper domination 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.090
 in issuing a few games of letters 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.529
 they are super super frenetic now I come to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.720
 tell a few things because what 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.160
 I was thinking what I was thinking and I 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.790
 personally I believed that the walt truth of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.090
 halo 4 was going to have more repercussion of the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 that the one that is having right now in 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 the channel 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.149
 I did south of halo reach and did not have 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 so much welcome also expected but 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.200
 well I know that which I thought my channel 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.560
 it's not the same thrush and 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.390
 I know I do not usually upload it but from time to time 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.940
 when I want to go up a room 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.400
 of an egg like it was newly evil or like 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.190
 it has been halo I have not climbed 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.610
 also not harassing water to the trust but 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.670
 well I thought that equal fru this of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.410
 halo 4 you can cause and will like 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 more the truth is that they are not coming 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.320
 neither the videos nor the nothing thousand repros 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.360
 for the topic of likes and dislike because 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.630
 I do not care what I do not care if not 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.790
 before seen that an episode then had 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.009
 as suddenly I upload the video of get 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.710
 eight or ten dislike or something like that 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.570
 including me to see the bar 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.480
 red that is that I do not even think that in 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.330
 I look red now 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.120
 something will happen to me or something like that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.300
 directly but I'm very angry that 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.490
 a great game the halo 4 a great game and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.370
 that I thought I would like more of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.640
 what what you're liking not so 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.310
 what what I think I'm going to do if I do not 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.620
 you like the idea so tell me in the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 comments 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.850
 I need a little bit episode to go up 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.440
 I think in the end I got 22 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.310
 episodes and right now I just 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.990
 publish the 13 because I think that what the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.660
 new days that I need is not that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.580
 be sure of how many come to me at the end 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.440
 Well, I think I'll publish everything at once 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.020
 suddenly in one night because 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 total because there are people who do not even 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.030
 you're liking it which I do not think 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.060
 I already went to see the videos there are few 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.950
 so yes, then he gives me sticks for that 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.300
 few people who are seeing equal fru 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.910
 whole then stop uploading it so 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.300
 I think that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.880
 a good idea to suddenly upload all the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.090
 an episode of who let the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.250
 want to see well that you can not then not and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.950
 the truth is that I'm pretty enough 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.440
 confused with the channel because like never 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.080
 I had a specific style of 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.820
 say for example hector hector does 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.840
 funny interviews willy regulates and 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.160
 redoes gameplays commented departures 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.230
 consume what consumes it a little more 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.800
 versatile but they always have their style 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.050
 so closed I have never had a style 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.970
 fixed itself but if you go to go 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.550
 going up what I wanted to go climbing 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 what I wanted and I have never had 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.470
 a 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.550
 own style of the channel design as well 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760
 I agree 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.770
 and say it not as I already told you 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.650
 alioli channel I made alioli dubbing 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.840
 consumer humor unired departure here I have not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.880
 had thus a never a fixed style in 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.830
 youtube and that I think it has 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.360
 Deciding a little what is happening 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.820
 right now on my channel that I have almost 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.740
 24 thousand subscribers and I do not have the 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.810
 network but that should be having 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.880
 so 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.620
 I've also thought about making a channel 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.030
 new and start from scratch a new style 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.520
 and those things but directly is that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.880
 VÃ¡zquez in a new channel estimated at ease 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.380
 with this channel I know that there are people who do not 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.180
 like what true for example there's 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.830
 people who do not like the captive that yes 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.640
 He likes the world so long cruise 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.930
 has tried to interject a little bit of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.060
 the concepts the videos that gone 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.950
 going up to the channel and not to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.260
 early hour to start from scratch a 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.750
 channel with so many videos that I have 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.079
 nearly 700 videos that outrageous one 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.160
 past videos do not speak of 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.810
 start over from scratch comments already 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.570
 I've seen many videos 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.430
 as a plan could innovate could 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.160
 try to do something different I do not know what 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.560
 doing something different is a very generic 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.000
 and not easy to do something different I 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.910
 beginning when it started on youtube that 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.410
 had much more impact v now 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.540
 that I have more subscribers than 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.150
 principle, what I used to do was 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.430
 do 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.950
 will start playing with bartolo with jacques 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.290
 playing with camps is playing with 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.790
 different people commenting on 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.350
 direct and it will be what went up and I would 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.200
 It was great and about what goes up 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.760
 channel that passes face or I speak because I know 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.860
 where the fuck has it gotten since I've been 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.050
 but talk to him about two months 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 no not what with him for everything that 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 dedicate more 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.910
 his channel is not so much Carlos Busti anymore 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.590
 also to me the cases of lately I 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.500
 they are defrauding a lot simply 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.590
 to 0.24 than to any other call of 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.539
 duty and until I take out the assembly to see 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.969
 when something has already one for 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.129
 eclipse or three medium clips more 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.499
 and so a little bit because my channel is 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.049
 conditioning that I played with that 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:32.899
 people and now like I do not play with that 

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:36.860
 people do not upload the same content 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:38.569
 that went up at the beginning and still I 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.329
 I keep having fun playing what it is that 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.019
 what does not matter I do not keep on passing it 

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.019
 Playing 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.780
 but I do not know that much wonder what I read 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.720
 in a few videos of your plan 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.360
 canal no longer mola guanches moldavas had 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.620
 before Moldova tries to innovate not 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.050
 is giving the content that you are 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.690
 asking for your subscribers I know what I 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.880
 I know that lately I'm not climbing 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.490
 no video that says fuck this video 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.320
 in the host this video I loved 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.490
 I know what I know and I'm the first one 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.170
 who knows but created is not something 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.650
 that originality is not something that 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:20.080
 Suddenly say, I already have the 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.850
 solution but something that you can have 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.440
 a brilliant idea a brilliant idea for 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.120
 a video but it's not all of a sudden that he says 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.600
 worth the content of my channel is going to be 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.300
 this this and these points 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.990
 and that I have pretty much doubtful 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.850
 with that topic with the channel because I do not know 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.940
 very good what what I'm going to do if 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.010
 I will continue if I do not continue to follow but 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.260
 we'll see when I take out the assembly 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.010
 neural pull is going to be a solo montage 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.170
 of 24 as you see the one that failed you see there the 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.230
 that the one that failed and here good took the 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.810
 another fran counter seemed like a half 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.540
 good clip and I saved it but well I do not know 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.670
 what I'm going to do honestly with the 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.950
 channel to see if it turns me on that 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.230
 light bulb I think I'll throw myself 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:08.170
 I think I'm thinking about throwing myself 12th 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.340
 without uploading videos or something like that I do not know 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.380
 that you tell me in the 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.140
 comments what you think about everything 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.370
 this that I have commented I want that me 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.500
 please tell me what help 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.650
 very much a single to all and even the 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.650
 next
