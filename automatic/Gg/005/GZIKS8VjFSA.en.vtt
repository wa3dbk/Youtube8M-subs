top<00:02:40.530> part<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.630> sign<00:02:42.900> we're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
top part of it and for a sign we're

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.860 
top part of it and for a sign we're
going<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.440> write<00:02:43.620> eat<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.430> chicken<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.599> we're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
going to write eat more chicken so we're

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.259 
going to write eat more chicken so we're
going<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.140> write<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.620> our<00:02:46.769> opposite<00:02:47.310> hand<00:02:47.340> so

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
going to write with our opposite hand so

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.849 
going to write with our opposite hand so
that<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.690> gives<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.019> impression<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
that it gives that impression of the

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.150 
that it gives that impression of the
cows<00:02:50.100> rodent<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> pavatt<00:02:51.269> chick-fil-a<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
cows rodent the pavatt chick-fil-a and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.250 
cows rodent the pavatt chick-fil-a and
so<00:02:53.160> since<00:02:54.060> cows<00:02:54.359> don't<00:02:54.569> know<00:02:54.720> how<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.959> spell

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
so since cows don't know how to spell

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.460 
so since cows don't know how to spell
obviously<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.459> wrote<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.720> word<00:02:57.900> chicken<00:02:58.200> at

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
obviously I wrote the word chicken at

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.059 
obviously I wrote the word chicken at
the<00:02:58.590> bottom<00:02:58.889> CH<00:02:59.819> can<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> read<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the bottom CH can and you can read it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.180 
the bottom CH can and you can read it
how<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:03.000> write<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.569> like<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.859> stores

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
how they write it like in the stores

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.470 
how they write it like in the stores
just<00:03:05.850> search<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.239> up<00:03:06.299> online<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:08.480> now

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
just search it up online and do it now

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.580 
just search it up online and do it now
that<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.170> our<00:03:10.200> writing<00:03:10.650> name<00:03:10.829> I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
that we have our writing name I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.430 
that we have our writing name I
guess<00:03:12.220> how<00:03:12.430> much<00:03:12.550> dollar<00:03:12.940> we<00:03:13.360> need<00:03:13.599> so<00:03:14.349> you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
guess how much dollar we need so you

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.280 
guess how much dollar we need so you
should<00:03:14.980> always<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.640> cut<00:03:16.269> more<00:03:16.599> as<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.050> can

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
should always like cut more as you can

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.920 
should always like cut more as you can
like<00:03:17.530> put<00:03:17.560> more<00:03:18.129> back<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.900> end

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
like put more back on and in the end

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.750 
like put more back on and in the end
what<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.410> ended<00:03:20.800> up<00:03:20.920> doing<00:03:20.980> since<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.519> had<00:03:21.640> an

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
what I ended up doing since I had an

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.890 
what I ended up doing since I had an
extra<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.330> tied<00:03:22.629> it<00:03:22.840> up<00:03:22.989> with<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.099> clip

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
extra I just tied it up with like a clip

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.930 
extra I just tied it up with like a clip
so<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.110> it's<00:03:26.290> not<00:03:26.500> permanently<00:03:27.160> knotted<00:03:27.730> and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
so that it's not permanently knotted and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.820 
so that it's not permanently knotted and
I<00:03:28.360> can<00:03:28.540> still<00:03:28.810> adjust<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.500> whenever<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.920> need<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
I can still adjust it whenever I need it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.289 
I can still adjust it whenever I need it
so<00:03:32.830> after<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.819> just<00:03:34.000> going<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
so after I have that I'm just going to

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.170 
so after I have that I'm just going to
cut<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.780> yarn<00:03:35.019> off<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.650> I'm<00:03:35.860> going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.250> thread

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
cut the yarn off and I'm going to thread

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.300 
cut the yarn off and I'm going to thread
it<00:03:37.390> through<00:03:37.780> those<00:03:38.110> two<00:03:38.379> holes<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.980> I'm<00:03:39.129> gonna

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
it through those two holes and I'm gonna

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.759 
it through those two holes and I'm gonna
tie<00:03:39.549> like<00:03:39.819> a<00:03:40.000> knot<00:03:40.360> but<00:03:41.290> there's<00:03:41.470> still<00:03:41.620> gonna

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
tie like a knot but there's still gonna

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.309 
tie like a knot but there's still gonna
be<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.190> loop<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.690> not<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:43.930> like

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
be a loop so that it's not just like

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.160 
be a loop so that it's not just like
crushing<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.010> paper<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.940> I'm<00:03:46.780> gonna<00:03:46.959> make<00:03:47.140> a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
crushing the paper and I'm gonna make a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.160 
crushing the paper and I'm gonna make a
sign<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.769> can<00:03:48.010> wear<00:03:48.190> around<00:03:48.340> my<00:03:48.640> neck<00:03:49.170> now

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
sign that I can wear around my neck now

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.960 
sign that I can wear around my neck now
we're<00:03:50.590> going<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.799> make<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.220> UH<00:03:51.430> turnes<00:03:51.760> now

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
we're going to make the UH turnes now

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.240 
we're going to make the UH turnes now
cutters<00:03:52.390> aren't<00:03:52.810> really<00:03:53.140> necessary<00:03:53.769> but<00:03:54.069> I'm

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
cutters aren't really necessary but I'm

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.759 
cutters aren't really necessary but I'm
going<00:03:54.489> for<00:03:54.670> detail<00:03:55.030> over<00:03:55.269> here<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.500> what<00:03:56.680> I'm

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
going for detail over here so what I'm

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.289 
going for detail over here so what I'm
going<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.370> I'm<00:03:57.519> just<00:03:57.549> going<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:57.940> wrap

going to do is I'm just going to wrap

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.199 
going to do is I'm just going to wrap
this<00:03:59.079> yarn<00:03:59.440> around<00:03:59.590> my<00:03:59.829> fingers<00:04:00.280> about<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.910> 20

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
this yarn around my fingers about the 20

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.050 
this yarn around my fingers about the 20
times<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.650> am<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.549> cut<00:04:03.849> them<00:04:04.030> up

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
times and I am just going to cut them up

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.660 
times and I am just going to cut them up
into<00:04:04.360> three<00:04:04.780> pieces<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.650> mean<00:04:06.099> like<00:04:06.310> couple

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
into three pieces I mean like couple

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.280 
into three pieces I mean like couple
pieces<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.269> sort<00:04:07.480> them<00:04:07.660> out<00:04:07.780> into<00:04:07.989> three

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
pieces and sort them out into three

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.780 
pieces and sort them out into three
groups<00:04:08.379> because<00:04:09.099> I'm<00:04:09.220> gonna<00:04:09.310> have<00:04:09.519> three

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
groups because I'm gonna have three

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.360 
groups because I'm gonna have three
others<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:11.019> what<00:04:11.349> I<00:04:11.379> did<00:04:11.560> was<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.860> just<00:04:12.069> tied

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
others and what I did was I just tied

others and what I did was I just tied
them<00:04:12.640> up<00:04:12.670> each<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.720> tape<00:04:14.019> them<00:04:14.230> onto<00:04:14.440> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
them up each and I tape them onto the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.870 
them up each and I tape them onto the
stomach<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.310> make<00:04:15.340> 30<00:04:15.880> atticus<00:04:17.549> now<00:04:18.549> for<00:04:18.789> the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
stomach to make 30 atticus now for the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.340 
stomach to make 30 atticus now for the
tail<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.570> what<00:04:19.720> I'm<00:04:19.810> doing<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.139> I'm<00:04:20.320> just

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
tail so what I'm doing is I'm just

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.370 
tail so what I'm doing is I'm just
taking<00:04:20.650> however<00:04:21.400> much<00:04:21.780> yarn<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.960> think<00:04:23.229> I'm

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
taking however much yarn I think I'm

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800 
taking however much yarn I think I'm
gonna<00:04:23.560> mean<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.100> like<00:04:24.340> however<00:04:25.150> much<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.570> want

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
gonna mean so like however much you want

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.140 
gonna mean so like however much you want
the<00:04:25.930> table<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.289> be<00:04:26.520> what<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.550> did<00:04:27.760> was<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.120> took

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
the table to be what I did was I took

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.839 
the table to be what I did was I took
that<00:04:28.630> much<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.080> multiply<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.770> by<00:04:29.830> four<00:04:30.430> and

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
that much and multiply that by four and

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
and I taped on my ears and what I did

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.110 
and I taped on my ears and what I did
was<00:06:12.330> I<00:06:12.539> hole<00:06:12.840> punched<00:06:13.409> of<00:06:13.650> two<00:06:14.520> little<00:06:14.940> holes

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
was I hole punched of two little holes

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.750 
was I hole punched of two little holes
at<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.570> end<00:06:15.810> so<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.949> could<00:06:17.220> thread<00:06:17.490> some

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
at the end so that I could thread some

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.480 
at the end so that I could thread some
yarn<00:06:18.030> through<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:18.570> make<00:06:18.810> like<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.080> little

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
yarn through and make like a little

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.149 
yarn through and make like a little
headband<00:06:21.110> also<00:06:22.110> as<00:06:22.320> you<00:06:22.470> can<00:06:22.500> see<00:06:22.650> I'm<00:06:22.889> taping

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
headband also as you can see I'm taping

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.950 
headband also as you can see I'm taping
in<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.580> middle<00:06:23.940> because<00:06:24.240> mine's<00:06:24.510> was<00:06:24.750> like

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
in the middle because mine's was like

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.450 
in the middle because mine's was like
directly<00:06:25.380> in<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.620> middle<00:06:25.740> of<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.070> quarter

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
directly in the middle of the quarter

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.149 
directly in the middle of the quarter
because<00:06:27.090> of<00:06:27.389> my<00:06:27.539> head<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:28.440> wasn't<00:06:28.770> like<00:06:28.919> big

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.430 
enough to form I fit my entire head so
it<00:06:32.039> tries<00:06:32.190> to<00:06:32.250> guys<00:06:32.520> get<00:06:33.330> as<00:06:33.570> much<00:06:33.810> as<00:06:33.990> I<00:06:34.020> do<00:06:34.259> so

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
it tries to guys get as much as I do so

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.710 
it tries to guys get as much as I do so
I'm<00:06:34.530> just<00:06:34.620> putting<00:06:34.889> some<00:06:35.159> tape<00:06:35.490> in<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.449> middle

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
I'm just putting some tape in the middle

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.450 
I'm just putting some tape in the middle
because<00:06:36.870> I<00:06:37.110> didn't<00:06:37.320> want<00:06:37.500> to<00:06:37.680> tear<00:06:37.979> all<00:06:38.310> those

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
because I didn't want to tear all those

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.210 
because I didn't want to tear all those
three<00:06:38.729> strands

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.640 

so<00:06:42.220> after<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:43.060> have<00:06:43.330> all<00:06:43.600> that<00:06:44.050> done<00:06:44.380> you're

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
so after you have all that done you're

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.220 
so after you have all that done you're
basically
