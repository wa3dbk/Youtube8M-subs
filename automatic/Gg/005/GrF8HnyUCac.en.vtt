like me you love those ornaments that go
on<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> trees<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.509> today<00:00:07.049> we're<00:00:07.230> gonna<00:00:07.290> learn

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
on the trees and today we're gonna learn

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320 
on the trees and today we're gonna learn
how<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.770> make<00:00:07.980> Christmas<00:00:08.220> ornaments<00:00:08.550> with

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
how to make Christmas ornaments with

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.570 
how to make Christmas ornaments with
chemistry<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.679> me<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> Jeffrey

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
chemistry and with me here is Jeffrey

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
chemistry and with me here is Jeffrey
Vinokur<00:00:11.700> he's<00:00:12.030> PLA<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.679> gonna<00:00:13.769> do

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
Vinokur he's PLA so what are we gonna do

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.020 
Vinokur he's PLA so what are we gonna do
here<00:00:14.160> how<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.429> gonna<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.820> we're

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
here how are we gonna do this we're

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.250 
here how are we gonna do this we're
gonna<00:00:15.089> try<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:15.540> Christmas<00:00:16.020> ornaments

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
gonna try to make Christmas ornaments

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
gonna try to make Christmas ornaments
with<00:00:16.650> chemistry<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.520> using<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.029> process<00:00:18.210> called

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
with chemistry by using a process called

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
with chemistry by using a process called
plating<00:00:19.020> okay<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.560> means<00:00:19.650> we're<00:00:19.830> gonna<00:00:19.890> put

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
plating okay that means we're gonna put

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.820 
plating okay that means we're gonna put
a<00:00:20.369> metal<00:00:20.789> onto<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.750> surface<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.590> using

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
a metal onto this surface and it's using

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.890 
a metal onto this surface and it's using
things<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:23.970> Canadian<00:00:24.359> coins<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
things like to make Canadian coins to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.019 
things like to make Canadian coins to
make<00:00:25.019> chrome<00:00:25.410> rims<00:00:25.710> jewelry<00:00:26.640> building

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
make chrome rims jewelry building

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
make chrome rims jewelry building
materials<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.599> today<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> use<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
materials and today we're going to use a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.439 
materials and today we're going to use a
chemical<00:00:29.010> process<00:00:29.189> usually<00:00:30.029> use<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
chemical process usually use a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.820 
chemical process usually use a
electricity<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
electricity to do it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.709 
electricity to do it
but<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> try<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> silver<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
but we're going to try to silver this

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.160 
but we're going to try to silver this
glass<00:00:34.410> flask<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.790> using<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.570> liquid<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
glass flask and so using this liquid is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
glass flask and so using this liquid is
just<00:00:37.410> using<00:00:37.590> Kulik<00:00:38.160> where<00:00:38.340> exactly<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.719> we

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
just using Kulik where exactly but we

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
just using Kulik where exactly but we
already<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.290> silver<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> silver

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
already have silver here and the silver

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850 
already have silver here and the silver
is<00:00:41.430> already<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.629> flask<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.590> clear

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is already in this flask here this clear

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670 
is already in this flask here this clear
liquid<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.059> silver<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.170> liquid

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
liquid is the silver so this is liquid

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.299 
liquid is the silver so this is liquid
silver

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
silver

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
silver
it's<00:00:47.579> silver<00:00:47.850> ions<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.600> silver

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it's silver ions so it's silver

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's silver ions so it's silver
dissolved<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.329> elements<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.420> have

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
dissolved in water and elements can have

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
dissolved in water and elements can have
different<00:00:51.899> forms<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.920> charged<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
different forms they can be charged and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
different forms they can be charged and
then<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.969> dissolve<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> water<00:00:54.449> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
then they can dissolve in water like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.779 
then they can dissolve in water like
silver<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> change

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
silver here and then we have to change

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.760 
silver here and then we have to change
it<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> its<00:00:57.149> solid<00:00:57.600> form<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> mirror

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it to its solid form to make the mirror

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
it to its solid form to make the mirror
so<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> secret

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so to do that we have here the secret

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.450 
so to do that we have here the secret
ingredient<00:01:01.230> okay<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
ingredient okay this is actually just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
ingredient okay this is actually just
sugar<00:01:02.760> water<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> warmed<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
sugar water which I warmed up a little

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
sugar water which I warmed up a little
bit<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> you're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> help<00:01:05.460> me<00:01:05.549> with

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
bit and you're going to help me with

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
bit and you're going to help me with
this<00:01:05.729> experiment<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> try<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> make<00:01:06.900> two

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
this experiment we can try to make two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
this experiment we can try to make two
of<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.409> excellent<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.369> step<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of these excellent so step one and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
of these excellent so step one and
putting<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> safety<00:01:10.260> goggles<00:01:10.939> I'm<00:01:11.939> ready

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
putting on the safety goggles I'm ready

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.490 
putting on the safety goggles I'm ready
and<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> second<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> take

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and so in a second we're going to take

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
and so in a second we're going to take
off<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> yellow<00:01:13.920> cap<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.610> quickly

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
off the yellow cap and then quickly

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
off the yellow cap and then quickly
we're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> pour<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> sugar<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we're going to pour the sugar into the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
we're going to pour the sugar into the
dissolve<00:01:17.280> silver<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
dissolve silver and then we're going to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
dissolve silver and then we're going to
put<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> cap<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> need<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> shake

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
put on the cap and then we need to shake

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249 
put on the cap and then we need to shake
it<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.119> need<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> shake<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it we need to shake it so that the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
it we need to shake it so that the
liquid<00:01:22.409> covers<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> entire<00:01:23.460> flask<00:01:23.850> sure

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
liquid covers the entire flask sure

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.490 
liquid covers the entire flask sure
thing<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.689> what's<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> happen<00:01:25.380> between

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
thing so what's going to happen between

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
thing so what's going to happen between
the<00:01:25.710> sugar<00:01:25.860> water<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:27.090> liquid<00:01:27.780> silver

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the sugar water and the liquid silver

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
the sugar water and the liquid silver
this<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> reactions<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> happen<00:01:29.850> it's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
this a reactions going to happen it's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.789 
this a reactions going to happen it's
called<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> redox<00:01:30.750> reaction<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.470> basically

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
called a redox reaction and basically

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
called a redox reaction and basically
the<00:01:32.549> silver<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.570> has<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> positive

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the silver right now has a positive

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
the silver right now has a positive
charge<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> goes<00:01:35.640> neutral<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> turns

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
charge and when it goes neutral it turns

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
charge and when it goes neutral it turns
into<00:01:36.659> silver<00:01:36.900> metal<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.380> should<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
into silver metal and we should see that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.100 
into silver metal and we should see that
by<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> formation<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.210> metal<00:01:39.509> mirror

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
by the formation of the metal mirror

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.940 
by the formation of the metal mirror
let's<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:40.680> ready

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
let's do it I'm ready

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090 
let's do it I'm ready
okay<00:01:41.340> okay<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.939> cap<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> okay<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.920> take

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
okay okay I'm cap it okay and then take

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
okay okay I'm cap it okay and then take
the<00:01:44.220> sugar<00:01:44.369> water<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.509> three<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.649> get

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the sugar water and on three up one get

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
the sugar water and on three up one get
a<00:01:47.220> fourth<00:01:47.430> fast<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.880> cap<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
a fourth fast then cap it and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
a fourth fast then cap it and then
really<00:01:48.750> shake<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.170> 1k<00:01:49.560> -<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.280> watch

take<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> slowly<00:02:06.060> changing<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> little

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
take a slowly changing we got a little

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.520 
take a slowly changing we got a little
bit<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> reflection<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:10.319> up

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
bit of a reflection here it can take up

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.570 
bit of a reflection here it can take up
to<00:02:10.800> two<00:02:10.979> minutes

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to two minutes

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.330 
to two minutes
stick<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.420> Ziya<00:02:12.690> no<00:02:13.020> prob

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
stick with me Ziya no prob

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.940 
stick with me Ziya no prob
I'm<00:02:13.940> working<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.540> my<00:02:14.780> muscles<00:02:15.019> right<00:02:15.590> now<00:02:15.739> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
I'm working out my muscles right now it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.670 
I'm working out my muscles right now it
may<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.610> workout<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.629> slowly<00:02:17.930> building<00:02:18.530> up

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
may be a workout it's slowly building up

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.860 
may be a workout it's slowly building up
that<00:02:18.709> silver<00:02:19.310> surface<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.660> are<00:02:20.780> we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
that silver surface so what are we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.020 
that silver surface so what are we
looking<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.830> gonna<00:02:22.010> slowly<00:02:22.459> sort<00:02:22.940> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
looking for is this gonna slowly sort of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.970 
looking for is this gonna slowly sort of
like<00:02:23.239> cap<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.870> inside<00:02:24.290> are<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.680> yeah<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
like cap the inside are we yeah the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.100 
like cap the inside are we yeah the
reaction<00:02:25.430> proceeds<00:02:25.790> slowly<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.780> silver

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
reaction proceeds slowly and the silver

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.589 
reaction proceeds slowly and the silver
is<00:02:27.230> being<00:02:27.440> deposited<00:02:27.739> onto<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.519> globe<00:02:28.760> there

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
is being deposited onto the globe there

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.160 
is being deposited onto the globe there
we<00:02:29.750> go

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
we go

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.229 
we go
can<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.739> yourself<00:02:30.860> yes<00:02:31.340> all<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.910> sudden

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
can you see yourself yes all of a sudden

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.150 
can you see yourself yes all of a sudden
it's<00:02:32.390> become<00:02:32.750> mirrored<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.379> it's<00:02:33.530> shinier

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
it's become mirrored and it's shinier

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.339 
it's become mirrored and it's shinier
like<00:02:34.370> ten<00:02:34.610> more<00:02:34.760> seconds<00:02:35.180> okay<00:02:35.299> keep<00:02:35.780> going

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
like ten more seconds okay keep going

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.300 
like ten more seconds okay keep going
excellent<00:02:37.190> five<00:02:38.000> more<00:02:38.239> seconds<00:02:38.680> okay<00:02:39.680> all

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
excellent five more seconds okay all

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.509 
excellent five more seconds okay all
right<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:41.930> put<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.349> just<00:02:42.530> down<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.250> this

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
right so we can put it just down on this

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.180 
right so we can put it just down on this
little<00:02:43.730> okay<00:02:44.450> look<00:02:45.290> at<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:45.950> actually

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
little okay look at this we can actually

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
little okay look at this we can actually
zoom<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.239> say<00:02:47.390> hello<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:48.200> our

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
zoom in and we can say hello to our

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.650 
zoom in and we can say hello to our
camera<00:02:48.890> operators<00:02:49.459> oh<00:02:49.640> look<00:02:50.239> at<00:02:50.390> that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
camera operators oh look at that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.589 
camera operators oh look at that
yes<00:02:51.370> absolutely<00:02:52.370> see<00:02:52.610> them<00:02:52.730> there<00:02:52.940> wonder<00:02:53.480> the

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
yes absolutely see them there wonder the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.690 
yes absolutely see them there wonder the
reflection<00:02:53.989> we<00:02:54.079> can<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.349> ourselves<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.040> so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
reflection we can see ourselves and so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.580 
reflection we can see ourselves and so
this<00:02:56.150> mirror<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.540> made<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.900> silver<00:02:57.170> we<00:02:57.380> use<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
this mirror is made of silver we use the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.670 
this mirror is made of silver we use the
chemical<00:02:58.010> process<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.720> all<00:02:59.720> metals<00:03:00.230> reflect

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
chemical process and all metals reflect

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.110 
chemical process and all metals reflect
light<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.129> they<00:03:01.220> reflect<00:03:01.430> light<00:03:01.610> slightly

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
light but they reflect light slightly

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.270 
light but they reflect light slightly
differently<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:03.049> example<00:03:03.110> gold<00:03:03.680> reflects

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
differently for example gold reflects

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.190 
differently for example gold reflects
more<00:03:04.430> yellow<00:03:04.700> light<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:06.019> color

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
more yellow light so it's that color

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.890 
more yellow light so it's that color
copper<00:03:07.040> reflects<00:03:07.400> more<00:03:07.549> red<00:03:07.790> light<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.510> silver

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
copper reflects more red light so silver

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.140 
copper reflects more red light so silver
it's<00:03:09.379> nice<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:10.040> for<00:03:10.280> reflection<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.910> skin

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
it's nice to for reflection of skin

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.660 
it's nice to for reflection of skin
because<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.660> gives<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.870> light<00:03:12.110> slight<00:03:13.040> red<00:03:13.370> tone

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
because it gives a light slight red tone

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.420 
because it gives a light slight red tone
and<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:15.019> expensive<00:03:15.440> mirrors<00:03:15.799> use<00:03:16.099> silver

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and so the expensive mirrors use silver

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190 
and so the expensive mirrors use silver
the<00:03:16.640> cheaper<00:03:16.910> ones<00:03:17.090> use<00:03:17.239> aluminum<00:03:17.720> which

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the cheaper ones use aluminum which

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.199 
the cheaper ones use aluminum which
reflects<00:03:18.500> more<00:03:18.620> blue<00:03:18.859> light

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
reflects more blue light

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.610 
reflects more blue light
