black roof the roof is actually a vinyl
coating<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:57.090> take<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
coating on there so you could take that

definitive list but it has got split we
split<00:01:39.210> rear<00:01:39.329> window<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.810> been<00:01:39.900> grafted<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
split rear window has been grafted in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
split rear window has been grafted in
and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.310> what's<00:01:41.460> called<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> Pope's<00:01:41.970> nose

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and I think what's called a Pope's nose

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.870 
and I think what's called a Pope's nose
bootlid<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.350> call<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.880> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
bootlid I think they call this is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.690 
bootlid I think they call this is
fiberglass<00:01:46.460> as<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> wings<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
fiberglass as a think of the wings and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
fiberglass as a think of the wings and
it's<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.570> before<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.170> was

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's also been just before we got it was

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.569 
it's also been just before we got it was
completely<00:01:52.649> reet<00:01:52.890> rimmed<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.250> black<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
completely reet rimmed in black and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.749 
completely reet rimmed in black and
white<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.880> nice<00:01:54.060> sort<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.360> black<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.439> white

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
white so nice sort of black and white
