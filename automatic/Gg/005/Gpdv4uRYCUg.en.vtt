00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
something

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
something
this<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.609> just<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.999> test<00:01:48.240> input<00:01:48.840> since<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.319> have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this is just a test input since we have

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.429 
this is just a test input since we have
work<00:01:50.149> on<00:01:51.149> medium<00:01:51.630> Kalman

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.000 

you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.729> that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.670 

if<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.880> annoying

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.560 

and<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:04.160> don't<00:02:04.220> think<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.760> real<00:02:04.940> need<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.330> turn

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and I don't think it real need to turn

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.950 
and I don't think it real need to turn
it<00:02:05.690> up<00:02:05.810> all<00:02:06.050> right<00:02:06.200> but<00:02:06.550> if<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.730> did<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.240> could<00:02:08.390> do

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
it up all right but if I did I could do

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.690 
it up all right but if I did I could do
that<00:02:09.820> level<00:02:10.820> six

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that level six

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.100 
that level six
seven<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.660> nine<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
seven a nine and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.520 
seven a nine and
some<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.800> chart<00:02:20.070> here<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.280> two

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
some of the chart here the two

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.190 
some of the chart here the two
temperature

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
temperature

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.500 
temperature
the<00:02:24.740> highest<00:02:25.130> was<00:02:25.310> 430<00:02:26.120> degrees

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.190 

so<00:02:29.849> that's<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.120> I'll<00:02:31.390> continue<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:34.049> round<00:02:35.049> this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
so that's it I'll continue to round this

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.030 
so that's it I'll continue to round this
up<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.420> that's<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.870> induction<00:02:40.440> cooktop<00:02:41.440> this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
up and that's the induction cooktop this

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.660 
up and that's the induction cooktop this
we're<00:02:43.580> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.879> use<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:45.430> replace<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
we're going to use to replace the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.619 
we're going to use to replace the
propane<00:02:47.950> gas<00:02:48.950> topic<00:02:49.519> offices<00:02:50.060> -<00:02:50.239> ever<00:02:50.390> since

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
propane gas topic offices - ever since

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.710 
propane gas topic offices - ever since
I'll<00:02:50.840> do<00:02:50.989> all<00:02:51.049> in<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.349> cooking

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
I'll do all in this cooking

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.190 
I'll do all in this cooking
ok<00:02:53.860> that's<00:02:54.860> it
