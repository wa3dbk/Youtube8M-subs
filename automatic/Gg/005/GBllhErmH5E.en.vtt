00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.670
 very good in this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.769
 teach how to bind a book or make yourself 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.360
 your own notebook I'm going to do it 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.990
 little boy to make me a little notebook 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.339
 of notes 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.370
 we are going to need the sheets we are going to use 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.740
 for the book 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.640
 let's also use 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.430
 a little thread 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.660
 let's use 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.600
 a sewing needle 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.480
 very well we started 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.670
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.090
 take the leaves that we have for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.010
 bind and 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.480
 fold them in this way to make a 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.480
 little notebook 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.600
 once we have that we go 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.260
 imaginatively to mark three points one 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.430
 central and another one or two centimeters to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 each side 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.360
 once this is done we will take our 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.580
 needle and we're going to put it with the thread or 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 be and the talk 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.229
 Once we have the needle and the girl 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.230
 let's make a little knuckle here at 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.390
 final 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.360
 so that it does not come out in the thread 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.970
 there I in this case I caught it 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.100
 more or less half a meter but a little 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.190
 with about 30 centimeters worth we're going to 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.190
 catch now 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.300
 the little book like this and we're going so 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.260
 that we had done more or less than 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.760
 center to press until it crosses 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.760
 he was very careful 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.440
 A) Yes 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.380
 in this way 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.220
 let's throw and until more or less 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.220
 come to the end 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.110
 more or less we leave a little bit like that 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.549
 now let's catch and for the other point 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.759
 that we had more or less thought we are going to 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.930
 do the same 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.840
 let's enter here 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.640
 squeezing very carefully if you 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.640
 you can not and you can help from a thimble 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.530
 or if you do not turn it around and we 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.530
 you help with the same table 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.060
 very careful that we 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.700
 the thread 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.069
 that often happens we throw 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.969
 in this way 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.249
 and now we will introduce the thread 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:50.370
 the needle again through the little hole that 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.370
 we had done at first so 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 what I said before much care for 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.810
 that you do not like 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.880
 and now from here we are going to move to this 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.540
 another side that we had also thought 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.090
 before 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.650
 we squeeze 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.950
 and with the help of an old table or 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.950
 something 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.230
 in this way 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.230
 let say 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.960
 we introduce through the center again 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.900
 let say 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.010
 and we started to tighten tight 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.940
 and now we go through one of these two 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.940
 sides for example here 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.860
 we introduce 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.580
 we press hard 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.580
 and now 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.210
 let's catch and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.170
 let's make a knot 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.170
 in this way 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.690
 so that our thread is well secured 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 A) Yes 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.289
 we do again 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.110
 always careful of the needle do not we 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.430
 let's go click 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.430
 to see that I have made a small mess 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.680
 we first tighten the first knot 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.030
 tiny and then on the big one and 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.030
 we press hard 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.639
 and now with the help of scissors 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.370
 let's cut all the excess thread 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:57.310
 Once the thread is cut, we will have 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.310
 our chained booklet 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.169
 and the leaves are no longer separated if 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:10.289
 you want to put a cover of either 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.370
 also of paper or cardboard 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.400
 the same piece of paper 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.650
 we put it like this a little bit more 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.120
 great to give you a little bit 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.699
 we put on top and with it and what 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.680
 we went through the same steps as 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:29.139
 we have done before I hope that I have 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.139
 help hello
