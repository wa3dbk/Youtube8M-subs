00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
and ground operations so what it means

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.740 
and ground operations so what it means
for<00:01:12.289> us<00:01:12.560> now<00:01:12.829> is<00:01:13.130> picking<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.090> few<00:01:14.329> countries

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
for us now is picking a few countries

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.709 
for us now is picking a few countries
where<00:01:15.079> we<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.350> really<00:01:15.649> go<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.390> serve<00:01:17.390> multiple

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
where we can really go in serve multiple

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.289 
where we can really go in serve multiple
cities<00:01:18.259> within<00:01:18.560> those<00:01:18.740> markets<00:01:19.310> multiple

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
cities within those markets multiple

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.270 
cities within those markets multiple
frequencies<00:01:20.899> trying<00:01:21.469> to<00:01:21.619> get<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> double

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
frequencies trying to get to a double

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.950 
frequencies trying to get to a double
daily<00:01:22.429> service<00:01:23.299> which<00:01:23.509> by<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.750> way<00:01:23.869> is

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
daily service which by the way is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.330 
daily service which by the way is
critical<00:01:24.530> when<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.740> think<00:01:24.950> about<00:01:25.009> how

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
critical when you think about how

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.999 
critical when you think about how
important<00:01:25.969> the<00:01:26.390> feeder<00:01:26.689> network<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.350> right<00:01:27.799> so

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
important the feeder network is right so

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.889 
important the feeder network is right so
if<00:01:28.490> you've<00:01:28.700> got<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.240> flight<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> day<00:01:29.569> one

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
if you've got one flight a day one

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.840 
if you've got one flight a day one
flight<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> day<00:01:30.259> inevitably<00:01:31.069> it<00:01:31.280> means<00:01:31.520> an

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
flight a day inevitably it means an

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.639 
flight a day inevitably it means an
overnight<00:01:32.270> stay<00:01:32.539> for<00:01:32.810> one<00:01:32.959> of<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.229> sector's

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
overnight stay for one of the sector's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.859 
overnight stay for one of the sector's
so<00:01:34.310> getting<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.789> double<00:01:35.119> daily<00:01:35.270> service<00:01:35.719> is

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
so getting to a double daily service is

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.179 
so getting to a double daily service is
the<00:01:35.990> ultimate<00:01:36.110> goal<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.950> basically

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
the ultimate goal and that basically

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.910 
the ultimate goal and that basically
means<00:01:37.640> when<00:01:38.209> you<00:01:38.299> look<00:01:38.450> at<00:01:38.569> our<00:01:38.709> future<00:01:39.709> plane

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
means when you look at our future plane

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.779 
means when you look at our future plane
orders<00:01:40.299> we've<00:01:41.299> got<00:01:41.450> focus<00:01:41.720> alright<00:01:42.349> so<00:01:42.789> we've

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
orders we've got focus alright so we've

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.130 
orders we've got focus alright so we've
said<00:01:44.030> look<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.479> know<00:01:44.509> given<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.929> situation

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
said look you know given the situation

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.969 
said look you know given the situation

that<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.880> an<00:02:35.000> option<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.690> japan<00:02:36.470> i<00:02:36.709> think<00:02:37.190> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
that is an option for japan i think but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.040 
that is an option for japan i think but
we'll<00:02:37.610> we'll<00:02:37.990> let<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.260> a320<00:02:40.220> shorthorn<00:02:40.730> water

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
we'll we'll let the a320 shorthorn water

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.020 
we'll we'll let the a320 shorthorn water
itself<00:02:42.050> established<00:02:42.650> first<00:02:42.920> develop<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.880> then

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
itself established first develop in then

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.150 
itself established first develop in then
and<00:02:44.270> then<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.630> look<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.160> it's

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and then we can look at it it's

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.110 
and then we can look at it it's
certainly<00:02:46.400> an<00:02:46.490> option<00:02:46.550> we<00:02:46.880> can<00:02:46.970> also

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
certainly an option we can also

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.000 
certainly an option we can also
potentially<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.840> other<00:02:48.110> bases<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:48.740> barley

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
potentially have other bases like barley

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.660 
potentially have other bases like barley
for<00:02:49.850> example<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:51.440> within<00:02:51.650> these<00:02:52.480> countries

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
for example but within these countries

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.140 
for example but within these countries

may<00:03:53.450> not<00:03:53.510> be<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.959> think<00:03:54.410> one<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.950> challenges

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
may not be I think one of the challenges

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.460 
may not be I think one of the challenges
is<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:56.420> fact<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.079> different

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
is the fact that it is a different

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.880 
is the fact that it is a different
country<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:57.980> it's<00:03:58.130> also<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.610> where

is only with 2010-2011 is the markets
where<00:04:49.479> we<00:04:49.599> have<00:04:49.780> scale<00:04:50.169> we<00:04:50.979> have<00:04:51.070> been<00:04:51.160> able<00:04:51.250> to

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
where we have scale we have been able to

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.270 
where we have scale we have been able to
deliver<00:04:51.729> profitability<00:04:52.300> right<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.650> 2011

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280

for example Australia and China were at
profit<00:04:58.780> margins<00:04:59.199> that<00:04:59.289> were<00:04:59.440> even<00:04:59.560> higher

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
profit margins that were even higher

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.800
