00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.810
 they are regarded as rulers of the seas and yet as humans only a little above themselves 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.930
 the documentary keywords try to change this and thus stands in the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.650
 Tradition of spectacular healing research projects to do something about that 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 Experiencing little known lives of the shy white shark Fabian constructs 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.289
 Custom 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.159
 In the discussion researchers sure custo a submarine called loyal to German Troy 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.469
 four years ago, the team starts building a model that's a real one 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:30.759
 white sharks in size form and look the same 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 Attention is paid to every little detail 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.470
 we are now putting high-resolution cameras in the eye sockets all under glass 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.370
 Koppel we try to make them look as alive as possible using the technology 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 to let exactly who writes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.740
 everything does not have to be 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.460
 also the movements up to 600 kilos Trojan fish 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.170
 the first swim attempts in a pool show the months of work has become 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 worth 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.440
 The postwar period is ready for his first manned deployment in the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 Pacific before only peeps 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 the carport 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.880
 Hentschel 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.190
 The 39-year-old explorer forces his red fish out in his fish costumes 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.650
 Steel should protect against possible attacks of the sharks 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.910
 If the fiberglass head is trapped yesterday, there is no escape 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.120
 more 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.850
 the two cameras in the eyes of the vehicle are the only option 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 for Fabian Gusto to get an idea of ​​his surroundings 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 Om, the submarine is flooded 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.530
 while others do not stay on the Pacific through the blue waters of the Pacific 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 Looking for suitable from Augusto is it with the navigation the dummy 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 employed 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.939
 In addition to running a white shark over 260 hours of footage itself 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.060
 during these explosions, they only went downhill 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.620
 At least I do not know the sharks have their sculptures life situation fast 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 playful like me 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.729
 once again the statistics on average, it comes to 80 to 100 annually 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.630
 hai-attacks do not give much thought to the fact that a large part of it was provoked 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.949
 by carelessness and outlines the human 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.729
 If he asks the question he can do that since Capo Schalkes 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:15.750
 Goal scorer Grote 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.310
 there we should say 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.059
 to deal with the question of why they actually us 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.709
 do not eat forest actually we are yes 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.450
 pretty close judges may be afraid with little energy expenditure could be hotter 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.659
 be of people 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.949
 that does not happen worldwide 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.649
 we heard the prey we are far away from that 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 to intruders in Linz a world 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.669
 and no predator of this world will eat something it does not know 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.319
 and so 10 people very safe even if many sharks are uncontested 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.409
 how many sharks around us are the submarine and the associated 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.340
 Research trip by Gerhard Vigener Damage code Jackie brought important 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.569
 findings 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.789
 The first dive before the 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.089
 South African coast in September 2006 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.889
 225 more will follow 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.779
 the 100,000-euro vehicle intersected several hundred 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.699
 The researchers are looking for square kilometers not only in the water 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.699
 Paris 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.069
 physically 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.309
 and they took off by helicopter this shoreline and 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.089
 Zara lots of small dots 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:31.559
 these are white sharks clearly visible from the shape of the top and still tells 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.019
 three kilometers of coastline 85 kilos 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.729
 the turn was the beach you have to say 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.439
 Of course we went straight with the bow 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.230
 and again to see why are too many animals with large dictate 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.199
 Marcel Barth is relatively small for the animals 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.269
 Metelen 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.809
 30 to mid-50 Asia young hatched and white shark actual few months 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.449
 few weeks old partly 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.679
 that was an unbelievable number and misunderstood curiously though no food in the 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.549
 Water was the animals came to the boat 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.199
 touched us 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.789
 you dare well 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.629
 but that was never done in adult life 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.499
 However, there is never Commerce on this section of the beach future 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.930
 Nevertheless, Emlichheim asked the researchers for silence 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.999
 the question in turn remains especially young animals in Basel 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.130
 at the same time fewer and fewer older specimens exist 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.000
 because man becomes an unprecedented extermination campaign against a living being 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.170
 whose ancestors swam 400 million years ago through the oceans 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.490
 What happens here off the coast of Costa Rica is simply a carnage 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.370
 alive the shark's fins are cut off the mutilated one 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.310
 Animal is then thrown back into the sea where it has long since perished 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.930
 by the way, a violation of anyway salmon protection law 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.059
 100 million sharks meet this fate they honestly associate themselves 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.330
 Overfishing the seas took long lines which is actually another eighth 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.969
 trawls 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.059
 Over the past 50 years, the stock has been decimated by 90 percent 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.509
 the project has really let off steam for what 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.379
 for a bowl of soup 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.050
 that the profit-saving hearing-sense know what 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.240
 In the cellar right so keep between 80 to 100 dollars 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:15.710
 meanwhile 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.350
 between there are also almost only small river Niers no big ones 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.499
 There are problems 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.209
 and that's even sold off as something by the maritime industry 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:26.370
 very special Konstantin Moreth 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.289
 because the super 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.289
 The fact is there are not any big ones anymore 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.309
 This is 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:38.989
 to match the subtitle of Bob Stewart black-and-red when sharks die 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.290
 the dark message of the film the human being is one of the most important 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.290
 Regulators of the Beko system to destroy more 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.439
 they provide health and balance in their environment but only one of 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.800
 Cyprus received in the Atlantic has survived the last six years 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:57.350
 scientific studies prove 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.390
 a coral reef without sharks dies within a year because the plankton eater 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.779
 take over 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.939
 one of many reasons that should lead to it 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.389
 that we humans meet the home with a little more respect and consideration 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.389
 should 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.569
 everything you give us
