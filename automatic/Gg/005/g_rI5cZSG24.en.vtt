00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
beat my first my first like difficult
the<00:00:44.910> video<00:00:45.390> game<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:45.930> Legend<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the video game and it was Legend of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
the video game and it was Legend of
Zelda<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.980> I've<00:00:47.670> played<00:00:48.270> every<00:00:48.539> video<00:00:48.840> game

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Zelda and I've played every video game

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
Zelda and I've played every video game
right<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.190> come<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.370> ever<00:00:50.730> since<00:00:51.000> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
right when they come out ever since like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.660 
right when they come out ever since like
still<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> day<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.070> main<00:00:53.250> character

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
still to this day so the main character

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
still to this day so the main character
has<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.149> triangle<00:00:54.629> tattooed<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.260> his<00:00:55.379> hand

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
has this triangle tattooed on his hand

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
has this triangle tattooed on his hand
so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.980> thought<00:00:56.430> it'd<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.730> pretty<00:00:56.910> appropriate

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so I thought it'd be pretty appropriate

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
so I thought it'd be pretty appropriate
to<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> done<00:00:57.870> how<00:00:58.559> old<00:00:58.710> were<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.280> I

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
first tattoo that I ever got I had some

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.890 
first tattoo that I ever got I had some
friends<00:04:02.680> pass<00:04:03.040> away<00:04:03.340> when<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:03.669> was<00:04:03.819> like<00:04:04.090> 17<00:04:04.510> so

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
friends pass away when I was like 17 so

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.839 
friends pass away when I was like 17 so
I<00:04:04.930> got<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.440> in<00:04:05.709> memory<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.190> them<00:04:06.459> as<00:04:06.639> two

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
I got this in memory of them as two

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.580 
I got this in memory of them as two
girls<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.389> I<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.599> their<00:04:07.720> faces<00:04:08.109> tattooed<00:04:08.470> on

girls so I got their faces tattooed on
me<00:04:08.739> I<00:04:08.950> thought<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.609> was<00:04:09.700> appropriate<00:04:10.329> for<00:04:10.359> a

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
me I thought it was appropriate for a

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.089 
me I thought it was appropriate for a
first<00:04:10.750> tattoo<00:04:11.200> because<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.590> actually<00:04:11.919> meant

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
first tattoo because it actually meant

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.479 
first tattoo because it actually meant
