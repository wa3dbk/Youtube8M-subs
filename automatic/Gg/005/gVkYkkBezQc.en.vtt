00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
check to see what was going on with them
and<00:00:34.340> yeah<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.820> were<00:00:35.910> only<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> few

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and yeah there were only like a few

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
and yeah there were only like a few
sizes<00:00:36.719> left<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> bunch<00:00:37.440> popped<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.920> so
