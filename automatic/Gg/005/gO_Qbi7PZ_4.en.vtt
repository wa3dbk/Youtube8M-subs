00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
mode now it right here i'll focus in on

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.370 
mode now it right here i'll focus in on
this<00:01:09.869> lens<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.210> i'll<00:01:12.210> make<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> lens

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this lens and i'll make it so the lens

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.590 
this lens and i'll make it so the lens
is<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> subject<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:16.439> picture

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
is kind of the subject of this picture

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.370 
is kind of the subject of this picture
and<00:01:18.600> i'll<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> by<00:01:19.409> isolating<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:24.560> okay<00:01:25.640> so

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and i'll do that by isolating it okay so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
and i'll do that by isolating it okay so
right<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> isolated<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> lens

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
right there I kind of isolated the lens

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.740 
right there I kind of isolated the lens
now<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> wanted<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.860> say<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.060> background

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
now if I wanted the say the background

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.020 
now if I wanted the say the background
to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.860> focus<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:36.990> by

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
to be in focus as well I can do that by

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.080 
to be in focus as well I can do that by
raising<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.540> aperture<00:01:40.189> now<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.430> also

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
raising my aperture now that's also

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
raising my aperture now that's also
letting<00:01:42.390> less<00:01:42.780> light<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> lens<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.970> I'm

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
letting less light into the lens so I'm

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240 
letting less light into the lens so I'm
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> make<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.659> changes<00:01:46.250> take

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
going to have to make some changes take

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.240 
going to have to make some changes take
my<00:01:47.399> iso<00:01:48.000> may<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.159> say<00:01:50.240> 3200<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.250> make

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
my iso may be up to say 3200 and make

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.499 
my iso may be up to say 3200 and make
the<00:01:53.430> shutter<00:01:53.670> speed<00:01:54.030> longer<00:01:54.710> check<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.890> my

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
the shutter speed longer check out my

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.550 
the shutter speed longer check out my
light<00:01:57.509> meter<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:59.540> that's<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> exact<00:02:01.229> same

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
light meter and that's the exact same

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
light meter and that's the exact same
exposure<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:05.189> had<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> last<00:02:06.360> shot

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
exposure as I had in the last shot

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.550 
exposure as I had in the last shot
there's<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.920> first<00:02:08.129> shot<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.259> there<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
there's the first shot and there is the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.480

shot I just took

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.010 
shot I just took
they're<00:02:13.420> exposed<00:02:14.140> exactly<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.220> same<00:02:15.550> but

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
they're exposed exactly the same but

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.470 
they're exposed exactly the same but
once<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.170> get<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.410> manual<00:02:17.950> mode<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:19.450> can

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
once you get in manual mode you can

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.830 
once you get in manual mode you can
drastically<00:02:20.380> change<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.370> look<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.600> picture

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
drastically change the look of a picture

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.920 
drastically change the look of a picture
this<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.970> changing<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.330> depth<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.810> field<00:02:27.930> big

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930

reads exactly the same as it did when

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.210 
reads exactly the same as it did when

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
computer and look at the noise levels

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.770 
computer and look at the noise levels
look<00:04:20.530> what's<00:04:20.739> acceptable<00:04:21.549> from<00:04:22.210> your

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
look what's acceptable from your

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.920 
look what's acceptable from your
specific<00:04:23.710> camera<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:24.760> different<00:04:25.480> cameras

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
specific camera all different cameras

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.900 
specific camera all different cameras
have<00:04:26.320> different<00:04:26.710> sensors<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.520> everything

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
have different sensors and everything

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.800 
have different sensors and everything
and<00:04:28.090> they're<00:04:28.600> going<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.780> be<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> little<00:04:30.160> bit

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and they're going to be a little bit

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.420 
and they're going to be a little bit
different<00:04:31.810> from<00:04:31.900> one<00:04:32.110> another<00:04:32.160> it's<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.280> good

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
different from one another it's a good

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.070 
different from one another it's a good
way<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.610> find<00:04:33.970> out<00:04:34.120> what<00:04:34.390> your<00:04:34.570> camera<00:04:35.020> is
