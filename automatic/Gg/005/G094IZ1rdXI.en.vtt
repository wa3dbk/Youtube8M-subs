00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.850
 the staff wanted to show you a 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:19.340
 second game 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:22.900
 hence the next this game will be the 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.270
 continuation of the lokon plane between the two 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.849
 so in the game it's free 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.599
 Can you help us really? 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.410
 baby or search just went down on google that 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:47.859
 he will show he conditioned two bombs 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:51.289
 to earn funk's soul and a tricky 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.550
 pilot because they had no physical 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.660
 his is very good 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.300
 all other modules are paid 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.140
 then you have a module after it the most 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:09.680
 known is the m3 virtually all 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:13.250
 of the game and then 50 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.990
 Russian helicopter also this game with 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.119
 50 I think a very good game I think it is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.469
 the best of the worlds deficit of this game 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.390
 whole in a fight give and it's to 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:31.329
 You control the tank to tank 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.950
 think and such 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.479
 then there is a mister p 51d that is 11 day 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.799
 of the Second World War 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.820
 it is very difficult to drive and one of the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.759
 their last moves is oh 1h or 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.509
 here in Brazil continues with a flow and 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.880
 It's also tricky to drive one is 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.240
 because you do not have them one to ten 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.759
 down because an airplane you do not like does not 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.100
 likes market so he does not understand the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.300
 staff says it's very good because everything 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.480
 his pit is applicable then all 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.650
 switches that you add only 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.160
 click here 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 it works 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.990
 so here at a destination we have a technician 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 which is to choose one to make a 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.270
 then depending brief mention to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.770
 rossi has displayed 33 34 57 71 that 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.990
 session of the organ falls and 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.790
 so it goes 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:47.790
 After that, you have credit. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:54.080
 creates a new bp rap axle even if you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.510
 want to do in training that the next item 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.500
 is the training is a bit tricky because it is 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:10.380
 not all have training type 1 25 it 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 have none of the videos on youtube 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.610
 then you have the missions you could be 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:24.510
 you create one of the options there you can 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.530
 choose one for campaigns by 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.290
 modules 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.950
 at first everyone has a campaign 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.540
 only you can download others also a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.650
 The Sun's website taught him player whether 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:47.870
 you want it 's all a one battle one 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.870
 thing you've saved from tracking 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:04:00.060
 produce b where you roll a situation and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.220
 such as opening another program that is the game 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.000
 on the internet 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.030
 michelle tour is for you to do 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.470
 mission with you I want you can insert 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.500
 aircraft and helicopters tank ships 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.790
 ok bridges you can create a mission 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.180
 in every area that dodo 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.759
 second, then all 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.759
 the airports and such that the next 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.850
 after 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:53.280
 after the mission the visit has 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.820
 bell to campaign you will make of 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.270
 of various missions then you can 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:06.780
 put here that after a certain 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:12.270
 mission than any other then the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.760
 next encyclopedia template 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.450
 what do you think all information about 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.280
 the helicopter alliances ships to 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.650
 vehicles over the 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.170
 details about the buildings are 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:33.240
 all that's inside the game 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:39.750
 you can find information about it and 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:44.060
 then you have the options and then we options 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:48.390
 what I think most important 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.100
 here is multi question if you have a 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.760
 good multiplayer game viewing you 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.660
 puts everything under the servers in the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.390
 attic where he then knows how to catch his goal 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.400
 in the multiplayer game I put one in 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:08.120
 down more 153 put everything on top of us 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.120
 controls 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:21.060
 here you choose which one 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:27.840
 what you want is to have the 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:31.140
 control of one's own co-operation 27 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.760
 it shows the keyboard and a joystick that 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.770
 you have and a mouse 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:43.580
 what is most important of all is 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:43.580
 sr recommended psf comedy 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.699
 what 's important sometimes is a brunch 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.840
 that he is very sensitive 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.740
 You go in there is a taste for a 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.129
 curve 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:04.629
 then you can set a fourth zone 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:09.490
 is him not not move at all in the game 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:11.770
 Like if you go, I call it an agreement. 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:19.479
 thing in the northwest that he will not touch 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:24.419
 nothing in the game and the dark curves 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:27.460
 normative personnel has put in 2013 33 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:30.699
 helicopter and puts a bigger 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:35.699
 It is the airplane that puts the smallest is but it is rare 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.699
 see someone leave it the way it is 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.340
 I think this is for this first video. 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.750
 I think this has a basic explanation 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:49.930
 about the dcs I'm going to start making a 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:54.880
 Russian aircraft tutorials on the 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:58.900
 helicopter if you have any questions 

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.810
 about some deficit may comment that I 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:06.719
 I'll do the answer dijon. 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.719
 It's close then until the next
