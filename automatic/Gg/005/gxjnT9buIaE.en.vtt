00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
I think it's an aggressive way of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.900 
I think it's an aggressive way of
putting<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.590> nope<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:47.490> one's<00:02:47.610> ever<00:02:47.760> put

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.590 
putting it here nope no one's ever put

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
mesh almost cloth material up front but

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.140 
mesh almost cloth material up front but
you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.020> does<00:02:52.230> its<00:02:52.440> part<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:53.400> looks<00:02:53.820> good

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
