the running boards I converted this to
electric<00:02:17.310> start<00:02:17.670> because<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.810> wasn't

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
electric start because I just wasn't

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.860 
electric start because I just wasn't
into<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.410> whole<00:02:19.500> kicking<00:02:20.010> thing<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.720> know<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
into the whole kicking thing you know I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.300 
into the whole kicking thing you know I
tried<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.069> just

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
tried it for a little bit it was just

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
tried it for a little bit it was just
too<00:02:23.489> much<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.910> was<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.299> bit<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.540> work<00:02:24.660> had

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
too much it was a little bit of work had

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.020 
too much it was a little bit of work had
to<00:02:24.989> make<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> custom<00:02:25.620> pulley<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> front

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
to make a custom pulley for the front

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
to make a custom pulley for the front
because<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.720> make<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> kit<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.470> this

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
because they don't make a kit for this

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.380 
because they don't make a kit for this
particular<00:02:29.670> bike<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.760> did<00:02:32.970> I'd<00:02:33.209> have

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
particular bike and if they did I'd have

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.590 
particular bike and if they did I'd have
to<00:02:33.600> order<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.130> replace<00:02:35.700> order<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.269> replace

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to order and replace order and replace

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.360 
to order and replace order and replace
and<00:02:36.989> or<00:02:37.170> maybe<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.709> lucky<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.069> first<00:02:38.220> time

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and or maybe I get lucky the first time

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.600 
and or maybe I get lucky the first time
and<00:02:38.640> get<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> right<00:02:39.030> pulley<00:02:39.299> but<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and get the right pulley but as it is I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.960 
and get the right pulley but as it is I
decided<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.060> make<00:02:42.209> my<00:02:42.390> own<00:02:43.580> nice<00:02:44.580> having<00:02:44.910> a
