00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
ringer it for anything plenty of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.030 
ringer it for anything plenty of
opportunity<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.330> other<00:03:15.660> programs<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.530> build

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
opportunity for other programs to build

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.850

around<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.690> know<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.410> know<00:03:19.530> it's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
around this and you know you know it's

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.790 
around this and you know you know it's
ultimately<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.880> throwaway<00:03:21.360> match<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.140> think

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
ultimately a throwaway match but I think

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.100 
ultimately a throwaway match but I think
this<00:03:22.950> may<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.670> match<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.600> actually<00:03:24.810> do

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
this may be a match that I actually do

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.000
