original model what do you think it's

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.880 
original model what do you think it's
worth<00:01:34.590> an<00:01:35.590> auction<00:01:36.250> I'd<00:01:36.400> probably<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:37.120> around

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
worth an auction I'd probably be around

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.750 
worth an auction I'd probably be around
I'd<00:01:38.890> say<00:01:39.400> maybe<00:01:40.000> 400<00:01:41.010> at<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.190> right<00:01:42.370> auction

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
I'd say maybe 400 at the right auction

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.080 
I'd say maybe 400 at the right auction
it<00:01:42.880> does<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.330> original<00:01:43.900> stand<00:01:44.200> here<00:01:44.470> so<00:01:44.770> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it does have original stand here so I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.840 
it does have original stand here so I
mean<00:01:46.090> maybe<00:01:46.450> five<00:01:46.870> at<00:01:47.110> most<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.490> kind<00:01:48.729> of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
mean maybe five at most but it's kind of

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.140 
mean maybe five at most but it's kind of
hard<00:01:48.909> with<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> economy

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150
