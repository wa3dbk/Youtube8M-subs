00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:17.063
This is the location where we are going to launch our balloon. At first we will set up the Helium-Can. A pressure reducer allows us to fill the balloon with Helium.

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:28.664
Please mind that the fastener has to be pulled out completely. In that case the pressure reducer is locked.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:32.063
Afterwards you can open the can by turning this.

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:38.913
There is an easy test to find out it you are really using Helium ;)

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:48.286
Our parachute will be attached with a longer string (10m) with the box. 

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:54.833
. If the parachute lands in a tree it might happen that the box will fall down to the ground and you dont have to climb up the tree.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.706
A shorter string (5m) will be attached to the balloon.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:11.826
For inflating the balloon you have to insert the pipe through the valve. 

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:20.631
While the balloon is inflating we will check the cameras. The camera is running and we fix the camera in the capsule.

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:33.771
Afterwards you have to close the capsule and close the gaps with the duct tape.

00:01:42.305 --> 00:02:00.357
The balloon has a special skin but you can remove it to save some weight. When you pull out the pipe you can close the valve by pulling at the little string.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:07.566
Now we attach the parachute at our balloon.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.849
Okay, then lets start this shit!

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:43.525
As you can see the balloon goes straight up. Now the balloon needs 2 hours on his journey up to 20 miles.
