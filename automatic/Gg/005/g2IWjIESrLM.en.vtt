00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.220 
because I'm not perfect at eyeliner it's
kind<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:23.360> much<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.600> elf<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.960> have

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
kind of so much of the elf one I have

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.610 
kind of so much of the elf one I have
but<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.250> thing<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.000> elf<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:27.260> $2

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
but the thing is is that elf is like $2

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.300 
but the thing is is that elf is like $2
so<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.450> $15<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:30.770> not<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
so this is like $15 so that's not so

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.940 
so this is like $15 so that's not so
great<00:02:31.490> now<00:02:32.270> I'm<00:02:32.420> going<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.350> exfoliator

great now I'm going to do the exfoliator

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.290 
great now I'm going to do the exfoliator
I<00:02:34.250> had<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> stings<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.540> stings<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:39.940> basically<00:02:40.940> I

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
I had it stings it stings so basically I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.030 
I had it stings it stings so basically I
don't<00:02:41.540> always<00:02:41.810> think<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.170> did<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.500> much<00:02:42.560> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
don't always think it did that much I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.860 
don't always think it did that much I
put<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.610> my<00:02:43.790> lips<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.209> then<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> wash<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.660> off

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
put it on my lips and then I wash it off

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.960 
put it on my lips and then I wash it off
I<00:02:45.110> think<00:02:45.500> that's<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.520> could<00:02:46.820> be

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
I think that's what you do I could be

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.760 
I think that's what you do I could be
wrong<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.510> my<00:02:47.690> lips<00:02:47.900> look<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.320> same<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
wrong like my lips look the same and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.160 
wrong like my lips look the same and
feel<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.430> same<00:02:49.670> from<00:02:50.120> before<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.510> did<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.140> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
feel the same from before I did it so I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.170 
feel the same from before I did it so I
just<00:02:51.230> put<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.770> vitamin<00:02:52.190> E<00:02:52.340> stick<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.910> it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
just put on the vitamin E stick and it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.300 
just put on the vitamin E stick and it
feels<00:02:53.360> really<00:02:53.450> nice<00:02:53.690> feel<00:02:54.050> like<00:02:54.230> AOS<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:55.010> you

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.119 
cropped the thing is is that they have

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.540 
cropped the thing is is that they have
like<00:06:50.269> little<00:06:50.479> stitches<00:06:51.469> in<00:06:51.619> them<00:06:51.800> so<00:06:52.219> that<00:06:52.399> if

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
like little stitches in them so that if

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.619 
like little stitches in them so that if
you<00:06:52.639> want<00:06:52.819> to<00:06:52.909> make<00:06:53.029> them<00:06:53.149> shorter<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:53.509> can

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:53.629 
you want to make them shorter you can

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.389 
you want to make them shorter you can
actually<00:06:53.779> cut<00:06:54.169> them<00:06:54.349> which<00:06:54.559> is<00:06:54.649> really<00:06:54.949> cool<00:06:55.129> I

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
actually cut them which is really cool I

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.829 
actually cut them which is really cool I
think<00:06:55.579> that's<00:06:55.849> such<00:06:55.999> a<00:06:56.029> nice<00:06:56.179> idea<00:06:56.329> because<00:06:56.749> it

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:56.839 
think that's such a nice idea because it

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.600 
think that's such a nice idea because it
makes<00:06:56.989> it<00:06:57.079> to<00:06:57.169> be<00:06:57.259> the<00:06:57.349> straight<00:06:57.559> line<00:06:57.739> I<00:06:58.009> think

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
makes it to be the straight line I think

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.069 
makes it to be the straight line I think
that's<00:06:58.759> so<00:06:58.909> cool<00:06:59.059> so<00:06:59.209> I<00:06:59.239> might<00:06:59.449> cut<00:06:59.659> mine<00:06:59.869> if<00:07:00.019> I

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.079 
that's so cool so I might cut mine if I

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.569 
that's so cool so I might cut mine if I
want<00:07:00.229> them<00:07:00.319> shorter<00:07:00.649> but<00:07:01.189> I'm<00:07:01.309> not<00:07:01.459> really

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:01.579
