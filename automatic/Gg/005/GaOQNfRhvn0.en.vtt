was actually going into the zone as I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.350 
was actually going into the zone as I
only<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.199> say<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.010> no<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.430> murasakibara

could<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:57.989> into<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> zone<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.770> he

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
could go into the zone because he

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
could go into the zone because he
doesn't<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> love<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.520> basketball<00:00:59.850> he<00:01:00.359> is

doesn't have a love for basketball he is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.910 
doesn't have a love for basketball he is
like<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.079> doesn't<00:01:01.379> care<00:01:01.559> through<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.800> like

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
like just doesn't care through it like

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.549 
like just doesn't care through it like
that<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> guy<00:01:03.719> did<00:01:03.780> he<00:01:04.199> acts<00:01:04.409> he

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that but for what the guy did he acts he

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
that but for what the guy did he acts he
went<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> zone<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> makes<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.270> think

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
went into the zone and it makes me think

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.500 
went into the zone and it makes me think
maybe<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.860> maybe<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.400> since<00:01:08.939> he<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.330> look

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
maybe just maybe like since he does look

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
maybe just maybe like since he does look
like<00:01:09.659> he<00:01:09.840> does<00:01:10.170> care<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> sport<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.189> I'm

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like he does care for the sport but I'm

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.980 
like he does care for the sport but I'm
guessing<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> could<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.630> possibly

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
guessing as well it could be possibly

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
guessing as well it could be possibly
that<00:01:13.170> some<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:13.740> forcibly<00:01:14.250> like

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that some people could forcibly like

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
that some people could forcibly like
actually<00:01:15.659> activate<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> zone<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.369> still

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
actually activate the zone like I still

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
actually activate the zone like I still
don't<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
don't know really too much about the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't know really too much about the
zone<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> still<00:01:19.530> needs<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> third

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
zone it still needs to be the third

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.679 
zone it still needs to be the third
