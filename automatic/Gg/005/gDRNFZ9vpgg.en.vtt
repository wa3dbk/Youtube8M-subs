00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.170
 Former country teacher is good diagnostic imaging promoter Ichiro 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.910
 tob primovist third dynamics method 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.889
 about 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.639
 But I will inject agents and contrast agents 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.039
 Speed ​​imaging timing saline / etc 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.140
 I will talk about 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.599
 This time in the timeline of the dynamics and so on 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.880
 It is this part We talk about timing of arterial transportation 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.920
 To do 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.350
 The problem with this contrast agent is that it has much more material 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.680
 And the point 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.180
 It can be said that the increase effect can be confirmed theoretically 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.390
 It means that there is only 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.700
 As a way to solve it 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.490
 Injection of contrast agent 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.840
 Determine the appropriate time to start the war 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.150
 Although there is this improvement measures such as fresh saline additional administration 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 In nri, the data is in the space that Shiro Sema can freely 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.270
 When collecting 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.280
 Relatively and timing is 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 Not the middle of the circular space 1. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 Relatively shutter speed 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 It is said that it is somewhat long 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.430
 It's about 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.610
 Mr. Ichikawa 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 It was injecting before mass production 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.399
 It is almost clear if you clear around 25 seconds of the space absolutely 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.510
 Hit 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 It has been said that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.979
 There are still statues 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.300
 That considerable sum plus 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.770
 But the other day equipment 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.450
 It was said that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 I am inspired by 14 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 It is mandatory for regular staff 1000suica and Manohama 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.280
 The remainder is a constitution that increases to subclavian vein thrombosis, so that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 I have to push it out at once 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 Add saline and pile up 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.340
 The total amount of sound is large and 30 carascos 10 cc recommended 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.230
 It has been 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.580
 We use 50cc 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 I am 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:12.889
 Well 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.549
 An example is shown for a patient weighing 69 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.859
 The total amount of contrast media is fifty-one 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.469
 It will be said 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.469
 Oh yes injection amount is 56 ml 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.189
 It has become 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.669
 Injection with Sammy Bundle 2nd injection rate and contrast agent is available to 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:40.040
 It will be injected and it will add up to 17 seconds of raw curiosity income. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.329
 Fore-phase injection speed 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 Two hours in the middle will be 19 seconds 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.819
 ct more and more theories are called out, but 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.469
 It's about getting to Oita from haste 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.329
 Also about this matter, Dr. Ichikawa still study stage 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.449
 So I was not told it though 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.729
 When I featured a master of theory in old paper camouflage 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.899
 I decided to inject a loan contrast agent 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.949
 The result of examining yeah at 345 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.999
 It is said that the second leading to the line will be the largest first 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.639
 It is said that the way is seen as a result 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.889
 It was about 30 seconds in about 2 hours of the optimum medium that was Mitsubishi from there 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.969
 The decision is being made while the wind is increasing 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.240
 It is said that we will go 12 times 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.240
 If you just do it regardless of your weight 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 Imaging central time after coronary artery delivery 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:43.319
 When 45 seconds of 36 + 15 seconds of income time are put, it becomes the center axis 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.989
 That's the theory 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.989
 It is only area use increase 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.379
 But I'm believing in the book shot, but the concentration 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.209
 Contrast agent 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.309
 Plus is faster injection 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.499
 More than during high concentration contrast agent + measurement 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.459
 The paper shows that the degree of brain washing in the aorta was strong. 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.199
 It is quoted 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.029
 So make it thinner 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.489
 You should be in restraint 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.159
 The result of saying has come out 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.190
 Apply from there and pass the arrangement of the attendees almost 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.229
 Consider 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.520
 Do not start additional contrast agent plus contrast agent total volume + saline 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.270
 In addition saline 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.580
 I will emphasize and add in the future 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.240
 That's the way 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.650
 Imagination atonement 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 I want to dilute the positive growth pace 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.599
 Though this monk is 45-6 days a day 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.999
 Besides that saline like suica 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.020
 I'm doing what I say, I will consider these two 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.229
 How do you decide the timing of the police etc. 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.129
 Say 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.690
 Another teacher said 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.309
 Aortic arrival time 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.939
 Just a few tens of seconds from the same start of imaging 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.789
 In the case of the previous battle and the recorder, it is so 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.999
 half of the time 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.990
 It is something that I pulled from this time 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.240
 From the British aorta arrival time plus 10 seconds 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.240
 Whole volume 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.259
 One half of the imaging time minus the imaging start 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.759
 It will be said that this year so much 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.410
 is 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.969
 University suffocation suffocation 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.029
 I'm trying to do this and inject a little contrast agent 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.710
 How long have you been standing up? 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.599
 Measure the actual value and subtract it by 10 seconds 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.189
 It was Dokita because it was half of the time to invite the former department 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.169
 Examine these two types of imaging methods using imaging timing 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.379
 I'm doing 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.979
 It is over high 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:47.879
 Thank you very much
