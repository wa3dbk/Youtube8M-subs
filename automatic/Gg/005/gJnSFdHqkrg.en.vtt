lessons<00:00:02.700> botnet<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.540> want<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.350> show<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:05.069> to

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
lessons botnet I want to show you how to

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.190 
lessons botnet I want to show you how to
get<00:00:05.339> more<00:00:05.609> topspin<00:00:06.299> out<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.470> your<00:00:07.589> string<00:00:07.950> jobs

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
get more topspin out of your string jobs

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.490 
get more topspin out of your string jobs
a<00:00:10.200> lot<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.280> people<00:00:11.580> today<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.910> using

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
a lot of people today are using

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.330 
a lot of people today are using
polyester<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.780> they<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.130> at

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
polyester to do that and they do that at

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.990 
polyester to do that and they do that at
the<00:00:17.490> risk<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.910> putting<00:00:18.630> their<00:00:18.869> arm<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:20.430> would

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the risk of putting their arm I would

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
the risk of putting their arm I would
rather<00:00:21.350> see<00:00:22.350> people<00:00:22.529> use<00:00:23.750> regular<00:00:24.750> synthetic

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
rather see people use regular synthetic

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
rather see people use regular synthetic
and<00:00:26.210> put<00:00:27.210> strings<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> their<00:00:28.230> rackets<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:29.609> if

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and put strings in their rackets now if

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.470 
and put strings in their rackets now if
you<00:00:29.820> put<00:00:30.060> strings<00:00:33.860> this<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.420> calling<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you put strings this is a calling of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.770 
you put strings this is a calling of
string<00:00:36.809> lengths<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> call<00:00:39.480> them<00:00:39.600> all

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
string lengths but you can call them all

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
string lengths but you can call them all
sorts<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> things<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.129> by<00:00:41.280> Babolat

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
sorts of things this is one by Babolat

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.930 
sorts of things this is one by Babolat
you<00:00:42.600> put<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you put it in there like that and you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
you put it in there like that and you
push<00:00:45.710> they<00:00:46.710> aren't<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.379> leave<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
push they aren't that and leave one in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.630 
push they aren't that and leave one in
there<00:00:50.489> okay<00:00:51.210> easy<00:00:52.170> call<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> last<00:00:52.890> across

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there okay easy call it last across

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
there okay easy call it last across
there's<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.629> string<00:00:55.110> savers<00:00:55.559> they're<00:00:56.280> all

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's also string savers they're all

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
there's also string savers they're all
the<00:00:56.520> same<00:00:56.550> thing<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the same thing they go on the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.490 
the same thing they go on the
intersection<00:00:59.250> between<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.699> strings<00:01:00.500> this

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
intersection between the strings this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
intersection between the strings this
one<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.670> pattern<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.739> every<00:01:05.840> other<00:01:06.840> string<00:01:08.060> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
one the pattern is every other string so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.389 
one the pattern is every other string so
that<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.770> one<00:01:10.770> left<00:01:11.130> without

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.940 

the<00:01:14.969> I<00:01:15.299> hope<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:16.920> are

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the I hope you can see where they are

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.480 
the I hope you can see where they are
and<00:01:17.369> where<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:18.469> now<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.009> pattern

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and where they are not now that pattern

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.840 
and where they are not now that pattern
will<00:01:20.789> produce<00:01:20.969> more<00:01:21.390> spin<00:01:21.750> than<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:23.369> leaving

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
will produce more spin than just leaving

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.959 
will produce more spin than just leaving
the<00:01:24.659> strings<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.439> touch<00:01:26.399> each<00:01:26.579> other<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:28.969> better

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
the strings to touch each other a better

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.859 
the strings to touch each other a better
way<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.810 

I<00:01:36.640> have<00:01:37.640> colored<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.299> string<00:01:38.630> dark<00:01:39.820> against

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
I have colored the string dark against

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.649 
I have colored the string dark against
this<00:01:41.119> white<00:01:41.630> background<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:43.299> if<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:44.420> put

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
this white background and if you put

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.630 
this white background and if you put
string<00:01:45.409> Ling's<00:01:45.619> along<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> black<00:01:46.400> area<00:01:48.640> and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
string Ling's along the black area and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.590 
string Ling's along the black area and
leave<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.030> rest<00:01:50.180> open<00:01:52.869> you'll<00:01:53.869> get<00:01:54.110> more<00:01:54.320> spin

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
leave the rest open you'll get more spin

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.170 
leave the rest open you'll get more spin
put<00:01:56.600> them<00:01:56.720> in<00:01:56.810> every<00:01:57.110> intersection<00:01:58.070> along<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
put them in every intersection along the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.800 
put them in every intersection along the
line<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:01.850> will<00:02:01.970> sort<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.420> give<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
line it will sort of like give you a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
line it will sort of like give you a
razor's<00:02:03.320> edge<00:02:03.500> against<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.369> ball

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270 

now<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:09.569> another<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.099> I'm<00:02:11.099> not

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
now there's another way that I'm not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
now there's another way that I'm not
going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> show<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.569> will<00:02:12.720> take

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
going to show you because it will take

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.850 
going to show you because it will take
you<00:02:13.110> may<00:02:13.769> 33<00:02:14.760> minutes<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.849> a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
you may 33 minutes to do it but it's a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
you may 33 minutes to do it but it's a
an<00:02:19.970> idea<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.239> blending<00:02:22.040> polyester<00:02:23.690> with

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
an idea of blending polyester with

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.030 
an idea of blending polyester with
synthetic<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.299> quite<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.870> part<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
synthetic it's not quite as part of the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
synthetic it's not quite as part of the
arm<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.580> all<00:02:30.239> polyester<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:33.690> what

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
arm as all polyester it's not what

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.920 
arm as all polyester it's not what
normally<00:02:35.220> people<00:02:35.459> think<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> polyester

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
normally people think of as a polyester

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.190 
normally people think of as a polyester
blend<00:02:38.060> polyester<00:02:39.060> blend<00:02:39.360> normally<00:02:39.930> is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
blend polyester blend normally is

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
blend polyester blend normally is
polyester<00:02:40.739> other<00:02:41.069> veins<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.079> synthetic<00:02:43.079> or

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
polyester other veins and synthetic or

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.940 
polyester other veins and synthetic or
gut<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> crosses<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.709> suggesting

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
gut on the crosses what I'm suggesting

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.750 
gut on the crosses what I'm suggesting
is<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.970> stream<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> racket<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is that you stream the racket so that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110 
is that you stream the racket so that
every<00:02:51.299> other<00:02:51.510> stream<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.980> synthetic<00:02:53.370> for

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
every other stream is synthetic for

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.160 
every other stream is synthetic for
every<00:02:54.540> other<00:02:54.720> string<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.950> polyester<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.930> it's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
every other string is polyester so it's

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.360 
every other string is polyester so it's
poly<00:02:59.090> synthetic<00:03:00.110> polysynthetic<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.190> do

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
poly synthetic polysynthetic and you do

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.449 
poly synthetic polysynthetic and you do
that<00:03:02.549> same<00:03:02.940> thing<00:03:02.970> on<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.390> crosses<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.459> that

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
that same thing on the crosses and that
