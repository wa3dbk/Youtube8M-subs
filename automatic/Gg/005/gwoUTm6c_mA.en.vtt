learning<00:00:30.420> back<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.949> huge<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.340> know

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
learning back I think it's huge you know

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
learning back I think it's huge you know
you<00:00:32.520> take<00:00:33.090> shots<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.750> every<00:00:33.960> different

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you take shots from every different

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.520 
you take shots from every different
angle

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
angle

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.620 
angle
it's<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> running<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.120> extremely

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's as a running back it's extremely

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
it's as a running back it's extremely
unpredictable<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> don't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
unpredictable you know you don't

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.959 
unpredictable you know you don't
necessarily<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.540> everybody<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> be

I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.820> great<00:00:48.329> balance<00:00:48.660> makes<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> know

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I think great balance makes you know

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.200 
I think great balance makes you know
running<00:00:49.379> backs<00:00:49.530> great<00:00:54.469> what<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> key<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
running backs great what is the key to

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
running backs great what is the key to
absorbing<00:00:57.210> hits<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> staying<00:00:58.020> upright<00:00:58.350> you
