I<00:02:11.510> came<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> small<00:02:13.020> link<00:02:13.230> i<00:02:13.380> think<00:02:13.590> i'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I came with a small link i think i'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.990 
I came with a small link i think i'm
going<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.860> take<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> small<00:02:14.400> egg<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.880> see

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
going to take the small egg out and see

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240 
going to take the small egg out and see
if<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> fits<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:15.540> bit<00:02:15.750> better<00:02:16.040> as<00:02:17.040> you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
if that fits a little bit better as you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.620 
if that fits a little bit better as you
can<00:02:17.340> see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
can see

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.990 
can see
put<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.100> there's<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> little<00:02:20.430> bit<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
put it on there's a little bit of a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.660 
put it on there's a little bit of a
little<00:02:24.540> bit<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> looseness<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:26.220> think<00:02:26.610> I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
little bit of looseness and I think I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.530 
little bit of looseness and I think I
want<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> little<00:02:26.970> bit<00:02:27.120> tighter<00:02:27.300> than<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
want a little bit tighter than that so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.760 
want a little bit tighter than that so
you<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:33.960> there's<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.440> bit<00:02:34.710> of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
you can see there's a little bit of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.830 
you can see there's a little bit of
looseness<00:02:35.040> their<00:02:35.490> slides<00:02:36.450> around<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.750> my

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
looseness their slides around on my

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120 
looseness their slides around on my
wrist<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.110> little<00:02:37.170> too<00:02:37.410> much<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.770> I'll<00:02:37.860> take<00:02:38.010> out

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
wrist a little too much so I'll take out

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.710 
wrist a little too much so I'll take out
that<00:02:38.250> small<00:02:38.550> link<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.880> see<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> large<00:02:39.420> as

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that small link and see if the large as

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.350 
that small link and see if the large as
measured<00:02:40.530> fits<00:02:40.770> me<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.160> said<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> came<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.330> a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
measured fits me I said it came with a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.560 
measured fits me I said it came with a
small<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.960> there<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.790> band<00:02:45.000> itself<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
small in there in the band itself and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.760 
small in there in the band itself and
then<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> comes<00:02:45.900> with<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.110> large<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> box

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
then it comes with a large in the box

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.770 
then it comes with a large in the box
but<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:47.280> uh<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.300> little<00:02:48.360> bit<00:02:48.570> too<00:02:48.660> big

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
but that's uh it's a little bit too big

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
but that's uh it's a little bit too big
for<00:02:48.990> me<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.170> let's<00:02:49.230> see<00:02:49.500> what<00:02:49.650> happens<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.160> just

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
for me so let's see what happens we just

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
for me so let's see what happens we just
take<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.060> simple<00:02:51.270> tool<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.870> put<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
take this simple tool we put it in the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.790 
take this simple tool we put it in the
hole<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:54.450> simply<00:02:54.750> releases<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.560> link

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
hole and it simply releases the link

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.850 
hole and it simply releases the link
then<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.640> pull<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.270> then<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:58.260> also<00:02:58.410> can

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
then we pull it out and then we also can

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.470 
then we pull it out and then we also can
separate<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.730> one<00:02:59.910> because<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.150> need<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
separate this one because we need the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.010 
separate this one because we need the
metal<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.960> here<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.240> or<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> USB

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
metal one here for that's the or the USB

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.670 
metal one here for that's the or the USB
port<00:03:04.320> goes<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.160> simply<00:03:06.590> put<00:03:07.590> it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
port goes and then you simply put it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.620 
port goes and then you simply put it
back<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.980> there<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.460> there<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:09.150> simple

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
back in there and there we go as simple

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.900 
back in there and there we go as simple
as<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.140> adjust<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.920> links<00:03:11.280> very<00:03:11.640> quick

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
as that to adjust the links very quick

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.180 
as that to adjust the links very quick

rubber<00:04:06.390> base<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:07.010> use<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.160> dock<00:04:08.370> most<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.180> time

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
rubber base I use the dock most of time

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.030 
rubber base I use the dock most of time
and<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.720> use<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.020> dock<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.620> charge<00:04:10.860> it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
and I use the dock actually to charge it

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.360 
and I use the dock actually to charge it
via<00:04:11.810> USB<00:04:12.810> cable<00:04:13.740> rather<00:04:13.950> than<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.250> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
via USB cable rather than just a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.010 
via USB cable rather than just a
computer<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.850> get<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.060> charged<00:04:15.330> or<00:04:15.480> faster<00:04:15.900> on

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
computer to get it charged or faster on

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.110 
computer to get it charged or faster on
the<00:04:16.140> back<00:04:16.320> there's<00:04:17.130> some<00:04:17.370> screws<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.970> things

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
the back there's some screws and things

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.190 
the back there's some screws and things
like<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.270> and<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.690> guess<00:04:18.840> that's<00:04:18.930> where<00:04:19.140> all

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
like that and I guess that's where all

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.360 
like that and I guess that's where all
the<00:04:19.230> internals<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:19.920> if<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.100> needed<00:04:20.340> to

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
the internals are at if you needed to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.300 
the internals are at if you needed to
have<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:21.020> worked<00:04:22.020> on<00:04:22.200> or<00:04:22.380> whatever<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:23.130> very

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
have it worked on or whatever it's very

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.860 
have it worked on or whatever it's very
comfortable<00:04:23.700> band<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.270> all<00:04:24.420> covered<00:04:24.690> in

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
comfortable band it's all covered in

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.900 
comfortable band it's all covered in
soft<00:04:25.110> touch<00:04:25.410> kind<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.710> rubber<00:04:25.860> stuff<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.760> I'm

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
soft touch kind of rubber stuff and I'm

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.700 
soft touch kind of rubber stuff and I'm
the<00:04:27.270> big<00:04:27.419> deal<00:04:27.600> about<00:04:27.630> this<00:04:27.870> band<00:04:28.200> really<00:04:28.590> is

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
the big deal about this band really is

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.980 
the big deal about this band really is
the<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.400> functions<00:04:29.820> right<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:30.960> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
the the functions right so you have a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.970 
the the functions right so you have a
button<00:04:31.410> here

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
button here

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.460 
button here
you<00:04:32.070> press<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.660> it'll<00:04:33.660> tell<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.960> there's<00:04:34.290> the

you press it it'll tell you there's the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.610 
you press it it'll tell you there's the
time<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.100> then<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:36.030> has<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:36.480> ear<00:04:36.870> fuel<00:04:37.200> right

as a countdown of the fuel up to
Greenwich<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.460> goal<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.970> goal<00:04:42.000> is

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
Greenwich is the goal and the goal is

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.640 
Greenwich is the goal and the goal is
different<00:04:42.690> for<00:04:42.780> everybody<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.230> set<00:04:43.470> your<00:04:43.620> own

set my goal for 3000 which is kind of

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.630 
set my goal for 3000 which is kind of
high<00:04:49.010> considering<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.280> sit<00:04:50.460> at<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.610> desk

high considering that I sit at a desk

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.940 
high considering that I sit at a desk
most<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.690> day<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.350> wanted<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.740> kind<00:04:52.920> of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
most of the day but I wanted to kind of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.920 
most of the day but I wanted to kind of
challenge<00:04:53.280> myself<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.000> try<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.690> get<00:04:54.840> out

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
challenge myself and and try to get out

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.960 
challenge myself and and try to get out
and<00:04:55.020> run<00:04:55.200> everyday<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.280> things<00:04:56.400> like<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.580> so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
and run everyday and things like that so

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.640 
and run everyday and things like that so
we'll<00:04:57.240> see<00:04:57.390> how<00:04:57.420> it<00:04:57.510> goes<00:04:57.630> so<00:04:58.380> what<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.530> do<00:04:58.620> is

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
we'll see how it goes so what you do is

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.080 
we'll see how it goes so what you do is
you<00:04:58.800> push<00:04:59.010> this<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.490> you'll<00:04:59.580> see<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.880> kind<00:05:00.030> of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
you push this and you'll see it kind of

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.720 
you push this and you'll see it kind of
rotates<00:05:00.510> through<00:05:00.870> there's<00:05:01.590> fuel<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> my

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
rotates through there's fuel and that my

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.040 
rotates through there's fuel and that my
fuel<00:05:02.940> score<00:05:03.180> today<00:05:03.300> is<00:05:03.390> 1549<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.680> push<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.610> again

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
fuel score today is 1549 I push it again

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.680 
fuel score today is 1549 I push it again
goes<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.170> calories<00:05:07.650> shows<00:05:08.310> 695<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.570> that's

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
goes to calories shows 695 and that's

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.240 
goes to calories shows 695 and that's
based<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.080> my<00:05:10.320> my<00:05:11.010> age<00:05:11.480> height<00:05:12.480> and<00:05:12.690> weight<00:05:12.870> and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
based on my my age height and weight and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.590 
based on my my age height and weight and
then<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.370> motion<00:05:14.730> then<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.060> movement<00:05:15.420> of

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
then the motion then the movement of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.530 
then the motion then the movement of
course<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.980> there's<00:05:17.160> steps<00:05:17.460> since<00:05:18.390> I've

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
course and then there's steps since I've

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.840 
course and then there's steps since I've
taken<00:05:18.770> 6039<00:05:19.770> steps<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.490> I've<00:05:20.580> got<00:05:20.730> it

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
taken 6039 steps and so I've got it

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.990 
taken 6039 steps and so I've got it
today<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.500> then<00:05:22.500> there's<00:05:22.710> time<00:05:22.920> so<00:05:23.820> those<00:05:23.970> are

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
today and then there's time so those are

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.880 
today and then there's time so those are
the<00:05:24.150> things<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.480> are<00:05:24.630> shown<00:05:24.810> on<00:05:24.990> there<00:05:25.200> now

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
the things that are shown on there now

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.740 
the things that are shown on there now
you<00:05:25.950> also<00:05:26.430> see<00:05:26.850> things<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.390> know<00:05:27.510> when<00:05:27.660> you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
you also see things you know when you
