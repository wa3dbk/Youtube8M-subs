00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
you can't evolve to make it you could

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120 
you can't evolve to make it you could
use<00:04:27.750> linguine<00:04:28.380> or<00:04:28.560> something<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:28.919> that

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
use linguine or something like that

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.710 
use linguine or something like that
but<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.580> will<00:04:29.639> also<00:04:29.760> take<00:04:30.090> take<00:04:30.419> longer<00:04:30.570> to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
but it will also take take longer to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.000 
but it will also take take longer to
cook<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.229> we<00:04:31.320> can<00:04:31.440> take<00:04:31.560> about<00:04:31.650> three

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
cook this we can take about three

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.820 
cook this we can take about three
minutes<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.370> cook<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:32.820> not<00:04:33.180> less

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.980 

now<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.729> way<00:04:38.819> take<00:04:39.030> very<00:04:39.360> much<00:04:39.449> time<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.840> cook

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
now that way take very much time to cook

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.450 
now that way take very much time to cook
and<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:40.680> won't<00:04:40.800> take<00:04:41.009> very<00:04:41.039> much<00:04:41.250> time

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
and this won't take very much time

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.760 
and this won't take very much time
either<00:04:41.639> so<00:04:41.879> we<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.150> put<00:04:42.300> our<00:04:42.530> fish<00:04:43.530> in

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
either so we just can put our fish in

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.890 
either so we just can put our fish in
just<00:04:44.280> sort<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.460> almost<00:04:45.270> kind<00:04:45.449> of<00:04:45.509> just<00:04:45.659> pop<00:04:45.810> it

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.689 
poaches we're not to be cook like really
a<00:04:51.509> lot<00:04:52.080> because<00:04:52.409> all<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.620> fish<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:53.009> cut<00:04:53.460> quite

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.880 

and<00:05:29.880> then<00:05:30.290> he's<00:05:31.290> going<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.470> toss<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.830> all

and then he's going to toss that all
together<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:32.970> then<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.540> actual<00:05:33.690> tossing<00:05:35.030> is

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
together and then the actual tossing is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.320

reduced

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.400 
reduced
cook<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.450> fish<00:05:54.630> as<00:05:54.750> much<00:05:54.780> as<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.230> I
