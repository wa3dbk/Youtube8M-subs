I have this flood switch right here so
once<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> bucket<00:01:04.229> fills<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:05.869> close<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
once the bucket fills up close the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
once the bucket fills up close the
switch<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:09.240> turns<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.200> RO<00:01:10.380> unit<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> I'll

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
switch it turns off the RO unit so I'll

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
switch it turns off the RO unit so I'll
plug<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> laundry<00:01:14.400> room<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.340> once<00:01:17.460> i'm
