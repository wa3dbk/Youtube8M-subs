00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.370 

today<00:00:00.299> we're<00:00:00.480> gonna<00:00:00.570> be<00:00:00.659> making<00:00:00.780> for

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
today we're gonna be making for

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.860 
today we're gonna be making for
turbulent<00:00:01.740> cars<00:00:01.979> stranded<00:00:02.310> animals<00:00:02.939> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
turbulent cars stranded animals the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.510 
turbulent cars stranded animals the
reason<00:00:04.140> we<00:00:04.230> need<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.500> formula<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.100> because<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
reason we need this formula is because a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.240 
reason we need this formula is because a
lot<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.819> these<00:00:06.029> animals<00:00:06.540> need<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.680> nutrients

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
lot of these animals need the nutrients

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.560 
lot of these animals need the nutrients
and<00:00:08.490> stuff<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.880> they're<00:00:09.059> not<00:00:09.179> getting

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
and stuff that they're not getting

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.570 
and stuff that they're not getting
because<00:00:09.719> they<00:00:10.019> are<00:00:10.260> feeding<00:00:10.469> fish<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.429> we're

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because they are feeding fish so we're

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.600 
because they are feeding fish so we're
using<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.030> formula<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:13.019> limit

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
using this formula it's just up limit

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.150 
using this formula it's just up limit
what<00:00:14.610> they're<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:14.940> eating<00:00:15.740> 50<00:00:16.740> pounds<00:00:17.100> of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
what they're not eating 50 pounds of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
what they're not eating 50 pounds of
fish<00:00:17.310> right<00:00:17.580> now<00:00:18.980> liters<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.160> water<00:00:23.660> we<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
fish right now liters of water we use a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.429 
fish right now liters of water we use a
blender<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:26.099> instead<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.760> using<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:28.050> baby

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
blender but instead we using this baby

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.779 
blender but instead we using this baby
the<00:00:29.310> emulsifier<00:00:30.289> pulling<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> fish

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:55.890 

and<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.449> blend

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.890 

basically<00:00:56.900> this<00:00:57.290> is<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.950> milk<00:00:58.730> based<00:00:59.120> charter

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
basically this is a milk based charter

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.050 
basically this is a milk based charter
formula<00:01:00.560> which<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:00.890> similar<00:01:01.550> where<00:01:01.850> it's

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
formula which is similar where it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.720 
formula which is similar where it's
substitute<00:01:02.750> for<00:01:03.380> what<00:01:03.560> females<00:01:04.130> alliance

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
substitute for what females alliance

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.510 
substitute for what females alliance
would<00:01:04.970> nurse<00:01:05.360> their<00:01:05.600> young<00:01:06.130> when<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:07.160> tell<00:01:07.430> you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
would nurse their young when I tell you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:30.500 
would nurse their young when I tell you
all<00:01:07.670> over<00:01:07.820> your<00:01:07.970> hands<00:01:09.430> probably<00:01:10.430> add<00:01:10.610> our

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510
