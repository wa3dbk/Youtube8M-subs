with other games specifically because of

reasons more along the lines of they no

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.890 
reasons more along the lines of they no

vehicle<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.070> racing<00:02:18.550> game<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.850> they

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
vehicle in like a racing game so they

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.220 
vehicle in like a racing game so they
have<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.120> take<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.420> entire<00:02:19.540> game<00:02:20.020> down

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
have to take the entire game down

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.480 
have to take the entire game down
because<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.680> can't<00:02:20.860> make<00:02:20.980> money<00:02:21.250> out<00:02:21.460> of

because they can't make money out of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.230 
because they can't make money out of
something<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.760> they're<00:02:21.880> not<00:02:21.970> allowed<00:02:22.180> to

something that they're not allowed to

something that they're not allowed to
make<00:02:22.450> money<00:02:22.630> off<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.130> that's<00:02:24.310> what's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
make money off and I think that's what's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.280 
make money off and I think that's what's
happening<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:24.970> Ultimate<00:02:25.540> Marvel<00:02:25.690> 3<00:02:26.080> right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
happening with Ultimate Marvel 3 right

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.800 
happening with Ultimate Marvel 3 right
now<00:02:26.490> pretty<00:02:27.490> much<00:02:27.610> based<00:02:28.030> off<00:02:28.180> my<00:02:28.360> assumption

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
now pretty much based off my assumption

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.060 
now pretty much based off my assumption
on<00:02:28.930> what's<00:02:29.080> been<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.560> over<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.860> past

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
on what's been going on over the past

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.610 
on what's been going on over the past
few<00:02:30.280> months<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.850> do<00:02:31.300> think<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.870> Capcom<00:02:32.260> no

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
few months I do think that Capcom no

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.800 
few months I do think that Capcom no

come to the States and somehow it did do

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.150 
come to the States and somehow it did do
to<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:55.960> much<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.290> passion<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.920> Seth

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
to pretty much the passion of like Seth

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
different than Japan he was able to do

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940 
different than Japan he was able to do
so<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.180> was<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.480> huge<00:03:01.870> cluster<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.710> all

Marvel vs. Capcom games in the future
but<00:04:43.449> at<00:04:43.509> this<00:04:43.750> point<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.470> possibility<00:04:45.190> of

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
in the future now is that Capcom

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.640 
in the future now is that Capcom
recognizes<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.810> yes<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.229> very<00:04:53.410> large
