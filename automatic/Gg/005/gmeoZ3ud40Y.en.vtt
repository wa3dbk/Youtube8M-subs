alpha gaming firstly for getting under
the<00:00:25.680> map<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> bring<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
zombie and I got under the map I was to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
zombie and I got under the map I was to
be<00:00:34.440> outside<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.180> isn't

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
be outside of it if you had this isn't

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
be outside of it if you had this isn't
was<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.020> old<00:00:37.230> glitch<00:00:37.559> post<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.190> couple<00:00:38.370> days<00:00:38.790> or

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
was an old glitch post a couple days or

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.319 
was an old glitch post a couple days or
weeks<00:00:39.239> ago<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:40.190> got<00:00:41.190> under<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> map<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
weeks ago I got under the map and you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
weeks ago I got under the map and you
know<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.469> annoying<00:00:43.980> glitch<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
know this is a very annoying glitch so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
know this is a very annoying glitch so
um<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> next<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.649> probably<00:00:46.920> going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
um the next thing you're probably going

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.110 
um the next thing you're probably going
to<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.460> me<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:48.270> clipping<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.670> you're

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to see me no clipping it so if you're

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
to see me no clipping it so if you're
patient<00:00:51.899> enough<00:00:52.140> i<00:00:52.440> guess<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.129> glitch

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
patient enough i guess to do this glitch

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
patient enough i guess to do this glitch
um<00:00:54.239> once<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:54.989> outside<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> map<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.920> go

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
um once you get outside the map you go

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
um once you get outside the map you go
where<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.570> then<00:00:57.570> creep<00:00:57.899> under<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.440> whole

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
where I go then creep under the whole

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.170 
where I go then creep under the whole
map<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.789> basically<00:01:00.539> follow<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> do

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
map and this basically follow what I do

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
map and this basically follow what I do
um<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.780> wouldn't<00:01:04.199> recommend<00:01:04.619> doing<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.949> I'd

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
um I wouldn't recommend doing this I'd

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
um I wouldn't recommend doing this I'd
recommend<00:01:05.610> doing<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.090> jury<00:01:06.420> sperry<00:01:06.960> glitch

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
recommend doing the jury sperry glitch

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
recommend doing the jury sperry glitch
on<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> railing<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.240> easier<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.140> don't

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
on to the railing it's easier you don't

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.300 
on to the railing it's easier you don't
do<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> crap<00:01:11.630> because<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.409> isn't

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
do a lot of crap because this one isn't

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
do a lot of crap because this one isn't
that<00:01:14.700> good<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:15.119> stock<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> can't<00:01:15.900> pick<00:01:16.080> up

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that good your stock you can't pick up

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.210 
that good your stock you can't pick up
power-ups<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.600> for<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> knife<00:01:18.869> lunge<00:01:19.220> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
power-ups and for the knife lunge you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
power-ups and for the knife lunge you
know<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.850> either<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> teleporter<00:01:21.900> method

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
know you either do the teleporter method

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.130 
know you either do the teleporter method
or<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.710> regular<00:01:23.640> method<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.990> new

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
or the regular method and then the new

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.920 
or the regular method and then the new
method<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> video<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
method which I do in the video so that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
method which I do in the video so that
you're<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> need<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> knife

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you're going to need to know a knife

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
you're going to need to know a knife
lunge<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> zombie<00:01:33.689> press<00:01:34.049> Y<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.680> knife

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
lunge go up to a zombie press Y a knife

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.200 
lunge go up to a zombie press Y a knife
or<00:01:36.409> shoot<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.619> knife<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.340> same<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
or shoot a knife at the same time that

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.010 
or shoot a knife at the same time that
will<00:01:39.390> also<00:01:39.540> work<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:41.220> line<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.549> your

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
will also work then line up your

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.920 
will also work then line up your
crosshairs<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.890> zombie<00:01:44.450> at<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> fence

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
crosshairs with the zombie at the fence

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.560 
crosshairs with the zombie at the fence
the<00:01:46.770> guy<00:01:47.009> should<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.430> near<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> car<00:01:47.939> 98<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the guy should be near the car 98 I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.050 
the guy should be near the car 98 I
think<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.229> name<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> gun<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.820> done

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
think that's name of the gun it done

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
think that's name of the gun it done
correctly<00:01:51.450> you'll<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.930> old<00:01:52.409> barrier

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
correctly you'll be on the old barrier

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
correctly you'll be on the old barrier
and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.570> once<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.290> goes<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.979> zombie<00:01:56.310> goes

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and then once he goes up the zombie goes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.130 
and then once he goes up the zombie goes
up<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.820> spot<00:01:57.890> get<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.009> lock<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.640> that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
up to that spot get your lock on on that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.310 
up to that spot get your lock on on that
again<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.979> tell<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.280> friend<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.320> UM
