so<00:02:32.440> that's<00:02:32.590> what<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:32.829> did<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.819> also<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.750> did<00:02:35.140> most

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
so that's what I did and also I did most

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.400 
so that's what I did and also I did most
of<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.739> using<00:02:36.160> my<00:02:36.640> blender<00:02:37.360> brush<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.049> I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
of this using my blender brush and I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.110 
of this using my blender brush and I
used<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.010> don't<00:02:39.370> know<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.579> my<00:02:39.700> son<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.910> doing

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
used I don't know what my son is doing

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.100 
used I don't know what my son is doing
and<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:41.380> used<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.799> liner<00:02:42.099> brush<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.940> my<00:02:43.900> shader

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
and I used my liner brush and my shader

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
and I used my liner brush and my shader
brush<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:44.829> three<00:02:45.190> brushes<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.730> don't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
brush so just three brushes I don't

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.910 
brush so just three brushes I don't
think<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.150> even<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.690> need<00:02:47.049> 100%<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
think you even really need 100% the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.460 
think you even really need 100% the
shader<00:02:48.129> brush<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.549> anyway<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> few

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
shader brush but anyway just a few

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.729 
shader brush but anyway just a few
brushes<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:52.510> think<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.049> used<00:02:53.079> all<00:02:53.470> matte

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
brushes and I think I used all matte

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.490 
brushes and I think I used all matte
shades<00:02:54.129> on<00:02:54.340> my<00:02:54.489> eyes<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.970> time<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.870> so

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
shades on my eyes this time and so

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.380 
shades on my eyes this time and so
that's<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> decided<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.879> do<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.000> will<00:02:58.269> have

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
that's what I decided to do I will have

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.020 
that's what I decided to do I will have
more<00:02:58.599> looks<00:02:58.870> with<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.170> lorac<00:02:59.410> Pro<00:02:59.709> palette

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
more looks with the lorac Pro palette

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.349 
more looks with the lorac Pro palette
with<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:02.140> more<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.829> my<00:03:03.459> types<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.120> looks

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
with probably more of my types of looks

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.080 
with probably more of my types of looks
so<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.530> hope<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.190> don't<00:03:06.250> disappoint<00:03:06.549> anybody

color cream all over from my lash line
to<00:04:17.459> my<00:04:17.580> brow<00:04:17.790> bone<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.239> focused<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.020> color<00:04:19.500> up

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
to my brow bone I focused the color up

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.430 
to my brow bone I focused the color up
on<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.370> brow<00:04:20.549> bone<00:04:20.790> area<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.810> just<00:04:21.840> make<00:04:22.410> sure

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
on the brow bone area so just make sure

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.970 
on the brow bone area so just make sure
that<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.970> really<00:04:24.270> visible<00:04:24.540> there<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.470> then

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
that it is really visible there I then

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.950 
that it is really visible there I then
got<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.370> color<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.670> dusty<00:04:27.150> plum<00:04:27.390> on<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.750> same

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.250 
got the color a dusty plum on the same
blending<00:04:28.200> brush<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.610> blended<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.750> too

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
blending brush and I blended that in too

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.720 
blending brush and I blended that in too
and<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:32.280> bit<00:04:32.520> above<00:04:33.180> my<00:04:33.540> crease<00:04:34.310> make<00:04:35.310> sure<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and a bit above my crease make sure you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.120 
and a bit above my crease make sure you
blend<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.570> really<00:04:36.780> well<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.680> where<00:04:37.890> the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
blend it in really well to where the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.100 
blend it in really well to where the
color<00:04:38.430> from<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.700> brow<00:04:38.970> bone<00:04:39.270> transitions

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
color from the brow bone transitions

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.220 
color from the brow bone transitions
real<00:04:40.740> nicely<00:04:41.580> into<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.480> color<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.200> looks

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
real nicely into this color so it looks

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:54.530 
real nicely into this color so it looks
soft<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.130> delicate<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.320> pretty<00:04:53.060> then<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.270> got

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
soft and delicate and pretty then I got

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.980 
soft and delicate and pretty then I got
the<00:04:54.720> color<00:04:54.990> espresso<00:04:55.920> I<00:04:56.250> put<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.270> into<00:04:57.720> my

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
the color espresso I put that into my

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.870 
the color espresso I put that into my
crease<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.820> focused<00:05:00.360> mostly<00:05:01.350> on<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.520> outer

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
crease and I focused mostly on the outer

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.150 
crease and I focused mostly on the outer
corner<00:05:03.600> there<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:04.050> didn't<00:05:04.410> bring<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.620> all<00:05:04.980> the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
corner there I didn't bring it all the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.860 
corner there I didn't bring it all the
way<00:05:05.280> into<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.610> inner<00:05:05.760> corner<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:06.660> kind<00:05:06.840> of

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
way into the inner corner just kind of

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.320 
way into the inner corner just kind of
outer<00:05:07.200> corner<00:05:07.650> into<00:05:07.980> about<00:05:08.250> halfway<00:05:08.760> point<00:05:09.180> of

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
outer corner into about halfway point of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.450 
outer corner into about halfway point of
the<00:05:09.510> crease<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.140> drag<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.040> rest<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.370> it

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
the crease and just drag the rest of it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.270 
the crease and just drag the rest of it
forward<00:05:12.290> once<00:05:13.290> again<00:05:13.410> make<00:05:13.740> sure<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:14.010> that's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
forward once again make sure that that's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.920 
forward once again make sure that that's
blended<00:05:14.700> out<00:05:14.970> really<00:05:15.240> well

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
blended out really well

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.400 
blended out really well
I<00:05:15.960> also<00:05:16.530> blended<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.310> down<00:05:17.670> kind<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.420> toward<00:05:18.900> my

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
I also blended it down kind of toward my

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.730 
I also blended it down kind of toward my
lashline<00:05:19.830> kind<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:20.910> making<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.480> outer<00:05:22.200> corner

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
lashline kind of making the outer corner

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.790 
lashline kind of making the outer corner
like<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:22.980> little<00:05:23.310> v-shape<00:05:24.320> then<00:05:25.320> I<00:05:25.470> got<00:05:25.680> the

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
like a little v-shape then I got the

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
with a shader brush you can also use

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.080 
with a shader brush you can also use
your<00:05:30.930> blender<00:05:31.260> brush<00:05:31.650> still<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:32.730> part

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
your blender brush still to do that part

your blender brush still to do that part
if<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.360> want<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.810> don't<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.280> use<00:05:35.280> this

if you want I don't know I just use this

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.950 
if you want I don't know I just use this
brush<00:05:35.790> because<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.180> was<00:05:36.300> there<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:36.720> it<00:05:36.810> could

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
brush because it was there but it could
