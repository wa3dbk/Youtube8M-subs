00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.990
 hi how about how are you all I hope that 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.309
 they are as always really 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.219
 fabulous thanks for joining me 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.039
 again this time I missed a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.280
 little bit in the continuity of the videos 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.920
 because I got sick of everything, it gave me a cold 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.280
 half a cough sickens me from the throat 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.910
 I had everything still a little bit hoarse 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.640
 but already a little better that was the reason 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.649
 which delays the videos a bit 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.230
 I had not been able to record I felt 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.179
 pretty bad and between the disease and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.899
 all the work that comes together in these 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:47.120
 dates because it was something very difficult to be able to 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.819
 keep doing the videos as I 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.489
 I would have liked it but thanks to all this 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.499
 ball of the virus that came out in me 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.569
 throat was that I got lost 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.629
 practice many news to all 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:02.600
 you and the main one of them is the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.440
 new breakthrough that we saw from the movie of 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.460
 star wars 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.799
 episode 7 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.170
 I really wanted to talk with 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.510
 all of you but I was knocked down in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.700
 the bed and I could not do it so although 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.340
 be a little bit late I want to talk to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.920
 all of you and above all know what is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.200
 their opinion that they have about this first 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 advance that first advance here I am 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.659
 seeing we see that it lasted a minute with 30 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.840
 seconds between the cuts between 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.680
 scenes and apart are at the beginning they are like 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.899
 10 seconds in total darkness I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 I think the advance lasted like a minute 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.850
 at the beginning we see the desert obviously 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.149
 it has to be tatooine and suddenly it comes out 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.550
 this character this trooper stand who 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.950
 there will be the rumor that it will be a 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.560
 main character in the saga 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.570
 best and then we could see this droid 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 which is like a little ball that is spinning 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 and has the little head like arto that was a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 droid that impacts all of us 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.649
 immediately began to make memes of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 this new droid that we could see in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.440
 this advance since they were all from a 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.550
 soccer ball but it was something 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.910
 also very father 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.210
 to keep watching there we see the new 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.580
 helmets of the stormtroopers this is a 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.600
 very important part in what is 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.510
 you can see they look pretty father but 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 abused because they are the stormtroopers and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.480
 if they make a very exaggerated change or something 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.090
 that we do not like the fans is going to be 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.570
 quite complicated to accept these new 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.990
 troops but in the scene they look pretty 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.030
 acceptable continues the trailer and we see 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.730
 this girl in the east 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.350
 in this speeder that could be the daughter 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.440
 they leave alone and of law to queen alone and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.110
 they also told me of an error when 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.230
 girl goes up to the speeder carrying a rifle 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.320
 and then it does not bring is terrible come out this 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.490
 spider and again in the dark after 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.420
 we see 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.520
 this senate was also impressive 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 see again the ix wind like this 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.820
 squadron flying flush with water this 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.630
 amazing was the parts that I most 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.810
 excited and there we are seeing this 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 walking site in this forest full of 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.480
 snow there lights your saber this 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.730
 it was also an impact on the networks 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 social because as soon as the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.280
 memes were seen everywhere 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.490
 especially the sword that has this 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 medieval cross or sword shape that 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.860
 something that we can see here I do not know what 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.770
 you think they are in a forest of 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.630
 ice and if we observe well the sword that 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.010
 carry is not the light sheet is not 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.680
 completely straight as we can see 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.030
 always in the swords of your they carry 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.209
 this looks like 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.900
 it does not look completely straight which I 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.750
 makes you think by the shape of the sheet and the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.400
 form of the sword that has this is what 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.400
 who told them this medieval form 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.730
 that what is about a sit of the 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 Old Republic because that is sable 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.700
 very rustic is not as sophisticated as 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.430
 the last ones could be that they revive some 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.330
 site in old republic is an idea 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.600
 critical 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.130
 we will continue long in black and 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.030
 to see the glorious millennial hawk 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.340
 flying again 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.850
 I think to all the fans when we saw 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.510
 this scene happened this the skin was on us 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.960
 Chinese completely see this 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.230
 mythical star war vehicle with the 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.720
 new square antenna because the antenna 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.240
 square there we are seeing it is because 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.240
 if we remember when lando piloted in the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.710
 food in Aryan they lost the antenna and it's 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.230
 why he has it here again 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.510
 square there we see those three pass 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.420
 parts and 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.900
 legendary lyrics of star wars the 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.900
 force 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.769
 I do not know what you think, I'm still 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.349
 totally ecstatic even though I 've 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:27.729
 seen many times December the 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:32.800
 2015 will be released on December 8 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.740
 it's still very long going to be a torture 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.630
 for all star wars fans to endure 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.790
 one more year to see all this 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.040
 let's see what other advances we 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.530
 present I really expected a 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.220
 little bit more we did not see much what we 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.380
 they let see was practically nothing like that 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.650
 it has to be nothing we have to 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.210
 keep captives completely always 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.970
 attentive of what is happening 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.650
 Well that's what I wanted to talk with 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.490
 you on this occasion is going to be a 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.590
 short video and I will try to keep them 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.340
 a little more aware of everything that goes 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.740
 happening with episode 7 of stable 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.050
 with nothing more to talk about at the moment 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.780
 I'm more interested in knowing your opinions 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.930
 so I say goodbye to all of you 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.130
 Greetings I am your friend Charly and see you 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.130
 the next 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.440
 on-line 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.210
 justin spot 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.219
 yes 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.560
 so for now that would be all 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.130
 and then up to three of the 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.130
 characteristics 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.030
 and has a little head like him
