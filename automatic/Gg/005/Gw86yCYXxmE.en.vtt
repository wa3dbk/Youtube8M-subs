bjbjLULU RAY SUAREZ: Finally tonight, the
true tale of a Christmas Eve attack and rescue

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.590
during World War II, retold by a Minnesota
congregation. Special correspondent Fred de

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.060
Sam Lazaro has our story. FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
At the annual holiday dinner at Westminster

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.060
Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, people
are encouraged to share personal Christmas

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.490
stories. This year, Pastor Tim Hart-Andersen
delivered an epic. REV. TIM HART-ANDERSEN,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.660
Westminster Presbyterian Church: So you are
a radio studio audience tonight for WPCB,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.069
Westminster Presbyterian Church Broadcast
Company. (LAUGHTER) FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Dozens

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:43.399
of volunteers came together to build a set
simulating a 1940s-style radio drama, arranged

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:53.539
by "Prairie Home Companion" veteran and church
member Vern Sutton. It's based on a true story

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.409
the pastor heard from his father when he was
growing up. MAN: The night before Christmas,

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:07.830
1944. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: On Dec. 24, 1944,
as the decisive Battle of the Bulge raged,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.750
some 2,200 American G.I.s boarded the ship
Leopoldville in England headed for the battle's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:22.960
Belgian frontier. MAN: It just don't feel
like Christmas Eve. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Hart-Andersen's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.550
father, Hank Andersen, was crammed in the
ship's hold. REV. HENRY "HANK" ANDERSEN, Leopoldville

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.730
survivor: It was just a miserable situation.
So I said, let's go up on deck and sing Christmas

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.810
carols. I would say there were 15 to 20 of
us were there. And we were singing Christmas

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.680
carols. And I was leading them. And all of
a sudden, this is becoming a rather tender

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:01.460
story. And we can see the lights of Cherbourg
in the distance. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The drama

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.360
used sound effects to convey the disaster
that was about to strike as the ship was just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.150
off the French coast. Some 800 lives were
lost in the deadliest incident of the war

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340
for the U.S. Army. WOMAN: Emergency stations.
Emergency stations. All hands to emergency

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:27.739
stations. The Leopold's been hit. WOMAN: The
U-boat torpedo hits the Leopoldville below

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.790
the waterline on the starboard side. Scores
of those lovely Yankee boys are killed instantly

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.779
by the explosion. Others drown as water rushes
into the ship. Most of the survivors stand

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.590
on the deck and watch as other ships come
alongside to begin rescue operations. MAN:

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.590
Hey, Sarge, Sarge, Sarge, what do we do? That
British destroyer, it s pulled up alongside

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:04.010
us. Shall we make a jump for it? REV. HENRY
"HANK" ANDERSEN: These guys were paralyzed.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.030
They just would not jump. And -- and they
had seen some jump and not made it. So, it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.239
was quite a jump across. And I remember getting
over there and sliding across what little

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:29.180
deck there was, slammed into the bulwark that
was there, staggered back up to the rail.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.370
And the sight that I had made it enabled them
then to start jumping. MAN: Gee, Rosenblum,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.470
are you going to jump? MAN: Is there another
choice? FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The character

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.090
Rosenblum was written into the drama when
Gail Rosenblum, a local columnist, came across

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.700
Andersen's story. Her late father, Sidney,
was on the ship, and she's convinced he was

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.529
in the singing group. And that, she'd like
to think, influenced her love of this music.

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.559
GAIL ROSENBLUM, Minneapolis Star Tribune:
My friends joke. They tease me because I'm

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.850
a Jewish girl who loves Christmas carols.
I always loved them as a girl. And so, when

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.239
I heard the story of Hank and put that all
together, I felt like now I understand why

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.139
I love them. They saved my father's life,
because all the men who came up on deck to

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.850
sing, thanks to Hank leading them up there,
they survived. And all the men who didn't

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.470
come up were the victims of that, you know,
that torpedo. REV. TIM HART-ANDERSEN: Her

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.720
father had this love of music before he went
into the service. My father did. And the more

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.420
we talked, the more we began to sense a kind
of narrative that really wound together in

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.890
some pretty remarkable ways. MAN: Hey, Archer,
can't a Jew enjoy the lights and sing a few

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.140
tunes? MAN: You sing Christmas music? MAN:
So, who do you think does the best Christmas

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:49.480
music? Ever wonder about that? Irving Berlin?
Mel Torme? Johnny Marks? All Jews. "Winter

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.250
Wonderland," "White Christmas" all invented
by my people. Who else would name a red-nosed

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:05.060
reindeer Rudolph? (LAUGHTER) FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
His family says Sid Rosenblum talked very

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.600
little about his war experience. He went on
to become a psychologist. Sid Rosenblum died

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.280
in 1988 at 63. Hank Andersen was headed to
a law career before the war, but became a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.750
minister instead. He was an active civil rights
campaigner in the '60s, influenced during

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.840
the war by an all-black unit in the then-segregated
Army which fed and comforted the ship's survivors

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.530
when they reached land. REV. HENRY "HANK"
ANDERSEN: They surrounded us and sang Christmas

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:47.400
carols. And I -- I was so stunned. FRED DE
SAM LAZARO: At 87, Hank Andersen lives in

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.900
retirement with Mary Andersen, his wife of
64 years. MAN: The Yanks who survived found

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.400
a whole new meaning to that Christmas day.
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Tim Hart-Andersen says

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.930
he's glad his father is still alive to see
an important story preserved by and for the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.900
next generation, one that, in some ways, has
morphed into a sermon. REV. TIM HART-ANDERSEN:

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:16.460
I would hope that the kind of universal theme
here is that hope cannot be cut off and light

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:31.050
cannot be turned off. The human spirit can
sing its way through anything. RAY SUAREZ:
