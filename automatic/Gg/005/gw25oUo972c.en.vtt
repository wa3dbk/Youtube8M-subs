00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
of the zen alarm clock which i invented

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.779 
of the zen alarm clock which i invented
in<00:00:13.469> 1995<00:00:14.389> this<00:00:15.389> clock<00:00:15.779> wakes<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.949> gradually

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
in 1995 this clock wakes you gradually

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.050 
in 1995 this clock wakes you gradually
with<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.269> series<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> acoustic<00:00:19.320> chimes<00:00:20.060> when

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
with a series of acoustic chimes when

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.940 
with a series of acoustic chimes when
the<00:00:21.150> alarm<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.510> triggered<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:22.410> strikes<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
the alarm is triggered it strikes this

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.630 
the alarm is triggered it strikes this
chime<00:00:23.750> just<00:00:24.750> once<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.260> then<00:00:25.980> automatically

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
chime just once and then automatically

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
chime just once and then automatically
this<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.270> computer<00:00:27.630> inside<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.960> clock<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this little computer inside the clock so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
this little computer inside the clock so
that<00:00:28.590> after<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.160> strike<00:00:29.510> three

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that after the first strike three

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.110 
that after the first strike three
minutes<00:00:30.779> later<00:00:31.020> it<00:00:31.440> chimes<00:00:31.770> again<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.399> then

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
minutes later it chimes again and then

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
minutes later it chimes again and then
in<00:00:33.210> two<00:00:33.390> minutes<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.289> in<00:00:34.379> one<00:00:34.559> minute<00:00:34.770> so

chimes reel closer together until

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.229 
chimes reel closer together until
eventually<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.069> striking<00:00:41.579> every<00:00:42.030> five

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
eventually it's striking every five

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.599 
eventually it's striking every five
seconds<00:00:42.659> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> turn<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.139> off<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.579> a

you to lie in bed perfectly still as the
chimes<00:00:55.319> gradually<00:00:55.920> progress<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.549> their

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
chimes gradually progress for their

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.669 
chimes gradually progress for their
ten-minute<00:00:57.209> sequence<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> gives<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.589> the

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
ten-minute sequence and it gives you the

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.169 
ten-minute sequence and it gives you the
perfect<00:00:58.920> opportunity<00:00:59.069> to<00:00:59.549> transition

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
perfect opportunity to transition

perfect opportunity to transition
between<00:01:00.329> sleeping<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.260> waking<00:01:01.519> we<00:01:02.519> fall

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
between sleeping and waking we fall

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.509 
between sleeping and waking we fall
asleep<00:01:02.850> naturally<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.260> gradually<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
asleep naturally and gradually so it's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.800 
asleep naturally and gradually so it's
only<00:01:05.640> natural<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.270> body<00:01:06.450> wants<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
only natural that your body wants to

only natural that your body wants to
wake<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.140> gradually<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.369> Zen<00:01:08.490> alarm

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
wake up gradually and the Zen alarm

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.180

clock allows you to do that the acoustic
chimes<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.850> beautiful<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.420> well

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
chimes are really beautiful as well

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.350 
chimes are really beautiful as well
unlike<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> recorded<00:01:14.370> sounds<00:01:14.940> that<00:01:15.120> come

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
unlike the recorded sounds that come

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
unlike the recorded sounds that come
with<00:01:16.140> many<00:01:16.350> alarm<00:01:16.680> clocks<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:18.060> chime<00:01:18.360> has

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
with many alarm clocks this chime has

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630 
with many alarm clocks this chime has
been<00:01:18.750> tuned<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> same<00:01:20.070> frequencies

been tuned to be in the same frequencies

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.070 
been tuned to be in the same frequencies
