00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that I really like about this wallet is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.570 
that I really like about this wallet is
that<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.609> choose<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.750> interior<00:00:19.260> color<00:00:19.800> so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that you can choose an interior color so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689 
that you can choose an interior color so
I<00:00:20.880> chose<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> red<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.460> really

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I chose the red it's really really

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.500 
I chose the red it's really really
pretty<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> past<00:00:26.090> this<00:00:27.090> wallet

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
pretty I know in the past this wallet

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.279 
pretty I know in the past this wallet
actually<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.710> believe<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.490> red<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.750> leather

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
actually I believe the red was leather

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.160 
actually I believe the red was leather
but<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> feel<00:00:32.759> inside<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> wallet<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but when I feel inside of the wallet it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
but when I feel inside of the wallet it
feels<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.620> leather<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.250> part

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
feels like leather but this part

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.139 
feels like leather but this part
definitely<00:00:36.030> feels<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.600> canvas<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:39.000> get

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
definitely feels like canvas so to get

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.930 
definitely feels like canvas so to get
into<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> details<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.290> wallet<00:00:40.730> in<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
into the details of this wallet in the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.900 
into the details of this wallet in the
front<00:00:42.860> there<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.160> four<00:00:44.610> card<00:00:45.059> slots<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
front there are four card slots and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.479 
front there are four card slots and
unlike<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.510> Emily<00:00:49.110> wallet<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.860> card<00:00:50.160> slots

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
unlike the Emily wallet the card slots

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
unlike the Emily wallet the card slots
actually<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> bifold<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> open

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
actually are a bifold so when you open

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.689 
actually are a bifold so when you open
it<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.170> there<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.160> four<00:00:56.399> slots

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it up like this there are the four slots

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
it up like this there are the four slots
right<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> trifold

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right here I really like the trifold

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
right here I really like the trifold
because<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> wallet<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> super<00:01:00.390> super<00:01:00.600> thin

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because this wallet is super super thin

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
because this wallet is super super thin
even<00:01:01.680> though<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.640> trifold<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:05.090> when<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
even though it is a trifold but when you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
even though it is a trifold but when you
fold<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> feel<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.799> adds<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
fold this down I feel like it adds a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
fold this down I feel like it adds a
little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.640> more<00:01:08.970> protection<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.810> cards

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
little bit more protection to your cards

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
little bit more protection to your cards
should<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:11.070> fall<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.549> um<00:01:11.939> another<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
should they fall out um another thing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
should they fall out um another thing
that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.460> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
