them up this particular pedal has three
chickenhead<00:00:43.680> knobs<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.940> level<00:00:45.269> which<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
chickenhead knobs the level which is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.320 
chickenhead knobs the level which is
obviously<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.230> volume<00:00:46.640> your<00:00:47.640> fuzz<00:00:48.000> amount

obviously your volume your fuzz amount

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.530 
obviously your volume your fuzz amount
which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.900> over<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:50.309> tone<00:00:50.550> when<00:00:51.420> it's

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
switches basically this dip switch over

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.700 
switches basically this dip switch over
here<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.330> down<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.540> bottom<00:01:03.690> give<00:01:04.589> you

muffy<00:01:09.560> that's<00:01:10.560> led<00:01:11.010> clipping<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.440> when<00:01:13.440> it's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
muffy that's led clipping and when it's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
muffy that's led clipping and when it's
in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> middle<00:01:13.790> you'll<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.970> boost<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.540> is
