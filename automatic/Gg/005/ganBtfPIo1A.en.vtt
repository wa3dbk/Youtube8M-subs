 Hello everyone, Misha and I are today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.189
 we play dick head 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.730
 in short, we will say why the game is so 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.920
 certainly not complicated you need to run run with 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.610
 a sword to walk and rivals and not 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 getting caught 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.710
 the temple bump into these protector and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 score goals 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 goalkeeper cults and accordingly 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.960
 then run the more points you dial 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 and the harder it gets the more if 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.890
 you did not pass by you die well yes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 either gas and so here you die before 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 you must either score a goal or run away 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 the gate in both cases is not better to score 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.460
 Goal because for this they will give some more 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.579
 There points or man moron try 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.379
 again and so and accordingly you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 earn some meters here 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.079
 number of heads number of meters per 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.589
 This is the number of goals for this number. 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 meters you can discover new 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.750
 principle run off and not score a goal 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 characters are all sorts of different people 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.689
 nothing okke are different players and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.549
 incomprehensible this game allowed these 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.580
 players 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.520
 Sinai as well, but I wanted no project 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.399
 why did we take on this game 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 generally how to get out of here why ostap not 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.239
 baptized cross above why come from 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.730
 talk about this game because 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.220
 there is shorter 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 youtube and it is shorter as youtube 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.970
 the person who created this game we 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.790
 continue finger box then here who is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.550
 in short, there is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.200
 v2s v2s have him here's a trick with which he 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.680
 plays such a dark pussy 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 kindergarten there is that ipodipay 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.310
 Yes, and even more expensive than two dudes 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.489
 then youtube shorter but it's cool 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.959
 because they probably did all these 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.540
 YouTube and there they have millions of subscribers 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.599
 they told us that the game came out 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.340
 which is shorter 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.989
 yes for them in short to play but it 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.330
 already for money you can block these 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.459
 YouTube they are respectively paid and we 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.900
 Now we can play for those who 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:59.100
 blocked am on this on speed 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.140
 christians go and scores all sorts constantly 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 different balls of pancakes soft clear 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.950
 call decorative and ball from i to and i 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:24.900
 show you the number on the back of Carolyn type 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:27.799
 also for the local Murzin team to play 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.720
 well well in short yes I will be like together 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.519
 all play where you play for from finnish 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.049
 the team well, since it plays chronically 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.389
 so to me in such children's games 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.830
 It passes not so right there every day 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.950
 workout 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.140
 from this year let's go shorter for and come on 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.860
 In principle, everything is probably black about 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.440
 youtuber told peasants the most 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.270
 cool in this game that is i well 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.030
 about dante what 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.470
 but also can continue to live can 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.110
 passing guessing will make the game 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.100
 there is at least this akinator which people in 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.770
 year out shorter guesses me and sort 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.060
 how there even guesses Yasha Misha and here 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.410
 maybe shorter if we have him 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.950
 several disorders and this program 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.950
 akinator 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 think there will be stories then maybe you 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.660
 teach and I guess and there they pass 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.549
 in short there the computer asks you a question 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.230
 This program for this questions and you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.230
 include it according to crit I 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.300
 I think it is there Krishna on I think it 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.060
 vilsakom i think it's there queens mikhail 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.560
 there or cheeks and shorter guesses 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.930
 personalized and confront madonna and 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.250
 Pugacheva generally guesses me easily 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.350
 for example there may be something difficult to guess, we 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.210
 with him a pony review but I want to 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.220
 First it played wrote 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.760

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.540
