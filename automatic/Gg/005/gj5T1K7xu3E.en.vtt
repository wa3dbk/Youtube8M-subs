00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
colors really well in there now let's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.310 
colors really well in there now let's
take<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.870> pin<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.420> underneath<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> twist<00:02:49.900> see

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
take a pin and underneath the twist see

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.390 
take a pin and underneath the twist see
because<00:02:50.470> my<00:02:50.650> hair<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.830> going<00:02:50.980> straight<00:02:51.250> back

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
because my hair is going straight back

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.610 
because my hair is going straight back
I'm<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.910> pin<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.830> pin<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:56.380> way

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
I'm going to pin the pin going that way

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.020 
I'm going to pin the pin going that way
so<00:02:56.860> let's<00:02:56.980> go<00:02:57.070> ahead<00:02:57.100> cross<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.700> grand<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:57.970> my

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
it and I'm just taking it twisting

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.460 
it and I'm just taking it twisting
twisting<00:03:05.560> twisting<00:03:06.570> again<00:03:07.570> not<00:03:07.840> very<00:03:08.140> tightly

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
twisting twisting again not very tightly

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
twisting twisting again not very tightly
because<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:09.010> want<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.370> big<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.300> know<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.570> is

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
because I want it big you know this is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.820 
because I want it big you know this is
Texas<00:03:11.080> everything's<00:03:11.500> bigger<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.800> Texas<00:03:12.250> so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
Texas everything's bigger in Texas so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.130 
Texas everything's bigger in Texas so
then<00:03:14.830> take<00:03:15.010> another<00:03:15.040> pin<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.620> secure<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.160> end

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
then take another pin and secure the end

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.240 
then take another pin and secure the end
to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:21.459> top<00:03:21.700> knot<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> pin<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.250> and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
to the top knot with a pin like this and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.890 
to the top knot with a pin like this and
the<00:03:24.489> reason<00:03:24.549> I<00:03:24.820> use<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.090> two<00:03:25.209> colors<00:03:25.450> because

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900

with<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.650> lot<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.360> strengthening

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
with this it's a lot of strengthening

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.720 
with this it's a lot of strengthening
once<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.840> pin<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.110> in<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:24.980> now<00:04:25.160> I'm<00:04:25.220> taking<00:04:25.430> it

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
once you pin it in so now I'm taking it

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.700 
once you pin it in so now I'm taking it
and<00:04:25.850> I'm<00:04:25.970> setting<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.570> inside<00:04:27.139> that<00:04:27.500> loop

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
and I'm setting it inside that loop

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.879 
and I'm setting it inside that loop
that's<00:04:27.889> already<00:04:28.160> been<00:04:28.310> created<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.889> I'm

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
that's already been created and I'm

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.170 
that's already been created and I'm
pinning<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:32.300> tail<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.550> base<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.030> top

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
pinning the tail to the base of the top

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.440 
pinning the tail to the base of the top
line<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:37.100> like<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.370> did<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.550> first<00:04:37.639> time<00:04:37.880> so

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
line just like I did the first time so

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.570 
line just like I did the first time so
now<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.960> second<00:04:39.470> one<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.740> kind<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.040> nestled

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
now that second one is kind of nestled

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.070
