00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
well here's the David Brown 12:12

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.470 
well here's the David Brown 12:12
that<00:00:04.770> we're<00:00:04.950> fixing<00:00:05.400> for<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> guy<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:06.210> in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
that we're fixing for a guy for in

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.120 
that we're fixing for a guy for in
exchange<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.990> hundred<00:00:07.680> gallons<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.040> diesel

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
exchange for hundred gallons of diesel

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.169 
exchange for hundred gallons of diesel
fuel<00:00:08.719> well<00:00:10.130> here's<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.250> differential<00:00:11.820> off<00:00:12.000> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
fuel well here's a differential off of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.280 
fuel well here's a differential off of
it<00:00:12.300> big<00:00:12.719> tires

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it big tires

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.289 
it big tires
only<00:00:14.009> call<00:00:14.190> them<00:00:14.309> big<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> tractor<00:00:15.030> but

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
only call them big for a tractor but

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.400 
only call them big for a tractor but
anyways<00:00:15.920> here's<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.070> Justin<00:00:17.520> drink<00:00:18.230> out<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
anyways here's your Justin drink out of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
anyways here's your Justin drink out of
the<00:00:19.470> differential<00:00:20.039> that's<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.460> broken<00:00:20.939> like

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the differential that's all broken like

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
the differential that's all broken like
that's<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.250> circular<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.430> then<00:00:23.789> it's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that's what the circular and then it's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.529 
that's what the circular and then it's
wrecked<00:00:24.150> into<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:25.260> half<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.960> sets<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
wrecked into this half and it sets the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.640 
wrecked into this half and it sets the
carrier<00:00:30.539> bearing<00:00:30.900> preload<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.320> think

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
carrier bearing preload I think

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.240 
carrier bearing preload I think
something<00:00:32.130> around<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.520> Oh<00:00:33.469> main<00:00:34.469> thing

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
something around there Oh main thing

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.819 
something around there Oh main thing
wants<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> chain<00:00:35.870> get<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.079> planetary<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
wants to chain get this planetary so

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.900 
wants to chain get this planetary so
it'll<00:00:38.010> turn<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> sees<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> brake

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it'll turn because it sees and the brake

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.000 
it'll turn because it sees and the brake
is<00:00:42.090> burnt<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> bolt<00:00:45.289> off<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
is burnt off and this bolt off of the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
is burnt off and this bolt off of the
breakdown<00:00:47.489> completely<00:00:48.390> missing<00:00:50.420> well<00:00:51.420> anyway

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
breakdown completely missing well anyway

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170 
breakdown completely missing well anyway
we<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.410> far<00:00:52.590> apart<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.250> look

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we got it so far apart and then look

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.750 
we got it so far apart and then look
what<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.539> found

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
what we found

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.420 
what we found
trouble<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> doesn't<00:00:57.149> work<00:00:57.270> did<00:00:59.120> you<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
trouble it doesn't work did you see that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
trouble it doesn't work did you see that
see<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.460> line<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.809> crack<00:01:04.220> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
see that line there that's a crack it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
see that line there that's a crack it
was<00:01:05.339> all<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.479> I'll<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.960> put

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
was all the way down here I'll go put

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.899 
was all the way down here I'll go put
your<00:01:07.260> knife

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
your knife

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:21.900 
your knife
hey<00:01:08.909> sniff<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.330> wait

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.100 

we're<00:01:22.910> in<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.150> more<00:01:23.300> time<00:01:23.570> try<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.780> find

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
we're in have more time try to find

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:38.130 
we're in have more time try to find
something<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:25.370> cord<00:01:26.350> grew<00:01:27.350> breasts<00:01:27.970> okay

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.840 

that's<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.320> crack<00:01:41.350> that's<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.590> crack<00:01:42.890> that's<00:01:43.610> a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that's a crack that's a crack that's a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.320 
that's a crack that's a crack that's a
crack<00:01:44.260> that<00:01:45.260> crack<00:01:45.560> extends<00:01:46.369> up<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.520> top<00:01:47.030> there

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
crack that crack extends up to top there

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.440 
crack that crack extends up to top there
so<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:49.010> cracks<00:01:49.520> cracked<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.119> way<00:01:50.270> down

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so the cracks cracked all the way down

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.660 
so the cracks cracked all the way down
there<00:01:51.100> but<00:01:52.100> that's<00:01:52.340> not<00:01:52.580> good<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.490> this

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
there but that's not good so this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.730 
there but that's not good so this
tractor<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:56.600> assuming<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:57.229> done<00:01:57.470> unless

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
tractor we're assuming is done unless

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.300 
tractor we're assuming is done unless
the<00:01:58.040> owner<00:01:58.310> wants<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:59.170> pay<00:02:00.170> for<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.070> this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the owner wants to pay for this is this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.859 
the owner wants to pay for this is this
all<00:02:01.580> this<00:02:01.729> stuff<00:02:02.000> in<00:02:02.149> here<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> get<00:02:02.479> fixed

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
all this stuff in here to get fixed

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.400 
all this stuff in here to get fixed
properly<00:02:03.399> I'll<00:02:04.399> be<00:02:04.580> round<00:02:04.729> forward<00:02:05.030> around

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
properly I'll be round forward around

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.760 
properly I'll be round forward around
not<00:02:06.410> counting<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.280> front<00:02:07.580> piece<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.619> it's

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
not counting this front piece so it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.250 
not counting this front piece so it's
probably<00:02:10.039> toast
