00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.340
 calculate the values ​​of the figure 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.680
 question so that the number 51 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.540
 question 2 is divisible by 11 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.480
 a procedure to see that a number 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.670
 is divisible by 11 is the definition 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.000
 do the division between 11 and see if the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.529
 rest gives us 0 other than normally you 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.760
 allows you to shorten this coges 51 for 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.250
 questionable number 2 let's keep it 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.400
 of questioning does not bother me 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.400
 you take the figures the odd position 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.770
 the figure is an odd position would be 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.040
 first figure third figure 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.720
 then it would be 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.830
 sum figures 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.830
 position in pair 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.129
 21 stress and now you make the sum in 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.129
 the figures in the position for 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.079
 what are the remaining 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.060
 which we have not indicated is there 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.060
 that's five more questions 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 then the biggest minus the most 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.220
 small for this number to be 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.770
 divisible by 11 the largest minus the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 small of these two things that we have 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.420
 put here the difference between these 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.020
 two things has to be zero divisible 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.850
 by 11 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.080
 then the biggest one is obviously 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 this here five more questions 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.940
 - the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.440
 smaller 3 although if it does it's at 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.080
 reverse posted will come out in negative numbers 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.120
 but we already know the multiples of 11 are 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.210
 the 11 22 the 33 etc or the less 11 - 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.250
 22 minus 33 etc. so this result 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.250
 it has to be invisible by another 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.220
 but this result much is 5 + 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 question minus 35 minus 322 more 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.510
 question mark 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.620
 2 + question has to be divisible 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.940
 for 11 2 more questions divisible by 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.380
 London 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.380
 note that it is a number 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.880
 positive has to be divisible by 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.590
 1100 will not be and a negative number will not 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.440
 what is going to be is not a number either 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.880
 positive and you take question when it's 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.300
 divisible by 11 when it is 11 22 33 as 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.410
 question is a number will be between 0 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.170
 and 9 then at most it will be worth when 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:57.340
 question is 9 when questions 9 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 2 + 9 11 so that question is 9 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.900
 51 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.530
 question that in this case 92 is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.600
 divisible by a c 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.700
 that is the maximum value that can 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.709
 reaching the question is when is 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.290
 divisible by where for more figures 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.540
 small is divisible by 11 then 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.350
 let's notice that 2 more something smaller 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.050
 that 9 will never get to 11 so 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.370
 both will not be divisible by 11 by 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.140
 so when so that the value of the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.590
 Questionable number is divisible by 11 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.590
 it is for questioning equal to 9
