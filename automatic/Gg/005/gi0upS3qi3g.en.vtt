right<00:00:54.900> back<00:00:55.140> into<00:00:55.560> my<00:00:55.770> speeder<00:00:56.100> bike<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> take

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
right back into my speeder bike and take

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.000 
right back into my speeder bike and take
it<00:00:57.240> over<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.570> hill<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.110> attack<00:00:58.440> our<00:00:58.620> first

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it over the hill to attack our first

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
it over the hill to attack our first
enemy<00:00:59.310> base<00:01:00.380> by<00:01:01.380> destroying<00:01:01.680> enemy<00:01:01.980> bases

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
enemy base by destroying enemy bases

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.860 
enemy base by destroying enemy bases
we're<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.240> be<00:01:03.450> able<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> take

we're gonna actually be able to take

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.380 
we're gonna actually be able to take
those<00:01:04.049> bases<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.009> ourselves<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> we're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
those bases over for ourselves so we're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
those bases over for ourselves so we're
going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.630> over<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.110> jump<00:01:08.009> out<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> build

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
going to go over here jump out and build

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
going to go over here jump out and build
a<00:01:09.749> small<00:01:10.350> air<00:01:10.649> support<00:01:11.189> pad<00:01:11.399> I<00:01:13.280> don't<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.340> why

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
a small air support pad I don't know why

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
a small air support pad I don't know why
but<00:01:14.789> my<00:01:14.939> favorite<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.719> ATR<00:01:16.229> t<00:01:16.439> he<00:01:16.890> runs
