00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.420
 true to its reputation the Swedish manufacturer claims that the 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.569
 xc60 and the good fly to safer ever built 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.819
 a great asset, coupled with an aggressive tariff offer 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.519
 allow this new and super compact premium to get a place on a 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.419
 market reigns in master bmw x3 audi q5 and other mercedes glk 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.959
 the first cross-over companion in its history volvo put the dishes 

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.890
 in large or rather large in small 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 the xc60 is indeed a kind of mix and 90 in reduction 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.830
 nevertheless he has rather to his advantage 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.980
 it looks more like a secondary carmat high break 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.499
 normal since it measures 4 meters 63 from the om 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.460
 when his big brother shows 4 meter 80 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.040
 very nice face or profile and its design is quite 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.300
 amazing seen from behind 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.230
 we hate one thing is sure the characteristic designs of these lights there 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.850
 do not leave indifferent 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.630
 to Fri 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.309
 he was aboard high school 67 be done from the very first moment 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.020
 it must be said that our xenium version has something to seduce 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 with its series of tanned leather agent and brushed aluminum dashboard 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.799
 materials and assemblies are of high quality 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.799
 like the floating console now oriented towards the driver 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 add to that very comfortable seats although missing 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.390
 seriously holding and you get a freeway in which it's good 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.030
 live 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.210
 a feeling that also applies to the rear seats in the space at 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880
 legs and roof guard are more than adequate 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.380
 among the little attentions we will remember the presence of series of two 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.980
 hours and lots for children 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.360
 finally the chest benefits from a particularly low loading threshold and 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.660
 with a capacity ranging from 499 to 1450 liters rear seat folded down 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.070
 equipped with 2 liters 4 diesel of 163 horses 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.230
 our high school sixty four wheel drive but not really the kind 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.240
 a little jostled 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.360
 on the contrary 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.399
 at the wheel, it's softness that's important 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.620
 and therefore 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.780
 because of his lack of cutting off his high weight he is anyway 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.919
 difficult to get a clear acceleration 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.109
 it is therefore necessary to anticipate overruns, especially when the family 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.189
 is complete 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.290
 our automatic transmission was more reactive 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.349
 which would encourage us to opt for the manual box charged 2000 euros 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.259
 cheaper 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.520
 finally with more than 3,300 km 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.700
 that is 219 grams of CO2 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.709
 our consumption is equivalent to that of a mercedes glk yet 60 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.099
 more powerful horses 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.719
 fortunately for the steering wheel will be next summer a two-wheeled version 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.739
 strong 175 horsepower plus coupleuse motor and no doubt the example of the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.309
 more ecological 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.410
 meanwhile take the xc60 to equip 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.469
 to know just contact excellent comfort 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.540
 for this purpose it is getting closer to more mercedes glk 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.459
 cuda audi q5 with more dynamic behavior 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.820
 remains the traditional strong point of volvo 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.279
 Security 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.679
 so besides his debauch dada driving the xc60 is the first 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.519
 vehicle in the world to be equipped as standard with a system capable of avoiding 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.629
 a collision with the other vehicle in the urban traffic 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.239
 christened city sexties the latter is acting under 30 kilometers an hour 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.860
 by automatically activating the braking system if no reaction 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.849
 is detected 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.799
 in the end with its 60 arrives on the suv and compact premium segment 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.659
 with serious arguments 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.549
 both comfortable and very safe 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.619
 it does not prevent that by the lack of vigor of its diesel engine 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.709
 nothing wrong on the other side tariffs 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.000
 risk regardless of the level of equipment 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.930
 Swedish were 10 to 15% cheaper 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.910
 than its German competitors
