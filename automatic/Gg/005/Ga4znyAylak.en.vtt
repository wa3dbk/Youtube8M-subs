00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
having a real strong isolation and

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.109 
having a real strong isolation and
really<00:00:23.830> sort<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.160> focusing<00:00:24.699> on<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.850> certain

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
really sort of focusing on a certain

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.180 
really sort of focusing on a certain
area<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.840> body<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.770> what<00:00:26.949> we're<00:00:27.100> gonna

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
area of the body so what we're gonna

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.810 
area of the body so what we're gonna
look<00:00:27.430> at<00:00:27.640> is<00:00:27.930> standing<00:00:28.930> with<00:00:29.140> our<00:00:29.170> feet<00:00:29.439> apart

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
look at is standing with our feet apart

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.549 
look at is standing with our feet apart
getting<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.880> good<00:00:31.090> grounding<00:00:31.539> and<00:00:31.750> then<00:00:32.409> we're

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
getting a good grounding and then we're

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.290 
getting a good grounding and then we're
going<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.710> use<00:00:32.769> the<00:00:33.309> upper<00:00:33.670> part<00:00:33.909> of<00:00:33.999> the<00:00:34.089> body

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
going to use the upper part of the body

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.110 
going to use the upper part of the body
to<00:00:34.539> create<00:00:34.899> that<00:00:35.409> that<00:00:35.920> power<00:00:36.249> but<00:00:36.909> the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
to create that that power but the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.700 
to create that that power but the
strength<00:00:37.569> is<00:00:37.749> going<00:00:37.929> to<00:00:37.989> come<00:00:38.229> from<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.499> legs

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
strength is going to come from the legs

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.619 
strength is going to come from the legs
so<00:00:39.339> we're<00:00:39.460> going<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:39.639> take<00:00:39.819> our<00:00:39.969> legs<00:00:40.120> low<00:00:40.389> and

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
so we're going to take our legs low and

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.599 
so we're going to take our legs low and
then<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.409> energy<00:00:41.559> comes<00:00:41.949> through<00:00:42.249> the<00:00:42.399> legs

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
then the energy comes through the legs

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.779 
then the energy comes through the legs
and<00:00:42.969> pops<00:00:43.870> at<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.199> top<00:00:44.409> and<00:00:44.859> what<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.399> means<00:00:45.609> is

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
and pops at the top and what it means is

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.340 
and pops at the top and what it means is
if<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:45.999> do<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.299> we<00:00:46.569> can<00:00:46.719> take<00:00:46.929> it<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.199> any

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
if we do that we can take it to any

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.829 
if we do that we can take it to any
dynamic<00:00:47.979> whether<00:00:48.699> it's<00:00:48.879> high<00:00:49.059> or<00:00:49.299> low<00:00:49.539> and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
dynamic whether it's high or low and

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.930 
dynamic whether it's high or low and
we're<00:00:50.199> using<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.589> legs<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.370> create<00:00:51.579> that<00:00:51.699> pop

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
we're using the legs to create that pop

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.819 
we're using the legs to create that pop
in<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.179> upper<00:00:52.329> chest<00:00:52.539> and<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.199> also<00:00:53.319> means<00:00:53.679> we

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
in the upper chest and it also means we

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.129 
in the upper chest and it also means we
can<00:00:53.979> incorporate<00:00:54.639> the<00:00:54.999> arms<00:00:55.420> we<00:00:55.959> can

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
can incorporate the arms we can

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.209 
can incorporate the arms we can
incorporate<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:57.339> head<00:00:57.579> we<00:00:58.059> can<00:00:58.269> pop<00:00:59.019> any<00:00:59.440> part

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
incorporate the head we can pop any part

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.500 
incorporate the head we can pop any part
of<00:01:00.719> our<00:01:01.719> body<00:01:01.780> legs<00:01:02.350> apart<00:01:03.300> we're<00:01:04.300> going<00:01:04.449> to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
of our body legs apart we're going to

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.320 
of our body legs apart we're going to
keep<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.840> bouncy<00:01:05.230> and<00:01:05.440> first<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.220> all<00:01:06.340> we're

keep it bouncy and first of all we're

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.560 
keep it bouncy and first of all we're
going<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.540> pop<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.650> chest
