00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.449
 I translated I decided to bring it all into 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 Video then what happens 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 I'll show you I started some things. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 here on the car put there five for 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.750
 six pages five pages that is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 only images so other two of text 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 I pressed your images to see the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.790
 participate in translating what happens 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 Let's go to the things that I got. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.150
 find out there at the time I got 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 translate third in a way 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.860
 consistent for the video and I will speak 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.020
 for you here then let's go 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.710
 the first thing I come to mention 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.170
 for you is the name of the update one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 name is on the screen but chris schott 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 that the guy had installed in the gt 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.710
 forbes.com link in editing you as 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.850
 Talk shit that I'm making up here. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 the name is there, it's here it's in me 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 and not the name of the business is mp tls what 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.750
 means I do not know is an acronym for 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.900
 something sure makes sense 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.960
 an update called this way nÃ© 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.179
 so this is it is enough can be 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.580
 of bread or anything like that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.000
 can be up to the acronym for a future 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.070
 should be the networks that is the topic that I 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.740
 I'll talk at that time, good. 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.510
 you must have seen those wars that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.040
 occurs in iraq etc. 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.760
 then a code has not been leaked there either 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.970
 business where the guys said to talk 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.950
 put it in the source code there and find a 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.940
 picture that picture showing 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.020
 At that moment, okay, that image and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.400
 helicopter 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.280
 this image is very similar or the same 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.590
 image is the same helicopter that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.380
 movie that will pass on the screen in this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.180
 moment that is a gta movie movie 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.850
 in case you do not know have the members of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 calm touch and if you're lucky 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.850
 It's going to be you end up watching the movie. 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.550
 trailer 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.250
 finally the business that will be there because 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.440
 of the film to mark with something of that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.440
 so the trailer is falling 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.989
 also does not approve the ocean and the bad is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.989
 clean 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:38.890
 the area is good you assemble the helicopter is 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:42.640
 just like the image or similar 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.760
 so much of things that details 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.299
 so let's say war and what happens 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.099
 huh 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.180
 this cut can come out because 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.159
 Rain we only have one helicopter 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.519
 go up detonate it this 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.109
 business is the right attack and that buza 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.310
 Helicopter can simply help 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.450
 You do the networks, yes, and one thing. 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.040
 help another 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.170
 was the only war thing that was 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 found in the game in the source codes and what 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:19.389
 the stronger the relationship between the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.900
 codes that were leaked between the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.300
 business of the helicopters is this training 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.669
 and if it looks like a clear helicopter 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.669
 This helicopter does not have a game until one 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.490
 monkey that the prey in the business has in the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.419
 and a helicopter is not a 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.669
 is great information if you will almost 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.740
 5% get off ok 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.780
 remembering the name mp of lf is an acronym 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.520
 We do not know how this one goes if you 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 You want me to put it in the comments. 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.240
 here below what this means 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.370
 For you was somehow part of the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.410
 year can be a pipe etc. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.330
 Okay, so I hope you have 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.039
 I like even a second part, I'm going 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.740
 try to produce less of it because it was 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.960
 that page there it is very difficult're 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:14.080
 thinking that the English think that the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.960
 Dutch disease tomtom also not 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.580
 What's the name of that fucking stick? 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.639
 thing like that 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.860
 prints there then I 'm trying 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.990
 translate the most because google 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.389
 translator does not translate image if you do not 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.880
 knows how to enter the business no longer 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.260
 have plenty of time available then lets 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.680
 I liked it underneath that video here. 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.970
 help a lot because 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.580
 it's not easy to drive this video is not 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.340
 Easy to open a topic like this and 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.169
 clearly say what will come out because 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.780
 what happens is beneficial by removing 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.039
 talking shit and that's what discourages 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.930
 youtube then let me stay here 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.840
