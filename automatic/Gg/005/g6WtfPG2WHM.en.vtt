00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
bottom tap it in with a hammer trying to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.580 
bottom tap it in with a hammer trying to

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
hold the camera at the same time here

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:36.129 
hold the camera at the same time here
hold<00:03:15.799> this<00:03:15.950> camera<00:03:23.799> over<00:03:24.799> here<00:03:27.489> okay<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:35.139> the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
hold this camera over here okay now the

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.770 
hold this camera over here okay now the
reason<00:03:36.170> we<00:03:36.650> had<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.859> notch<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.579> side<00:03:37.910> is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
reason we had to notch this side is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.740 
reason we had to notch this side is
because<00:03:39.680> there<00:03:40.250> was<00:03:40.370> too<00:03:40.549> much<00:03:40.730> metal<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.420> it

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
because there was too much metal and it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.460 
because there was too much metal and it
wouldn't<00:03:42.019> let<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.260> lay<00:03:42.590> into<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:44.389> web<00:03:44.660> see<00:03:45.349> you

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
wouldn't let it lay into the web see you

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.960 
wouldn't let it lay into the web see you
cut<00:03:45.709> 1/8<00:03:45.950> off<00:03:46.220> here<00:03:46.639> now<00:03:47.680> after<00:03:48.849> hold<00:03:49.849> this

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
cut 1/8 off here now after hold this

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.050 
cut 1/8 off here now after hold this
lightning<00:03:51.310> all<00:03:52.310> right<00:03:52.430> right<00:03:52.639> there<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.000> you

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
lightning all right right there so you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.589 
lightning all right right there so you
can<00:03:53.239> see<00:03:53.389> this<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.799> reason<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:55.250> cut<00:03:55.489> 1/8<00:03:56.329> inch

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
can see this the reason we cut 1/8 inch

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.909 
can see this the reason we cut 1/8 inch
off<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:57.049> here<00:03:57.349> is<00:03:57.549> because<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:59.389> knot<00:03:59.780> did<00:04:00.739> not

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
off of here is because this knot did not

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.500 
off of here is because this knot did not
have<00:04:01.190> enough<00:04:01.459> room<00:04:01.849> as<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.480> can<00:04:02.510> see<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:03.769> grab

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
have enough room as you can see to grab

the<00:04:05.510> plastic<00:04:06.169> locking<00:04:06.739> insert<00:04:07.609> in<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:08.060> nut<00:04:09.220> so

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
the plastic locking insert in the nut so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.719 
the plastic locking insert in the nut so
that's<00:04:10.579> why<00:04:10.759> I<00:04:10.790> cut<00:04:11.090> 1/8<00:04:11.359> off<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> top

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
that's why I cut 1/8 off at the top

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.580 
that's why I cut 1/8 off at the top
fitment<00:04:13.729> is<00:04:13.850> perfect<00:04:14.329> when<00:04:14.509> you<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:14.780> this

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
fitment is perfect when you do this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.159 
fitment is perfect when you do this
I<00:04:15.680> suggest<00:04:16.609> removing<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.329> rear<00:04:17.510> axle<00:04:17.989> from

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
I suggest removing the rear axle from

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.710 
I suggest removing the rear axle from
the<00:04:18.290> car<00:04:18.500> when<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:18.919> do<00:04:19.100> this<00:04:19.510> you'll<00:04:20.510> do<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.790 
the car when you do this you'll do a
better<00:04:20.810> job<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.709> you'll<00:04:22.430> never<00:04:22.610> destroy<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
better job and you'll never destroy the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.670 
better job and you'll never destroy the
rear<00:04:25.040> axle<00:04:25.639> by<00:04:26.600> putting<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.229> wrong<00:04:28.240> okay

now<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:31.449> got<00:04:32.449> qa1<00:04:32.840> coilovers<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.040> back<00:04:34.250> qa1

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
now I got qa1 coilovers in the back qa1

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.710 
now I got qa1 coilovers in the back qa1
traction<00:04:35.900> bars<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:37.430> all<00:04:38.030> PMT<00:04:38.720> fabrication
