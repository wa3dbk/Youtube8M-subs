00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.739
 today crisis 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.070
 hi to all guys and welcome in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 this new video tutorial 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.490
 today I'll show you the trick that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.770
 I realize when it really really does 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 hot and indeed as you can see o 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.550
 still wet hair but let's start 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.530
 immediately with the tutorial then I go to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.630
 treat my skin well using 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.070
 my usual state plunder cream 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.470
 sudden and I'm going to get it absorbed 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 very well dabbing it with the fingertips 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.010
 then moving on to eye makeup 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 I decide to go and rent this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 bronze colored pencil of debora su tutta 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 my eyelid, but in general 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 you can use the cream products 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.970
 of the color you prefer because they are 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 even more resistant then for the summer 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.660
 they are much more suitable than those 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 in powder I extend my pencil 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 plus it is waterproof in a way 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.910
 quite fast and use both i 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 fingertips but if you prefer you can 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 also use a bristle brush source 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.610
 to fade your strings precisely for 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.890
 spread the color I apply best 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.720
 also an intermediate brown for 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 get a wider nuance in the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.539
 eye crease and subsequently it goes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.399
 to light my arch 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.399
 eyebrow with a cream-colored mat 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.510
 now here we are 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.300
 once faded all is well I go to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.550
 apply only in the final part of the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.490
 my eye this but all super super 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.020
 black so as to go to outline the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.150
 shape of my eye but you can 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.860
 very well also use an eyeliner 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.750
 I in this case then use a 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.460
 angled brush to pull this 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.740
 pencil and also create a kind of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.240
 final tail that tends to raise the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.070
 line of my gaze and then to get me 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.860
 seem like a lot more elongated and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.960
 more sexy then I fold my eyelashes and goes by 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 use these false eyelashes of max 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.530
 quite natural because with everything 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.090
 I don't feel like going to this heat 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.430
 apply too much mascara on the lashes 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
 therefore while waiting for the glue for 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.910
 fake eyelashes dry step a 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.920
 what is the make-up of the face that 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.270
 however, it will always be very light 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.730
 in fact I'm not going to use a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.800
 foundation but I will use a concealer 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 covering enough to cover let's say 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.520
 in places where my skin is redder or 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.200
 where there are imperfections then 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.480
 I'm going to lay it under the eye sockets 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.640
 where or imperfections and subsequently 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.380
 I throw the concealer I applied in 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.390
 those areas all over the rest of the face 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.160
 because I don't want to weigh down the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.650
 my base of course if you are not 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 used to putting makeup on or bothering you 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.550
 make up when it's very hot you do n't 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.500
 the base or maybe just hang out 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.780
 a layer of powder in the area is then 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670
 in the area that shines most easily 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.890
 I personally prefer anyway 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.780
 go to standardize all my base e 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.150
 so I also use this foundation 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.650
 in powder or in any case a powder 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.380
 covering that allows you to remove 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 shiny in my area to make you uniform the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.920
 my complexion then fills mine 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.200
 eyebrows using an eye shadow or 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.050
 a pencil according to your taste e 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.140
 I'm going to fix them with a transparent gel 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.140
 Yup 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.540
 with a fairly cold land goes by 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.340
 sculpt my cheekbones and with a blush 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.500
 rosÃ© I'm going to make it fresher and more 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.300
 bright make up of my face like you 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 I said I didn't want to weigh down too much 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.860
 eyes using too much mascara but 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.660
 anyway I'm going to use this 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.269
 water resistant mascara of make up 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.400
 for ever on the upper eyelashes for 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.989
 to join them to false eyelashes and ne 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.630
 apply a veil also on the eyelashes 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.280
 lower to go frame mine 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.069
 eye like lipstick instead of decided 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.940
 use the beautiful marilyn of 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.910
 mulan 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.540
 there is a very much red strawberry color 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.430
 summer 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.680
 I really like using it without 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.019
 pencil because as you can see is super 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.790
 super resistant pigmented and goes to 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.470
 define perfectly the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.569
 outline of my lips term on 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.880
 make up going to make with nylon 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.040
 of max my light points on the eyes and 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.720
 on the face and also for today this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.849
 tutorial is finished 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.530
