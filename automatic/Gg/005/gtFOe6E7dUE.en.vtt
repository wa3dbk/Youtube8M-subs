00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 the staff is going to try to show you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.940
 now a hint also of how you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.490
 can see on your left alone is going 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 be a total of a recording I'm going to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 show you missing now after 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.300
 a second visual I'll show 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 result now for me a third 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.439
 class I'll show you trying 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 playing the ball with someone had a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.279
 sequence for you to train and try 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.279
 develop your left block 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.660
 First the most important is you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 know you have to be balanced to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 You hit the ball runs for nobody to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.440
 position I hope the super 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 balanced not only in my arm the party 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.210
 comfortable because what I'm going to try 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 I'll try to do what I did. 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.829
 Tragic day try to hit the ball in the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 front of the body to end the movement 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 After I hit the ball 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.300
 after I performed a movement of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.850
 tesco engagement of the ball direction 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.430
 then you correct the body back to the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 your place is the exercise would be more or 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 least the following no longer loose the ball and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:14.070
 hit the weight goes forward and then you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 come back to bring the ball loose and hit 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.909
 in her company forward 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.040
 Then you 're going to autograph the parish. 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.890
 I let the ball hit her because now 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 if you are facing the court 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.000
 You have to do what falls into it. 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.350
 position only you will use the steps 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.350
 adjustment that he looks at 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.710
 the point of your place I think justice 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:53.399
 go to the loose the ball hits it a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 blow low readjust was face hits her 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.610
 go ahead 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.479
 Old ottey 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.869
 I think the people who to you is about the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.510
 Good father rock 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.260
 however for detail after I hit 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.390
 on the ball 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.269
 my concern is not what 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.190
 now it 's going in the hallway 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.890
 I'm directing the ball to the consumer. 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.540
 so my body has to follow the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.450
 thing I correct aisle and back to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:43.080
 another ball is then observe prove that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:45.290
 five corridor area here in front of 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 front 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.890
 made to qualify the greatest movement 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.890
 just today the new tests watches 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:21.959
 moving in the race is the same thing 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.959
 of course comes the new steps for the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.959
 fact 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.960
 OK 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 note that this exercise to work 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.660
 with two things same time one of them is 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 You learn to hit the ball. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.070
 who would say that I know of the child 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.600
 ball and in the other one I know 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.670
 at the same time you are learning to 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.960
 Target the ball when you want to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.960
 if that would be what supporter 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.630
 in sequence and I go to that same 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.300
 exercise another visual is with someone 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.880
 dropping the ball to the front line 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.670
 after the third recording I tried 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.660
 hit the ball with someone using the same 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.130
 Hall 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.910
 the exercise you will learn to 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.010
 do what the canopy ends its blow 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.550
 learn to continue their strength to their 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.490
 body 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.490
 the one in order of legal preference
