00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.660 
in a therapy world a lot of people like
to<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.320> front<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> side<00:00:14.070> shoulder<00:00:14.460> raises

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
to do front and side shoulder raises

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.550 
to do front and side shoulder raises
when<00:00:15.599> they're<00:00:15.750> working<00:00:16.049> out<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> that's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
when they're working out and that's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
when they're working out and that's
great<00:00:17.119> but<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.360> times<00:00:18.570> people<00:00:18.779> have

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
great but a lot of times people have

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.630 
great but a lot of times people have
some<00:00:19.230> rotator<00:00:19.619> cuff<00:00:19.829> problems<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:20.520> may

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
some rotator cuff problems or they may

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
some rotator cuff problems or they may
have<00:00:20.669> some<00:00:20.849> challenges<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.899> doing<00:00:22.079> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
have some challenges with doing a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.850 
have some challenges with doing a
straight<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.520> lateral<00:00:24.090> raise<00:00:24.439> it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.649> little

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
straight out lateral raise it's a little

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.440 
straight out lateral raise it's a little
harder<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.309> the<00:00:26.430> shoulder<00:00:26.790> it's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.029> long<00:00:27.210> lever

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
harder on the shoulder it's a long lever

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.389 
harder on the shoulder it's a long lever
arm<00:00:27.809> so<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.770> reconditioning

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399

engage<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.470> scapula<00:00:47.040> then<00:00:47.820> we're<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
engage the scapula then we're going to

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.480 
engage the scapula then we're going to
lift<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.770> 45<00:00:50.220> degree<00:00:50.310> angle

shoulder height and back down and kind
of<00:00:54.300> repeat<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.900> motion<00:00:55.200> in<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> same<00:00:56.010> plane

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
of repeat that motion in that same plane

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.540 
of repeat that motion in that same plane
of<00:00:56.340> motion<00:00:56.610> nice<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> controlled<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.370> that's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of motion nice and controlled and that's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.610 
of motion nice and controlled and that's
going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.790> help<00:00:59.970> activate<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> super-spin

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
going to help activate the super-spin

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to help activate the super-spin
odds<00:01:01.800> muscle<00:01:02.310> if<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.570> easy<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
odds muscle if that's pretty easy and a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.899 
odds muscle if that's pretty easy and a
lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> times<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.070> throwers<00:01:05.579> it<00:01:05.759> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
lot of times there are throwers it is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
lot of times there are throwers it is
and<00:01:06.210> we'll<00:01:06.329> kind<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.600> advance<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.140> next

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and we'll kind of advance this next

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410 
and we'll kind of advance this next
activity<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> use<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.180> bit<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
activity which we use a little bit of a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.840 
activity which we use a little bit of a
combination<00:01:09.659> active<00:01:10.650> isotonic<00:01:11.340> exercise

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
combination active isotonic exercise

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.420 
combination active isotonic exercise
with<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.840> isometric<00:01:13.409> hold<00:01:13.620> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.190> kind<00:01:14.370> of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
with an isometric hold so I kind of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.820 
with an isometric hold so I kind of
demonstrated<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.440> consistent<00:01:16.440> path<00:01:16.620> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
demonstrated this consistent path to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
demonstrated this consistent path to
motion<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.940> they<00:01:18.060> excel<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
motion and they excel at that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.130 
motion and they excel at that
we'll<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.190> hold<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:21.780> we'll<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
we'll have them hold and now we'll do a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
we'll have them hold and now we'll do a
little<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.710> ladder<00:01:23.010> over<00:01:23.190> work<00:01:23.600> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
little you know ladder over work so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
little you know ladder over work so
we've<00:01:24.720> got<00:01:24.870> isometric<00:01:25.590> work<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> left

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
we've got isometric work on the left

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
we've got isometric work on the left
side<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> work<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.479> shoulder<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
side as I work the right shoulder and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
side as I work the right shoulder and
then<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.670> perform<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.780> again<00:01:31.080> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
then we can go and perform that again on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.070 
then we can go and perform that again on
the<00:01:31.260> other<00:01:31.470> side<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.479> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> nice

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
the other side so that's kind of a nice

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.800 
the other side so that's kind of a nice
way<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.770> work<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.760> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.150> progressed

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
way to work a little bit more progressed

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
way to work a little bit more progressed
