her been caged up through this tube and
I<00:00:47.000> have<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.420> tubes<00:00:47.630> on<00:00:48.230> these<00:00:48.470> boxes<00:00:48.920> because

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
I have the tubes on these boxes because

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.920 
I have the tubes on these boxes because
it<00:00:49.310> just<00:00:49.430> wasn't<00:00:49.760> strong<00:00:49.880> enough<00:00:50.060> to<00:00:50.300> hold<00:00:50.570> so

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
it just wasn't strong enough to hold so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.930 
it just wasn't strong enough to hold so
I<00:00:51.170> just<00:00:51.710> use<00:00:51.860> these<00:00:52.010> boxes<00:00:52.430> for<00:00:52.550> us<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.790> support

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
I just use these boxes for us to support

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.830 
I just use these boxes for us to support
and<00:00:53.350> then<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.680> comes<00:00:55.010> up<00:00:55.400> into<00:00:55.910> here<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.420> then

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
and then it comes up into here and then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.150 
and then it comes up into here and then
the<00:00:57.170> tubes<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.800> can<00:00:57.950> either<00:00:58.040> go<00:00:58.310> up<00:00:58.670> into<00:01:00.160> this

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
the tubes you can either go up into this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.850 
the tubes you can either go up into this
and<00:01:01.550> here<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.030> stuck<00:01:02.510> her<00:01:02.810> not<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.410> nibbler<00:01:03.739> if

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
and here I stuck her not to nibbler if

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.229 
and here I stuck her not to nibbler if

you didn't see that in the cage I put
that<00:01:05.269> there<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.979> then<00:01:07.090> if<00:01:08.090> she<00:01:08.740> she<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.859> go<00:01:09.979> to

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
that there and then if she she can go to

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.919 
that there and then if she she can go to
the<00:01:10.939> right<00:01:12.009> into<00:01:13.009> her<00:01:13.219> little<00:01:13.369> den<00:01:13.640> or<00:01:14.149> she

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
the right into her little den or she

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.989 
the right into her little den or she
could<00:01:15.049> go<00:01:15.229> straight<00:01:15.649> into<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.780> main<00:01:18.999> habitat

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
could go straight into the main habitat

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.679 
could go straight into the main habitat
so<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:21.920> she<00:01:22.130> has<00:01:22.310> her<00:01:22.609> ceramic<00:01:23.090> acorn<00:01:23.509> hub

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689

really<00:01:42.619> hard<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.979> put<00:01:43.189> this<00:01:43.340> together<00:01:43.579> but<00:01:44.030> I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
really hard to put this together but I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.919 
really hard to put this together but I

tubes<00:01:56.869> are<00:01:57.279> these<00:01:58.279> and<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:59.479> got<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.049> for<00:02:00.259> about

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
tubes are these and I got that for about

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.370 
tubes are these and I got that for about
ninety<00:02:01.279> dollars<00:02:01.429> all<00:02:02.119> brand<00:02:02.509> new<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.079> I<00:02:03.109> mean

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
ninety dollars all brand new so I mean

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.830 
ninety dollars all brand new so I mean
it<00:02:03.889> was<00:02:04.069> quite<00:02:04.429> a<00:02:04.459> bit<00:02:04.639> of<00:02:04.700> money<00:02:04.819> but<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.569> think

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
you'd probably pay more but this is just

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.380 
you'd probably pay more but this is just
