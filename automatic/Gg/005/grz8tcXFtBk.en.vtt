00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.720
 by the old school calls 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.870
 taught by the painter 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.870
 I do not know bright 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 we present a sample of works 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 made by the painter 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.110
 prepare our materials 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.380
 the palette of painter will try not to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.380
 be less than these measures 40 x 30 cm 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.460
 oil paintings 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.380
 the colors that we are going to present 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.660
 they are very similar to the primary ones and not 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.790
 they are enough to be able to put almost 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.080
 all the colors that we can observe 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.080
 In nature 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.440
 the reason for not presenting them in 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.140
 principle those closest to the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.630
 primary and neutral is due to the high 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 economic cost of some pigments 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.630
 how are the changes and cobalt before 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.990
 we must use these colors that you 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.990
 we propose 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.680
 light colors 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 medium yellow 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.680
 we replace them in principle with the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.680
 carmen yellow 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.810
 magento 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.560
 It is a violet red color 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.569
 ultramarine blue 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.150
 we also replace them for the moment 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.409
 by cobalt blue 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.409
 light colors 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.250
 let's move to neutral colors 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.660
 zinc white 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.019
 In principle, employment will be sufficient 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.019
 of this color 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.250
 black ivory 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.090
 with these names we will find them in 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.090
 drugstores and specialized stores 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.730
 oils 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.790
 we will use flaxseed oil we can 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.530
 also use raw flaxseed in 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.530
 drugstores you can find it 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.540
 dry tivo 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.100
 is a material that we should use with 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.100
 carefully rescindiremos 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.110
 wells and dispensers 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.510
 the wells is hardly used because they are 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.220
 many is why we're going to eliminate it 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.220
 and we replace it with the dispenser 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.170
 in brass or crystal base 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.550
 for cleaning our brushes 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.240
 and rags 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.139
 we present you only one to zeros of all 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.139
 What you may need 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.120
 turpentine 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.220
 Essential turpentine essence 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.570
 Brushes 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.730
 of bristle hair square or flat and 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:10.440
 they can also be shaped like a tongue 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:13.710
 of gas no min 4 6 10 12 and 14 numbers 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.410
 approximate we present ourselves also a 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.330
 similar that will be very useful 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.720
 also the sample of a brush of 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.230
 fan although it is not necessary for now 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.290
 easels can be found in the 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.640
 market of different shapes and sizes in 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.730
 ho ratchet table tripod 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.890
 etcetera if we do not have access to any 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.230
 from them you can also use the 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.980
 back of a chair like this we have 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.980
 started some 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.440
 remember that this course is aimed 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.320
 to those and those people who 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.680
 they start ruled by the old call 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.430
 Web 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.930
 yes we do not need an excess of material 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.930
 to carry out our work 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.900
 Any questions you have or question 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.540
 make us not hesitate to do so because 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.470
 we will try to solve them at the highest 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.470
 possible brevity 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.650
 greetings and until the next chapter
