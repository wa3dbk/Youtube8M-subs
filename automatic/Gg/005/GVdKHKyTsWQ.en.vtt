00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
Studios just revealed that there and I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.650 
Studios just revealed that there and I
saw<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.660> at<00:02:53.840> Comic<00:02:54.140> Con<00:02:54.170> an<00:02:54.680> optimist<00:02:55.130> Rhynie

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
saw this at Comic Con an optimist Rhynie

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.770 
saw this at Comic Con an optimist Rhynie
Grimlock<00:02:56.660> Satya<00:02:57.140> um<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.700> seems<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.299> Optimus

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
Grimlock Satya um it seems like Optimus

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.590 
Grimlock Satya um it seems like Optimus
is<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.170> little<00:03:00.590> bit<00:03:00.769> bigger<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:01.940> he<00:03:02.090> should<00:03:02.420> be

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
is a little bit bigger then he should be

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.210 
is a little bit bigger then he should be
I<00:03:02.630> thought<00:03:02.930> use<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> little<00:03:03.560> bit<00:03:03.650> smaller<00:03:03.980> -

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
I thought use a little bit smaller -

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370 
I thought use a little bit smaller -
Grimlock<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.450> doesn't<00:03:05.750> seem<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.230> in

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
Grimlock so it doesn't seem like it's in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
Grimlock so it doesn't seem like it's in
scale<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.830> paintwork

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
scale the paintwork

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.900 
scale the paintwork
is<00:03:07.900> decent<00:03:09.140> Grimlock<00:03:10.130> looks<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.519> lot<00:03:10.700> better

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
is decent Grimlock looks a lot better

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.390 
is decent Grimlock looks a lot better
than<00:03:10.970> Optimus<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.750> think<00:03:12.049> Optimus<00:03:12.950> especially

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
than Optimus I think Optimus especially

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.560 
than Optimus I think Optimus especially
around<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.700> face<00:03:13.910> could<00:03:14.209> be<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.330> lot<00:03:14.540> better

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
around the face could be a lot better

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.850 
around the face could be a lot better
and<00:03:16.330> it's<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:17.780> kind<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.170> disappointing

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and it's actually kind of disappointing

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.490 
and it's actually kind of disappointing
