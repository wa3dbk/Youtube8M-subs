00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.109 
okay now if you look at a mango you can
see<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> shape<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.840> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.189> whiter<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
see the shape it sort of is whiter this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
see the shape it sort of is whiter this
way<00:01:54.390> than<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> were

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
way than it is this way so if you were

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
way than it is this way so if you were
to<00:01:56.790> take<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.180> seed<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.719> figure<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to take this seed and figure out how it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.580 
to take this seed and figure out how it
goes<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.250> mango<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.079> think<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.380> see

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
goes into the mango I think you can see

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
goes into the mango I think you can see
that<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> goes<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.000> position<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.899> not

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that it goes in this position it's not

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
that it goes in this position it's not
gonna<00:02:04.259> go<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.680> position<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.490> see

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
gonna go in this position because see

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.560 
gonna go in this position because see
it's<00:02:05.790> whiter<00:02:06.060> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it's whiter here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's whiter here
alright<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> determine<00:02:08.940> how

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
alright so that's going to determine how

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.760 
alright so that's going to determine how
we<00:02:09.450> cut<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:11.400> gonna<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.670> cutting

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
we cut it so we're gonna be cutting

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.130 
we cut it so we're gonna be cutting
this<00:02:12.860> half<00:02:13.160> off<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.240> half<00:02:14.480> off<00:02:14.750> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
this half off and this half off and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
this half off and this half off and
those<00:02:15.680> are<00:02:15.830> called<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.190> cheeks<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.420> here<00:02:17.600> we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
those are called the cheeks so here we

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.440 
those are called the cheeks so here we
go<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.930> first<00:02:18.050> thing<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.450> slice

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
go the first thing I like to do is slice

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.320 
go the first thing I like to do is slice
off<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.320> bottom<00:02:21.940> hopefully<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.150> see

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
off the bottom hopefully you can see

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.170 
off the bottom hopefully you can see
this<00:02:23.420> right<00:02:23.540> I'm<00:02:23.660> gonna<00:02:23.750> cut<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.170> off<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:25.180> a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
this right I'm gonna cut this off just a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.640 
this right I'm gonna cut this off just a
little<00:02:26.390> bit<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.050> stand<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
little bit so that it can stand up and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.000 
little bit so that it can stand up and
be<00:02:28.040> straight<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.460> be<00:02:28.610> more<00:02:28.760> stable<00:02:29.060> now<00:02:30.010> this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
be straight and be more stable now this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.970 
be straight and be more stable now this
is<00:02:31.160> let<00:02:31.550> me<00:02:31.580> repeat<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.570> one<00:02:32.870> way<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.320> cut

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
is let me repeat this is one way to cut

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.970 
is let me repeat this is one way to cut
a<00:02:34.010> mango<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.580> not<00:02:34.760> necessarily<00:02:35.360> my<00:02:35.690> favorite

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
a mango it's not necessarily my favorite

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.620 
a mango it's not necessarily my favorite
I'll<00:02:36.980> show<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.610> little<00:02:37.760> bit<00:02:37.850> okay

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
I'll show you that in a little bit okay

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.990 
I'll show you that in a little bit okay
so<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.290> gonna<00:02:39.500> look<00:02:39.770> for<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> center<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
so I'm gonna look for the center of the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.090 
so I'm gonna look for the center of the
mango<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:41.930> top<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.350> fact<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.650> could<00:02:42.800> even<00:02:42.920> put<00:02:43.070> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
mango on top in fact I could even put a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.320 
mango on top in fact I could even put a
little<00:02:43.160> score<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.240> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
little score in there just to kind of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.720 
little score in there just to kind of
give<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> guideline<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.520> I'm<00:02:46.610> gonna

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
give you a guideline and then I'm gonna

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.600 
give you a guideline and then I'm gonna
go<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.270> half<00:02:47.360> an<00:02:47.660> inch<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.980> left<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
go about a half an inch to the left of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.280 
go about a half an inch to the left of
it<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.940> I'm<00:02:50.150> gonna<00:02:50.300> slice<00:02:50.690> down<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.330> slice

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
it and I'm gonna slice down and slice

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.650 
it and I'm gonna slice down and slice
off<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.710> cheek<00:02:54.980> look<00:02:55.250> at<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.460> now<00:02:56.180> I'm<00:02:56.330> I'm

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
off that cheek look at that now I'm I'm

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.910 
off that cheek look at that now I'm I'm
relatively<00:02:57.410> close<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:58.970> seed<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.770> then<00:03:00.890> I

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
relatively close to the seed so then I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.820 
relatively close to the seed so then I
want<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.130> turn<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> around<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.780> I'm<00:03:03.410> gonna<00:03:03.560> cut

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
want to turn it around and I'm gonna cut

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.300 
want to turn it around and I'm gonna cut
the<00:03:03.950> other<00:03:04.070> half<00:03:05.380> now<00:03:06.380> if<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.620> hit<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.070> seed

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the other half now if I hit the seed

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.950 
the other half now if I hit the seed
like<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:07.520> just<00:03:07.670> did<00:03:08.030> I'm<00:03:08.180> gonna<00:03:08.300> pull<00:03:08.630> my<00:03:08.660> knife

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
like I just did I'm gonna pull my knife

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.300 
like I just did I'm gonna pull my knife
out<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.260> little<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.800> go<00:03:09.920> around<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
out a little bit to go around it so you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.310 
out a little bit to go around it so you
can<00:03:13.520> see<00:03:13.760> here<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.840> sort<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.170> made<00:03:15.290> a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
can see here that I sort of made a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.920 
can see here that I sort of made a
little<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.740> of<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.730> know<00:03:16.760> an<00:03:17.120> indention<00:03:17.600> a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
little bit of a you know an indention a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.040 
little bit of a you know an indention a
curve<00:03:18.380> if<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.920> will<00:03:19.130> okay<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.720> there's<00:03:20.900> our

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
curve if you will okay so there's our

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.550 
curve if you will okay so there's our
seed<00:03:21.320> there<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.150> then<00:03:23.150> we're<00:03:23.510> gonna<00:03:23.630> cut<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
seed there and then we're gonna cut the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.070 
seed there and then we're gonna cut the
ends<00:03:24.980> off<00:03:25.130> by<00:03:25.580> doing<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:25.970> same<00:03:26.209> thing<00:03:26.540> only

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
ends off by doing the same thing only

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.630 
ends off by doing the same thing only
here<00:03:27.500> I'm<00:03:27.560> gonna<00:03:27.709> have<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:28.220> say<00:03:28.490> hit

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
here I'm gonna have to really say hit

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.270 
here I'm gonna have to really say hit
the<00:03:28.670> seed<00:03:28.910> right<00:03:29.150> away<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.160> then<00:03:31.160> I'm<00:03:31.250> just

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
the seed right away and then I'm just

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.660 
the seed right away and then I'm just
gonna<00:03:31.520> follow<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.270> seed<00:03:33.100> right<00:03:34.100> around<00:03:34.459> it

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
gonna follow that seed right around it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.460 
gonna follow that seed right around it
so<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.030> big<00:03:35.240> curb<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.600> I'm<00:03:35.900> cut<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.380> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
so it's a big curb that I'm cut I do the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.680 
so it's a big curb that I'm cut I do the
same<00:03:36.680> thing<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.040> other<00:03:37.130> side<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.640> lot<00:03:38.600> of

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
same thing with the other side a lot of

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.690 
same thing with the other side a lot of
people<00:03:38.959> they'll<00:03:39.200> take<00:03:39.440> their<00:03:39.800> cheek<00:03:40.280> they're

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
people they'll take their cheek they're

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.110 
people they'll take their cheek they're
part<00:03:41.030> here<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.560> make<00:03:42.560> cubes<00:03:42.980> out<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:43.790> I

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
part here and make cubes out of it so I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.370 
part here and make cubes out of it so I
don't<00:03:44.300> like<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.600> idea<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.840> holding<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.350> my

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
don't like the idea of holding it in my

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.260 
don't like the idea of holding it in my
hand<00:03:45.770> because<00:03:45.890> if<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.250> slip<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.820> knifes<00:03:47.030> gonna

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.290 
go through and cut me so I like to leave
it<00:03:48.830> down<00:03:49.010> on<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.459> cutting<00:03:49.640> board<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.150> that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
it down on the cutting board and that's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.030 
it down on the cutting board and that's
what<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.480> recommend<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:50.990> you<00:03:51.200> do<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:51.920> I'm<00:03:52.010> just

big<00:03:59.630> slices<00:04:00.080> or<00:04:00.260> thin<00:04:00.410> slices<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.100> then<00:04:01.910> I'm

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
big slices or thin slices and then I'm

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.570 
big slices or thin slices and then I'm
gonna<00:04:02.150> go<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.420> other<00:04:02.510> way<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.780> make<00:04:02.870> cubes<00:04:03.580> now

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
gonna go the other way to make cubes now

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.090 
gonna go the other way to make cubes now
once<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.910> have<00:04:04.940> all<00:04:05.150> your<00:04:05.180> cubes<00:04:05.660> sliced<00:04:06.320> then

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
once you have all your cubes sliced then

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.040 
once you have all your cubes sliced then
you<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.400> invert<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:07.910> can<00:04:08.090> push<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> inside

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
you can invert it you can push it inside

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.840 
you can invert it you can push it inside
out<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.620> looks<00:04:09.860> beautiful<00:04:10.370> right<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.580> mean

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
out and it looks beautiful right I mean

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.040 
out and it looks beautiful right I mean
to<00:04:10.970> me<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.209> almost<00:04:11.360> seems<00:04:11.660> like<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.930> could

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
to me that almost seems like you could

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.949 
to me that almost seems like you could
put<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.470> fruit<00:04:12.739> plate<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.870> know

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
put that on a fruit plate and you know

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.780 
put that on a fruit plate and you know
maybe<00:04:15.110> put<00:04:15.620> toothpicks<00:04:16.070> or<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.280> spoon<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.640> can

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
maybe put toothpicks or a spoon you can

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.640 
maybe put toothpicks or a spoon you can
scoop<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.239> up<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:17.630> can<00:04:17.810> take<00:04:18.020> a<00:04:18.049> knife<00:04:18.320> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
scoop it up and you can take a knife and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.380 
scoop it up and you can take a knife and
this<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.459> part<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.850> don't<00:04:19.910> like<00:04:20.180> so

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
this is the part that I don't like so

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.880 
this is the part that I don't like so
much<00:04:20.450> because<00:04:20.750> you're<00:04:20.989> dealing<00:04:21.140> with<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.470> curve

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
much because you're dealing with a curve

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.030 
much because you're dealing with a curve
and<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:23.360> kind<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:23.990> difficult<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.470> get<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.890> of

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
and it's kind of difficult to get all of

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.820 
and it's kind of difficult to get all of
the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.550 
the
go<00:04:26.099> out<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.819> basically<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:28.050> take<00:04:28.259> your<00:04:28.439> knife

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
go out but basically you take your knife

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.360 
go out but basically you take your knife
and<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.970> follow<00:04:30.449> along<00:04:30.780> carefully<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.740> you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and you follow along carefully and you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.700 
and you follow along carefully and you
cut<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.000> cubes<00:04:33.449> like<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.259> can<00:04:34.409> see<00:04:34.560> that

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
cut out the cubes like you can see that

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.230 
cut out the cubes like you can see that
I'm<00:04:34.800> doing<00:04:35.039> here<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.430> can<00:04:35.580> take<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.729> spoon<00:04:36.030> and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
I'm doing here you can take a spoon and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.839 
I'm doing here you can take a spoon and
do<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.419> same<00:04:36.599> thing<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.889> peel<00:04:41.189> my

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
do the same thing I like to peel my

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.320 
do the same thing I like to peel my
mangoes<00:04:42.599> first<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:44.610> reason<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.180> do

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
mangoes first and the reason that I do

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.670 
mangoes first and the reason that I do
I'm<00:04:45.659> going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> cut<00:04:45.960> off<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.259> bottom<00:04:46.560> piece

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
I'm going to cut off that bottom piece

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.399 
I'm going to cut off that bottom piece
again<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.270> did<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.629> other<00:04:48.659> way<00:04:48.930> but

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
again like we did it the other way but

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.700 
again like we did it the other way but
the<00:04:49.500> reason<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.009> peel<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.370> first<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:52.259> I

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
the reason I like to peel it first is I

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.860 
the reason I like to peel it first is I
like<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:52.949> just<00:04:53.099> get<00:04:53.370> as<00:04:53.639> much<00:04:53.909> I<00:04:54.240> like<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.629> leave

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
like to just get as much I like to leave

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.260 
like to just get as much I like to leave
as<00:04:54.990> much<00:04:55.020> fruit<00:04:55.409> behind<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.310> one<00:04:56.460> thing<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.909> I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
as much fruit behind for one thing and I

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.730 
as much fruit behind for one thing and I
just<00:04:57.509> like<00:04:57.659> to<00:04:57.780> get<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.020> out<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.319> way<00:04:58.409> to<00:04:58.469> me

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
just like to get it out of the way to me

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.430 
just like to get it out of the way to me
it<00:04:58.860> just<00:04:59.039> seems<00:04:59.219> easier<00:04:59.750> to<00:05:00.750> go<00:05:00.900> ahead<00:05:01.050> and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
it just seems easier to go ahead and

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
doesn't seem to work with the mango

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.610 
doesn't seem to work with the mango
especially<00:05:08.759> if<00:05:08.849> it's<00:05:08.969> really<00:05:09.270> ripe<00:05:09.509> it<00:05:10.379> just

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
especially if it's really ripe it just

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.100
