going to be focused they're going to

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.099 
going to be focused they're going to
shore<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.790> up<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.060> even<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.480> Griffin<00:03:42.750> doesn't

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
shore it up so even if Griffin doesn't

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.630 
shore it up so even if Griffin doesn't
come<00:03:43.230> back<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.100> know<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.400> better

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
come back and you know have a better

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.340 
come back and you know have a better
game<00:03:45.180> than<00:03:45.209> he<00:03:45.420> gave<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.750> first<00:03:46.019> two<00:03:46.200> I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
game than he gave in the first two I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.750 
game than he gave in the first two I
think<00:03:46.680> they<00:03:46.799> still<00:03:47.040> might<00:03:47.220> get<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.579> win<00:03:47.730> here

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
think they still might get the win here

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.580 
think they still might get the win here
those<00:03:48.359> are<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.540> two<00:03:48.720> factors<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.260> make<00:03:49.440> me

those are the two factors that make me

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.229 
those are the two factors that make me

to keep a very close eye on those
practice<00:04:04.859> reports<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:05.880> he's

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
practice reports not just if he's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.599 
practice reports not just if he's
practicing<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:07.049> if<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> media<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:08.010> that's

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609

assuming that the injury report that I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.350 
assuming that the injury report that I
checked<00:04:53.160> about<00:04:53.370> an<00:04:53.520> hour<00:04:53.670> ago<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.150> he<00:04:54.210> is

checked about an hour ago that he is

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.020 
checked about an hour ago that he is
going<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.750> be<00:04:54.840> fine<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.800> Bush<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.400> playing<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
going to be fine if Bush is playing and

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.840 
going to be fine if Bush is playing and
he's<00:04:57.450> healthy<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.170> bad<00:04:58.710> as<00:04:58.920> Washington's<00:04:59.640> been

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
he's healthy as bad as Washington's been

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.120 
he's healthy as bad as Washington's been
tackling<00:05:00.420> Bush<00:05:00.930> could<00:05:01.140> have<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> huge<00:05:01.860> game

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
tackling Bush could have a huge game

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.890 
tackling Bush could have a huge game
this<00:05:02.310> weekend<00:05:02.760> right<00:05:03.120> but<00:05:03.360> my<00:05:03.510> assumption

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
this weekend right but my assumption

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.450 
this weekend right but my assumption
when<00:05:04.140> I<00:05:04.200> see<00:05:04.410> tackling<00:05:04.830> issues<00:05:04.980> like<00:05:05.280> when<00:05:05.400> I

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
when I see tackling issues like when I

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.860 
when I see tackling issues like when I
see<00:05:05.610> tackling<00:05:05.970> issues<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.330> college<00:05:06.720> I

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
see tackling issues in college I

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.450 
see tackling issues in college I
sometimes<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.740> I'll<00:05:07.920> think<00:05:08.100> like<00:05:08.310> all

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
sometimes you know I'll think like all

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.950 
sometimes you know I'll think like all
right<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.940> defense<00:05:09.330> just<00:05:09.600> can't<00:05:09.780> get<00:05:09.900> it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
right that defense just can't get it

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.080 
right that defense just can't get it
done<00:05:10.200> but<00:05:10.350> with<00:05:10.500> an<00:05:10.620> NFL<00:05:11.100> defense<00:05:11.550> if<00:05:11.670> they

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
done but with an NFL defense if they

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.610 
done but with an NFL defense if they
have<00:05:12.210> tackling<00:05:12.660> issues<00:05:12.810> that's<00:05:13.350> something

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
have tackling issues that's something

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.350 
have tackling issues that's something
that<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.770> think<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:14.190> pretty<00:05:14.220> easily<00:05:14.730> remedy

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
that I think is pretty easily remedy

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.240 
that I think is pretty easily remedy
bull<00:05:15.600> you<00:05:15.960> know<00:05:15.990> from<00:05:16.500> week<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.830> week<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.100> mean

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.560 
bull you know from week to week I mean

make<00:05:23.070> big<00:05:23.220> improvements<00:05:23.730> from<00:05:23.790> week<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.120> week

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
make big improvements from week to week

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.810 
make big improvements from week to week
now<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.710> key<00:05:25.950> factors<00:05:26.370> that<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.580> look<00:05:26.790> for

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
now the the key factors that I look for

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.730 
now the the key factors that I look for
an<00:05:27.120> improvement<00:05:27.480> is<00:05:27.750> turnovers<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:28.500> think

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
an improvement is turnovers I think

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.740 
an improvement is turnovers I think
quite<00:05:28.890> often<00:05:29.160> turnovers<00:05:29.910> can<00:05:30.330> be<00:05:30.480> good

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
quite often turnovers can be good

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.170 
quite often turnovers can be good
fortune<00:05:31.230> bad<00:05:31.470> fortune<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.250> also<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.880> yards

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
fortune bad fortune and also the yards

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.180 
fortune bad fortune and also the yards
per<00:05:33.360> point<00:05:33.630> on<00:05:33.960> offense<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.470> defense<00:05:34.919> when<00:05:35.160> a

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
per point on offense and defense when a

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.520 
per point on offense and defense when a
team<00:05:35.460> has<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.970> very<00:05:36.480> good<00:05:36.600> yards<00:05:37.169> per<00:05:37.350> point

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
team has a very good yards per point

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.310 
team has a very good yards per point
statistic<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.550> bad<00:05:39.000> turnovers<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:40.169> know<00:05:40.260> I

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
statistic and bad turnovers you know I

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.930 
statistic and bad turnovers you know I
look<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:40.710> team<00:05:40.890> with<00:05:41.010> bad<00:05:41.190> turnovers<00:05:41.730> they're

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
look for team with bad turnovers they're

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.460 
look for team with bad turnovers they're
the<00:05:42.030> ones<00:05:42.210> that<00:05:42.300> had<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.570> biggest<00:05:42.720> upside<00:05:43.169> and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
the ones that had the biggest upside and

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.550 
the ones that had the biggest upside and
teams<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.460> have<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:45.330> know<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.630> great<00:05:46.140> yards

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
teams that have you know a great yards

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.990 
teams that have you know a great yards
per<00:05:46.710> coin<00:05:46.950> statistic<00:05:47.430> there<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.730> teams<00:05:47.940> that

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
per coin statistic there the teams that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.430 
per coin statistic there the teams that
have<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.300> biggest<00:05:48.510> downside<00:05:49.080> now<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.290> think

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
have the biggest downside now I think

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.860 
have the biggest downside now I think
tackling<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.700> really<00:05:51.120> says<00:05:51.360> something<00:05:51.390> about

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
tackling it really says something about

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.690 
tackling it really says something about
their<00:05:52.200> lack<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:52.410> fundamentals<00:05:53.130> yes<00:05:53.370> you're

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
their lack of fundamentals yes you're

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.400
