00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.730

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.469
 same very well here and matías many 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 thank you and I insist on agreeing to speak 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.440
 with us there are several issues the case of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.000
 diego kings what status is in this 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.850
 Matías moment 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.440
 good god is 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 we entered at this moment with the 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.960
 selection that they have now a match in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.870
 the afternoon I this week is doing 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 for contributed to see a little bit of the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.450
 plans that the club has for him already 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 from there to determine what is the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 better alternative both for contributed as 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 for video if it is to continue at all 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.530
 that he is on loan for a season so 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 we will probably do them for the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 next week for next week it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.909
 will define the future there is no uneasiness 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 on the part of a football is being 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.360
 concentrated with the selection that at 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.220
 better have to change equipment like 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.550
 this situation is handled to you is like 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.409
 how do you enter and the representative to 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.930
 reassure things and be 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 negotiating there are several options you get 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.500
 with English 6 is that I have no offer of 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.909
 this of this and this and this or 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.859
 really until something is consolidated 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.469
 the reality is that there is no uneasiness 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.490
 by the fact that I say today has a 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:28.009
 club and a club that wants it is not that 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.770
 do not have a club or are looking for your future 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.310
 or that your club does not want it then in 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.470
 That sense, he said, is quiet 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.020
 if he wanted to have more anticipation and is 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.020
 abnormal from anybody but that's why the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.829
 idea to join with them to see what is the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.470
 plans and from there determine which 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.940
 would be the best option for videos and if 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.370
 there is effectively 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.630
 in case the best alternative is 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.090
 be out 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.189
 Diego has several possibilities 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 the future of the Andes in football 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.590
 Italian in French football and also 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.509
 in Spanish completely discarded or 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.729
 matías that could come to mexico because 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.980
 I suppose there will be teams that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 they would want here 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.110
 clearly there was here because they want 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.740
 they did not call us at a given time to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.830
 Yes now 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.440
 if he would be alive interested in returning 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.480
 but the reality is that at this moment 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 he is not interested in continuing his 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.500
 race in europe is still young and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.230
 We believe that very soon for 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.900
 so that he returns matías by in the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.870
 evaluation that you and you do 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.060
 represented are we the family that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.090
 also in these cases it is fundamental 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 of what Diego has lived in this time 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.200
 in europe I mean they expected a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.989
 little bit more exposure 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.390
 is what they had calculated because the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.129
 player I effectively say for us 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.319
 as Mexicans, it is very clear that 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.629
 has done they are very attentive but maybe 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.239
 has not shone so much according to the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.670
 conditions that you have in that market and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.970
 it's not so easy that suddenly I can 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.970
 go out 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.459
 The reality is that the jump to Europe 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.239
 one always has to grow 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.180
 sportingly speaking I think it's a 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.549
 good person and personally he is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.090
 maturing but in the professional aspect 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.730
 neither should we forget that the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.180
 last year for example who was 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.829
 playing outside operas was the central most 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
 expensive of all the stories to come 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.250
 the manchester city was coming the year 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.290
 previous was otamendi 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.480
 that today they play valencia holder of the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.430
 Argentine selection and if it comes out sergio 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.620
 is the candidate then the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.880
 competition that he said he also had in a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.030
 moment of the year are a competition 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.090
 important and good diego maybe he did not have 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.959
 the participation he had in Mexico but 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.870
 good 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.840
 being there grew a lot that what 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.510
 sportingly and not for nothing there are teams 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.380
 from different leagues that are interested 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.329
 in hiring him and good still at the end of 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.680
 accounts the future of risk is 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.600
 season is not being in ports 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.520
 have the opportunity to continue playing 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.860
 in Europe because there are teams that are 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.560
 interested then there are other teams 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.560
 who believe 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.770
 matías how it should be defined 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.250
 We know that the European market is 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.690
 open still several more weeks and 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.490
 your rights being owned by a 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.639
 equipment like the port that is handled very 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.560
 well in the European market what would be 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.990
 like the things that are going to be evaluated 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.530
 because here the money does not matter so much 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.340
 if not where can I die if it is the case if 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.440
 will come out 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.240
 develop for your soccer where 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.400
 I could receive more in more options you 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.990
 you participate in that type of discussions or 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.990
 the porto solves them completely 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 good 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.140
 and he heard us but we do not 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.340
 we listen matias I do not know if you're 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.390
 hearing he is cutting himself 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.220
 communication there you hear us matías no 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.520
 is that we do not listen to you to see if you want 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.470
 already 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.930
 yes good at the end of the account is a 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.870
 clearly shared decision the port 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.900
 owns the rights and will have its 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.509
 weight in this sense but at the end of 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.449
 accounts diego who in a moment if 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.759
 had to move can also 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.310
 have their preferences and good has to 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.379
 to make an analysis let's say mature to the 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.360
 time to make a decision not only 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.270
 because I like to live in a city 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.229
 I want to play on that team but where 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.330
 he can grow sportingly more and with 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.620
 the positive or negative things that 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.090
 can get to have to talk the same 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.120
 language of not talking about it being a 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.099
 more favorable climate than another I think that in 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.699
 this case we are not preponderating in 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.550
 this type of variables but where 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.550
 Diego could use more 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.550
 sportingly
