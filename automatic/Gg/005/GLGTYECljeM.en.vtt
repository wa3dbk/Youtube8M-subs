00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.349
 in this lesson we will study the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.840
 way of turning a compost pile a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.860
 times the pile of compost built this one is going 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.990
 rise in temperature 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 sign that the decomposition process 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 is working 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.960
 after a few weeks the temperature 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.109
 of the pile will drop the decomposition 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
 will then be slowed down so you can 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.939
 turn the pile to reactivate the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.740
 decomposition process allowing 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.740
 to get compost faster 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 to turn the compost we will have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.809
 need four wooden poles of a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:51.090
 fork spade from a hand fork of a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 fork of a means of irrigation and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.449
 branches and penalty started by scoring 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.780
 the place where the pile will be held 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.070
 return using wooden poles 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 this will also serve us to mount 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.570
 a straight pile practice a digging at 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 the chosen place 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 this will improve drainage and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.860
 will facilitate the absorption of nutrients 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.860
 by the ground 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.350
 if you wish you can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 weed the surface where the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 city ​​using the hand forks 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.180
 this step is optional water the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.400
 surface and placed the branches and peace 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.400
 about 5 to 10 cm thick 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.170
 the surface is now ready 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 we will start to return the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.500
 stack start by moving the top of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 the pile we see that this part is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 still intact it is easy to recognize 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.310
 the plants placed below the new 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.479
 heap they will find the best 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.679
 conditions to decompose 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.300
 properly watered regularly so 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.750
 to bring the moisture needed for 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.759
 activate the decomposition does the same 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.060
 with the plant material located on the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.060
 sides 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.890
 we can observe here that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.200
 plants in the center of the pile are 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.989
 already well broken down they are 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.489
 hardly recognizable try to 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.980
 place them on the edges of the new heap 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:36.349
 and to place the plants not to decompose 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 in the center trying to keep the compost 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.310
 well straight and well squares in order to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.310
 promote uniform decomposition 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:00.709
 replace the overflowing plants 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:03.140
 inside the floor under the pile 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.880
 of origin will be very fertile it will only be 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 so no need to add compost 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.410
 at this place for the next crop 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.120
 gather the remaining materials is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.120
 completed by watering
