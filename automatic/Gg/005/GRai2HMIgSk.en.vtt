 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.899
 channel video I know we like it a lot 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 this kind of videos but I do not care 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.820
 I need to record this is going to come out in 5 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 minutes the new trailer and last of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 sense jo part 2 this comes to an end 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 this is going to end and the truth is that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 I 'm dying to see it but not 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 I want to see it because it is already the end 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.969
 it ended forever and the truth is that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 I'm very excited with the trailer 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.760
 I'm super excited with the movie and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 I think it's going to be better than burning and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 look at that fire I think it's 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.960
 insuperable 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.450
 to see if it comes out and the trailer 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.120
 and see how it is, I will not be able to 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.590
 teach the images but I'm going to 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 leave the audio if I have a problem 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.629
 he did not monetize it and they were already taken out 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.730
 I do not care what audio I'm going to leave 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.670
 because if it does not have no hint of grace 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.059
 and in the box description below down here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.830
 I'll leave the link to the trailer and if when 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.040
 has gone up is already in Spanish then 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.990
 I leave the link below in Spanish so that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.770
 so you understand it better by any 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.920
 It's worth a dark minute 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.440
 my heart a thousand per hour right now 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.160
 my god I stop refreshing the page 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.509
 from youtube look at twitter to see it 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.470
 from the first place they hang it 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.640
 I know it's worth 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.910
 I'm deranged now I say I'm 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.390
 dying there's nothing left a minute and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.390
 half 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.399
 this trailer I'm going to die so I had 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.880
 that touching the heart right now is going to 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.000
 get out of my little body worth my mother is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.000
 15 are already 55 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 this one is 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.470
 the breath breathed from it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.680
 good 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.810
 here we go 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.190
 and that luck is always of our 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.730
 part 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 Y 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.870
 Y 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.630
 so I feel 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.459
 we talked a little bit about that mind once 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.670
 while his hand of the moment 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.670
 the same with this decade 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.290
 i 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.140
 the world 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.080
 favorite 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.370
 yes 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.370
 for now but realities of people 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.370
 anyone 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.050
 climbing people 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.050
 and so much 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.780
 do not 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.029
 of everything 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.659
 I do not like 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:05:00.319
 to use the wait and two leave 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:00.319
 worlds parachutes come out 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.390
 I'm dying but I'm going to 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:13.150
 see again because the dead has been 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.150
 spectacular in the cinema 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.189
 I can not even speak I swear 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.599
 so I still did not assume this because it's that 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:27.979
 the haber or the meat appointment end and a print 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.979
 everything comes out 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.590
 last words mother 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.319
 I do not know I can not react badly so 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.740
 I'm going to watch it again here the video 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.379
 from today 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.080

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.080

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.100
