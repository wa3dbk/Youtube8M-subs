00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
said the makeup as well because it's a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.339 
said the makeup as well because it's a
combination<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> powder<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
combination of the powder and the

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.509 
combination of the powder and the
blusher<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:31.220> really<00:02:31.489> very

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
blusher but it's not really very

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.490 
blusher but it's not really very
pigmented<00:02:32.030> blusher<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:33.349> might

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
pigmented blusher so I really might

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.300 
pigmented blusher so I really might
prefer<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.090> setting<00:02:35.090> powder<00:02:36.310> now

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
prefer it as a setting powder now

prefer it as a setting powder now

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
is the whole kind of a theory that we're

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.690 
is the whole kind of a theory that we're
working<00:02:50.810> here<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.980> what<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.519> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
working here and what you do with this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.020 
working here and what you do with this
it's<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.390> nice<00:02:54.170> flesh<00:02:54.950> colored<00:02:55.459> pencil

and<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.750> put<00:02:57.200> this<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.489> lower

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
and you put this in to the lower

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.849 
and you put this in to the lower
waterline<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:01.930> I've<00:03:02.930> curled<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.380> eyelashes

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
waterline so I've curled this eyelashes

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.170 
waterline so I've curled this eyelashes
and<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.010> put<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.489> cheat<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:04.880> know<00:03:05.090> I'm

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and I put that I cheat you know I'm
