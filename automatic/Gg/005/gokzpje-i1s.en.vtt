00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.510 
will raise and lower those carousels so
that<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.060> shuttle<00:02:52.560> grippers<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.920> pick<00:02:54.280> them

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
that the shuttle grippers can pick them

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.360 
that the shuttle grippers can pick them
and<00:02:54.790> place<00:02:55.420> them<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.290> crucible<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.980> key

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and place them on the crucible the key

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.190 
and place them on the crucible the key
to<00:02:57.520> this<00:02:57.640> system<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.450> simplicity<00:02:58.690> in

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
to this system is the simplicity in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.250 
to this system is the simplicity in
design<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.940> lack<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.160> complex<00:03:03.160> movements

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
design and the lack of complex movements

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.650 
design and the lack of complex movements
basically<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.680> up-down<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.640> rotations<00:03:07.360> in

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
basically it's up-down and rotations in

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.620 
basically it's up-down and rotations in
a<00:03:08.200> simple<00:03:08.620> shuttle<00:03:09.070> from<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.640> carousels

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
a simple shuttle from the carousels

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.320 
a simple shuttle from the carousels
to<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> pedestal<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.070> back<00:03:12.580> with<00:03:13.180> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
to the pedestal and back with the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.780 
to the pedestal and back with the
removal<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.900> system<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.610> would

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
removal of the system with that I would

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.970 
removal of the system with that I would
like<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.090> thank<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.540> my<00:03:17.110> name<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.350> Aaron<00:03:17.830> Walsh

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
like to thank you my name is Aaron Walsh
