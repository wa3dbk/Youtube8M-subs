00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.610
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.130
 I bring you a little trick here in the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.990
 minecraft of the ps3 and well this for 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.360
 that will serve to deactivate 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.310
 minecraft updates and so 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.250
 be able to do all the tricks that are 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.460
 patched according to the version 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.460
 115 okay okay this has a catch 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.680
 and is that you can not online so that 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.420
 is the only downside that I see and well what 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.730
 you have to do previously is to eliminate 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.230
 the game completely whole and now what 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.110
 what you have to do is come to the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.290
 store to your account where you have the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.840
 minecraft bought in agreement you are going to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.620
 the download list and what you do 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.190
 Now first, download the theme of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 minecraft according 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 note well that you have the demo and the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.940
 activation below because with the demo 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.729
 Well, this would be doing something silly 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.650
 okay, what you have to do 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.570
 basically lower the dome first like 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.409
 I said there we have it already installing 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.270
 and downloading completed completely 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 well also now you download the file 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 of activation since if you do not get the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.990
 candadito and you can not play at 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.690
 video game basically agree that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 good once installed and what you have 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 what to do is to leave completely and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.929
 check that you have the game well 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 installed how do you do this as well as you 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.850
 I said if you have not activated it well 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 then we will get the iconic padlock 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 if using the lock icon is that what 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 you have done badly good before anything is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.940
 to close session because if we do not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.700
 will ask to update anyway 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.830
 now I will teach how to stay then 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.200
 no connection is valid so it does not ask us 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.090
 update and good here I buy vice 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.680
 since the game is well worth as you see 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.660
 there does not have the candadito or anything what 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.250
 I have in full version it's worth very 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.960
 important that because if you have not 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.810
 downloaded bad and good what you have to 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.510
 do now is if the network settings 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.820
 Internet connection and press disable 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.850
 so there is no connection to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.690
 good agreement internet once done 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.540
 this already starts the game and you create a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.220
 new departure according as well here 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.100
 you will see I have already created a game in the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.250
 creative mode and I teach you a trick that 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.290
 I was patched in good agreement this 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.840
 trick is to put on as you have 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.430
 seen at the beginning of the video 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.560
 any cube in the head according 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.090
 It's a pretty cool trick about everything 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.470
 to do it in good agreement too 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.050
 as they have patched also the tricks of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.810
 duplicate some duplicate trick and so on 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.520
 or especially the duplicate rail tracks 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.380
 and all that can be done again without 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 no problem according what happens 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.270
 that you will not have the update and if the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.820
 update 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 there will be no horses, there will be no things 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.140
 they have agreed new and good 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.030
 to do this trick if you want I leave you 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.300
 in the description I will leave the tutorial 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.980
 since it will serve you in agreement because 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.590
 you have deleted all the updates 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.600
 and good if you want to go back to the game 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.970
 normal you will simply have to go back to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.620
 activate internet get into the game and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.630

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.500
 update and you are already have the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.880

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.250

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.830

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.600
