00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.339
 Welcome to the year with wanted 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.140
 a new video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.849
 something like that you have a little swing 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.219
 mistakes made but first of all 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.219
 First of all, these are high 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.829
 this beautiful day 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.379
 The thing is called sad we do 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.699
 today the surface mounting and the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:01:00.670
 Here you need it once so needs 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:03.670
 Of course, you 're saddened by that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.979
 I now can also zwÃ¶lfer mist 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.259
 perfectly okay comes on warm water 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.750
 fishes your hold were taken or so 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.090
 have to be a bit bigger 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.869
 so if a made takes are pay 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.789
 a bit smaller 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.210
 The main thing that does not understand the hard 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.479
 so how do we start we need that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.610
 Dare as I said I have the montage 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.899
 taken from the last time 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.330
 hereby triple hook hook 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.220
 we can just leave it that way 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.420
 as well fish with pond so as well 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.979
 then feel swirl 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.490
 I have not stopped yet 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.350
 I'm sorry 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.979
 but they probably come in 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.619
 next video and then hold still 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.450
 Hauptschule how do I do that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.640
 That's relatively easy to assemble 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 That's why I have you too 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.629
 still a little more for this episode 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.519
 So other stuff scheduled as mach 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:12.330
 me that my main school because that dares 

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:16.690
 Eck hit no matter in which direction 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.390
 there is no rule or no measure 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.379
 so now we would have the whole thing like that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.510
 now directly below the surface 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.769
 this is how it works 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.989
 but who is now very fine tables 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.120
 and fish directly under the surface 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.209
 I want was once just a small 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.860
 gadget or a small part of what i did 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.680
 mostly in front of everyone else 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.060
 so in masses 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.659
 have something in front of me here 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:03:01.730
 manager here so what does that look so 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:03:04.250
 a very old box with here in 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.959
 different things here either so 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.030
 What 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 these are buoyant beads with these 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:19.159
 we can stop buoyancy very much 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.049
 well there we can very fine that 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.340
 adjust the whole and see how far it is 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.120
 under the clock under the surface 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.230
 should stand there so we are here now 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.620
 say about always we are in now 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.969
 summer and have the trout about 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.219
 20 centimeters below the surface is 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:39.579
 but I have to imagine 70 centimeters 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:43.840
 simply that's what the pearl is like here 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:48.109
 either you can push through it 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.260
 what's the case here but what 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.079
 not always so good because 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.400
 then just stop sliding around freely 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.430
 so you take another 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.799
 I take a nice red here nice 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.599
 red rether this is a very nice bread 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.549
 only sometimes the problem is that you 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.269
 above all stop attacking the things 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.659
 so now I'm doing this here 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.609
 you can say that even if you are 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.359
 with a needle or as here i have 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.609
 always like a needle for something like that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.759
 fine but one straight is natural 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.090
 also possible because at noon we get that 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.710
 whole course better than with 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.060
 but if I'm right now 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.169
 not to handle differently namely 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.330
 mostly the sun 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.570
 and if you are not so different as that 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.729
 I just then one is stuck 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.580
 No, I have to look right there 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.560
 then you can easily continue the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.560
 make things 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.509
 but you can do it that way 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.210
 I'll show you the worst now 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.360
 variant but also what works 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.639
 which is not necessarily bad right now 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.430
 if he has the hook here now then 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.629
 he takes every hook like that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.550
 not in the field of view of you 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:06.779
 Again he puts the hook here 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.419
 one did that then he realized that that 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:12.360
 he bends around here a bit 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.430
 ever in the styrofoam that is so 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.639
 a small styrofoam balls has he 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:22.710
 come in and then exit again 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.580
 we have so here is so hard 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.379
 beaten 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.379
 and now out
