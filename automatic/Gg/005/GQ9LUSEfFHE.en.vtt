00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.800 
vegetables that you buy in season are
much<00:03:59.670> cheaper<00:03:59.880> than<00:04:00.240> when<00:04:00.420> they're<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:00.780> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
much cheaper than when they're out of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.540 
much cheaper than when they're out of
season<00:04:01.110> because<00:04:01.470> they're<00:04:01.800> obviously<00:04:02.310> more

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
season because they're obviously more

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.210 
season because they're obviously more
abundant<00:04:03.060> during<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.630> time<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:05.070> can

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
abundant during that time so you can

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.890 
abundant during that time so you can

a couple really the cheaper fruits or

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.990 
a couple really the cheaper fruits or
deals<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.410> week<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.520> do<00:04:20.640> all<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.790> these

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
deals that week if you do all of these

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.940 
deals that week if you do all of these
things<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.570> think<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.680> safe<00:04:22.890> to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
things and I think it's pretty safe to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.600 
things and I think it's pretty safe to
say<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.460> could<00:04:23.670> live<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:25.610> very

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
say that you could live on a very

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.540 
say that you could live on a very
healthy<00:04:26.940> vegan<00:04:27.780> diet<00:04:28.230> for<00:04:28.740> less<00:04:29.190> than<00:04:29.340> five

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
healthy vegan diet for less than five

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.970 
healthy vegan diet for less than five
dollars<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> day<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.410> can<00:04:31.530> probably<00:04:31.740> even

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
dollars a day and you can probably even

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.860 
dollars a day and you can probably even
get<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.400> down<00:04:32.550> lower<00:04:32.820> than<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.570> five

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
get it down lower than that but five

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.260 
get it down lower than that but five
dollars<00:04:34.170> is<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:35.070> pretty<00:04:35.610> good<00:04:35.760> amount<00:04:36.000> you're

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
dollars is a pretty good amount you're

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.690 
dollars is a pretty good amount you're
already<00:04:36.630> spending<00:04:36.890> less<00:04:37.890> than<00:04:38.220> what<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.610> would

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
already spending less than what it would

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700 
already spending less than what it would
cost<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:39.060> get<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.300> whole<00:04:39.540> meal<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.140> fast-food

cost to get a whole meal at a fast-food

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.980 
cost to get a whole meal at a fast-food
restaurant<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.460> definitely<00:04:42.240> less<00:04:42.540> than<00:04:42.780> at

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
restaurant and definitely less than at

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.160 
restaurant and definitely less than at
any<00:04:43.050> other<00:04:43.320> restaurant<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> five<00:04:45.780> dollars

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
any other restaurant so five dollars

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.360 
any other restaurant so five dollars

last you four or five days depending on

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:31.209 
last you four or five days depending on
you<00:05:28.039> know<00:05:28.069> how<00:05:28.369> much<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.580> eat<00:05:29.860> how<00:05:30.860> much<00:05:31.009> how

you know how much you eat how much how

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:33.969 
you know how much you eat how much how
many<00:05:31.279> calories<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.909> need<00:05:31.939> to<00:05:32.149> eat<00:05:32.300> but<00:05:32.979> case

many calories you need to eat but case

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.320

and so if i divide the $27 by for the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.809 
and so if i divide the $27 by for the
seat<00:05:42.110> that's<00:05:42.409> a<00:05:42.740> little<00:05:42.979> over<00:05:43.189> six<00:05:43.399> dollars
