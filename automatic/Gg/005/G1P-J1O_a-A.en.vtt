show<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.500> we're<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.100> concentrate

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
show you is we're going to concentrate

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.160 
show you is we're going to concentrate
on<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.180> first<00:01:55.390> inch<00:01:55.659> because<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:56.050> you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
on just this first inch because if you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.290 
on just this first inch because if you
can<00:01:56.320> learn<00:01:56.800> one<00:01:57.100> inch<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.640> starts<00:01:57.909> over

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
can learn one inch it just starts over

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.940 
can learn one inch it just starts over
again<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.080> next<00:01:59.200> inch<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.619> if<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.800> can

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
again for the next inch so if you can

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.460 
again for the next inch so if you can
learn<00:02:00.100> how<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.700> read<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.180> scale<00:02:01.509> you'll<00:02:02.290> be

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
learn how to read this scale you'll be

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.370 
learn how to read this scale you'll be
fine<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.100> first<00:02:03.369> inch<00:02:03.930> again<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
fine this is the first inch again the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.080 
fine this is the first inch again the
top<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.770> scale<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.310> thirty<00:02:06.520> seconds<00:02:07.000> of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
top of the scale is in thirty seconds of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.969 
top of the scale is in thirty seconds of
an<00:02:07.180> inch<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.690> bottom<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.320> sixty<00:02:08.649> fourths

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
an inch the bottom is in sixty fourths

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.430 
an inch the bottom is in sixty fourths
so<00:02:09.610> let's<00:02:09.789> keep<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> basic<00:02:10.360> here<00:02:10.810> we<00:02:11.080> know<00:02:11.230> this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
so let's keep it basic here we know this

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.560 
so let's keep it basic here we know this
long<00:02:11.830> line<00:02:12.160> here<00:02:12.190> represents<00:02:13.000> that's<00:02:13.209> an<00:02:13.420> inch

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
long line here represents that's an inch

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.560 
long line here represents that's an inch
from<00:02:13.810> here<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.410> here<00:02:15.269> first<00:02:16.269> thing<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.540> should

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
from here to here first thing we should

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.060 
from here to here first thing we should
just<00:02:16.840> learn<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.230> how<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> divide<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:17.950> into

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
just learn is how to divide it up into

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.990 
just learn is how to divide it up into
quarters<00:02:19.680> 1/4<00:02:21.390> 2/4<00:02:22.390> which<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.630> 1/2<00:02:23.550> 3/4<00:02:24.550> once

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
quarters 1/4 2/4 which is 1/2 3/4 once

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.090 
quarters 1/4 2/4 which is 1/2 3/4 once
if<00:02:25.300> they<00:02:25.720> make<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> easy<00:02:26.320> for<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.950> can

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
if they make it easy for you so you can

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.280 
if they make it easy for you so you can
see<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.030> quarter<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> inch<00:02:28.570> mark<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.110> that's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
see the quarter of inch mark so that's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.530 
see the quarter of inch mark so that's
there's<00:02:29.530> four<00:02:29.769> quarters<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.910> inch<00:02:31.060> pretend

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
there's four quarters in an inch pretend

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.979 
there's four quarters in an inch pretend
it's<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.750> dollar<00:02:31.930> bill<00:02:32.170> there's<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.920> 1/4<00:02:33.459> 2/4<00:02:34.269> 3/4

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
it's a dollar bill there's a 1/4 2/4 3/4

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.470 
it's a dollar bill there's a 1/4 2/4 3/4
for<00:02:35.500> quarters<00:02:36.010> equals<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.459> dollar<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.300> that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
for quarters equals a dollar so that's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.690 
for quarters equals a dollar so that's
your<00:02:37.750> first<00:02:37.959> lesson<00:02:38.500> let's<00:02:39.310> divide<00:02:39.550> in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
your first lesson let's divide in

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.910 
your first lesson let's divide in
quarters<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:41.049> we're<00:02:41.500> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.680> divide<00:02:41.860> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
quarters then we're going to divide it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.660 
quarters then we're going to divide it
into<00:02:42.160> eighths<00:02:42.579> of<00:02:42.880> an<00:02:43.030> inch<00:02:43.120> 1/8<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.430> 1/8<00:02:45.430> is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
into eighths of an inch 1/8 and 1/8 is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.789 
into eighths of an inch 1/8 and 1/8 is
what<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.329> quarter<00:02:46.690> divided<00:02:47.110> by<00:02:47.200> two<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.560> 1/8

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
what a quarter divided by two is 1/8

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.039 
what a quarter divided by two is 1/8
maybe<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:48.910> didn't<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:49.690> that's

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
maybe you didn't know that but that's

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.430 
maybe you didn't know that but that's
what<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.620> now<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.459> have<00:02:51.820> eight<00:02:52.350> 1/8<00:02:53.350> of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
what it is so now we have eight 1/8 of

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.069 
what it is so now we have eight 1/8 of
an<00:02:53.560> inch<00:02:53.620> increments<00:02:54.130> 1/8<00:02:54.670> two<00:02:55.570> eighths<00:02:55.780> which

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
an inch increments 1/8 two eighths which

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.009 
an inch increments 1/8 two eighths which
is<00:02:56.200> 1/4<00:02:56.680> 3/8<00:02:57.660> 4/8<00:02:58.660> which<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.170> 1/2<00:02:59.910> 5/8<00:03:01.019> 6/8

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
is 1/4 3/8 4/8 which is 1/2 5/8 6/8

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.630 
is 1/4 3/8 4/8 which is 1/2 5/8 6/8
which<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.380> 3/4<00:03:03.299> 7/8<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.540> one<00:03:05.079> inch<00:03:05.260> again<00:03:05.640> so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
which is 3/4 7/8 and one inch again so

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.210 
which is 3/4 7/8 and one inch again so
let's<00:03:06.910> backtrack<00:03:07.329> there's<00:03:08.170> four<00:03:08.560> quarters

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
let's backtrack there's four quarters

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.979 
let's backtrack there's four quarters
and<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.519> dollar<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:10.060> four<00:03:10.299> quarters<00:03:10.630> an<00:03:10.750> inch

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and a dollar right four quarters an inch

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.340 
and a dollar right four quarters an inch
one<00:03:11.200> two<00:03:11.829> three<00:03:12.640> there's<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.239> fourth<00:03:13.480> how

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
one two three there's the fourth how

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.660 
one two three there's the fourth how
many<00:03:14.560> eighths<00:03:14.829> would<00:03:15.100> they<00:03:15.190> bring<00:03:15.430> an<00:03:15.519> inch

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
many eighths would they bring an inch

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.099 
many eighths would they bring an inch
well<00:03:15.940> there'd<00:03:16.150> be<00:03:16.299> 8/8<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:18.269> three<00:03:19.269> four

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
well there'd be 8/8 one two three four

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.720 
well there'd be 8/8 one two three four
five<00:03:21.010> six<00:03:22.049> seven<00:03:23.049> eight<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.280> there's<00:03:24.459> eight

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
five six seven eight so there's eight

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.690 
five six seven eight so there's eight
eighths<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.560> next<00:03:26.560> line<00:03:27.160> they've<00:03:27.430> got<00:03:27.579> on

through<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.200> whole<00:04:35.320> thing<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.770> get<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.100> if

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
through the whole thing you get it if

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.100 
through the whole thing you get it if
you<00:04:36.400> count<00:04:36.639> all<00:04:36.789> these<00:04:37.000> lines<00:04:37.270> now<00:04:37.600> all<00:04:37.810> of

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
you count all these lines now all of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.610 
you count all these lines now all of
them<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:39.460> inch<00:04:39.639> they'll<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:39.970> 64<00:04:40.750> lines

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
them to the one inch they'll be 64 lines

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.879 
them to the one inch they'll be 64 lines
here<00:04:41.979> so<00:04:42.300> that's<00:04:43.300> if<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.930> basics<00:04:44.380> just<00:04:44.620> start

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
here so that's if the basics just start

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.500 
here so that's if the basics just start
with<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.639> learn<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.180> do<00:04:46.389> your

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
with you can learn to just do your

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.029 
with you can learn to just do your
quarters<00:04:46.960> first<00:04:47.460> 1/4<00:04:49.169> 2/4<00:04:50.169> which<00:04:50.289> is<00:04:50.350> 1/2<00:04:50.530> an

quarters first 1/4 2/4 which is 1/2 an

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.670

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.240 
inch 50 cents right three quarters 75
cents<00:04:54.300> one<00:04:55.300> inch<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.800> then<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.919> can<00:04:57.039> divide

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
cents one inch and then you can divide

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.590 
cents one inch and then you can divide
quarters<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.180> get<00:04:58.300> your<00:04:58.419> eight

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
quarters and then you get your eight

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.779 
quarters and then you get your eight
it's<00:04:58.810> one<00:04:59.080> eight<00:04:59.229> two<00:04:59.470> eight<00:04:59.950> three<00:05:00.729> eight

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
it's one eight two eight three eight

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.480 
it's one eight two eight three eight
four<00:05:01.180> eight<00:05:01.240> five<00:05:01.780> six<00:05:02.260> seven<00:05:02.830> eight<00:05:02.979> eight

four eight five six seven eight eight
eighths<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.120> an<00:05:04.300> inch

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
eighths and an inch

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.980 
eighths and an inch
you'll<00:05:05.200> always<00:05:05.410> add<00:05:05.740> up<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:07.360> only<00:05:07.630> difference

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
you'll always add up the only difference

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.600 
you'll always add up the only difference
between<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.410> side<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.770> scale<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.430> this

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
between this side of the scale and this

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.920 
between this side of the scale and this
side<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:09.970> scale<00:05:10.150> on<00:05:10.270> top<00:05:10.479> is<00:05:10.780> they've

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
side of the scale on top is they've

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.900 
side of the scale on top is they've
eliminated<00:05:11.250> 64th<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.610> little<00:05:12.729> easier

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
eliminated 64th so it's a little easier

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.370 
eliminated 64th so it's a little easier
to<00:05:13.180> read<00:05:13.389> depending<00:05:13.780> on<00:05:13.870> where<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.080> what

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
to read depending on where you what

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.080 
to read depending on where you what
you're<00:05:14.500> working<00:05:14.770> on<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.550> side<00:05:15.789> all

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you're working on so this side all

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.060 
you're working on so this side all
they've<00:05:16.270> done<00:05:16.300> really<00:05:16.960> is<00:05:17.260> eliminated<00:05:17.889> all

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
they've done really is eliminated all

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.670 
they've done really is eliminated all
these<00:05:18.460> small<00:05:18.760> lines<00:05:19.000> there<00:05:19.270> are<00:05:19.300> an<00:05:19.570> e<00:05:19.660> 64<00:05:20.410> in

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
these small lines there are an e 64 in

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.409 
these small lines there are an e 64 in
between<00:05:21.130> them<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.789> this<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.060> little<00:05:22.330> easier

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
between them so this is a little easier

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.180 
between them so this is a little easier
to<00:05:22.750> read<00:05:22.900> but<00:05:23.289> as<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.590> see<00:05:23.770> that's<00:05:23.919> still

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
to read but as you can see that's still

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.219 
to read but as you can see that's still
very<00:05:25.000> easy<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.389> find<00:05:25.539> a<00:05:25.660> half<00:05:25.780> inch<00:05:26.020> mark

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
very easy to find a half inch mark

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.930 
very easy to find a half inch mark
because<00:05:26.650> that's<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.979> longest<00:05:27.310> line<00:05:27.520> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
because that's the longest line the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.839 
because that's the longest line the
quarters<00:05:28.389> are<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.720> second<00:05:29.050> longest<00:05:29.380> line<00:05:29.530> and

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
quarters are the second longest line and

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.339 
quarters are the second longest line and
the<00:05:30.849> eighth<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.330> third<00:05:31.510> longest<00:05:31.750> line<00:05:32.110> and

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
the eighth the third longest line and

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.230 
the eighth the third longest line and
thirty<00:05:32.979> seconds<00:05:33.430> or<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.580> fourth<00:05:33.880> law<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.090> the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
thirty seconds or the fourth law to the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.730 
thirty seconds or the fourth law to the
longest<00:05:34.599> line<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:34.990> they<00:05:35.139> make<00:05:35.289> it<00:05:35.320> easy<00:05:35.560> for

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
longest line so they make it easy for

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.710 
longest line so they make it easy for
you<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.889> read<00:05:36.039> it<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.250> way<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:37.150> one<00:05:37.360> thing<00:05:37.599> I

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
you to read it that way the one thing I

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
you to read it that way the one thing I
do<00:05:37.780> want<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.169> say<00:05:38.349> if<00:05:38.470> you're<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.620> little

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
do want to say if you're a little

just remember to get your if you're
learning<00:06:14.599> to<00:06:14.809> start<00:06:15.079> off<00:06:15.229> find<00:06:15.529> your
