but what's really kind of amazing about
it<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.649> we<00:01:11.100> were<00:01:11.189> able<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> take<00:01:11.850> jacket

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
it is that we were able to take jacket

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.510 
it is that we were able to take jacket
open<00:01:12.899> it<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> second<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.130> ER<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
open it up for a second here and ER and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410 
open it up for a second here and ER and
now<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.689> were<00:01:15.780> able<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> bond<00:01:17.010> that<00:01:17.490> seemed<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
now we were able to bond that seemed the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
now we were able to bond that seemed the
panels<00:01:19.380> together<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.490> stretch<00:01:20.820> bonded

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
panels together in a stretch bonded

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.100 
panels together in a stretch bonded
fabric<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.520> taping<00:01:24.030> fabric<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
fabric that actually taping fabric that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440 
fabric that actually taping fabric that
actually<00:01:25.560> allows<00:01:26.010> for<00:01:26.460> stretch<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> mobility

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
actually allows for stretch and mobility

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
actually allows for stretch and mobility
that<00:01:27.810> had<00:01:27.930> never<00:01:28.049> been<00:01:28.260> done<00:01:28.320> prior<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:29.100> this

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that had never been done prior to this

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.320 
that had never been done prior to this
jacket<00:01:29.670> being<00:01:29.880> made

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
jacket being made

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.200 
jacket being made
so<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.200> Nava<00:01:31.670> also<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.060> was

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so this Nava also with what was
