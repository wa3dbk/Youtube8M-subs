00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello i am simon from ebay de 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.039
 it's about an ace in this video 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.440
 which I personally very good 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.600
 During the diet company premium pro 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.370
 protein from west berlin's near me 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 very much like there would be the users and 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.410
 so that can take a good look what 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 what it is it is more components 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.940
 Proteins mainly consist of rain 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 and but him casein on with a view 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.149
 the ingredients will be revealed soon 49 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.859
 percent is way concentrate included 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.899
 40% casein that is already 90 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.210
 percent of this product is a pure one 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.730
 both wayne and him as well as karin 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 then of course contain strong goethes 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 6 percent cocoa powder I have here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 the milk chocolate taste allowed 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 of course, real cocoa powder in strong 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 form not missing 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 manufacturing midblock mr mail all 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.929
 interesting so this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 thickeners ultimately caused 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.710
 for having a creamy one here 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.500
 mother or with advertised extra creamy 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 a creamy consistency gets very 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
 Discourse will definitely and through 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 Of course very good very tight 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 tomorrow product me a thick one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 merckx in any case that 's just one 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 has some saturation effect is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.270
 during the diet, incidentally, for me 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 always very important since the third ms 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.490
 Fraction highways powder so ergonomics 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 the next to whey protein and quasi in the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 So it's a third protein fraction 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.869
 pure components of protein powder which 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.829
 mostly in moscow then out of casein 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.289
 And last but not least there is sweet 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.700
 Morning powder and sweetener included 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.469
 ask for your bike what the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 sweeteners, it's mine now 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.869
 view after no sweeteners the special 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.530
 not high quality are very expensive 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.600
 are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 These are sweeteners in any case 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.750
 Do not suspect cancer too 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 excite and I have to be honest 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.829
 say in combination 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.960
 schwendi very ca that is called and shake 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.760
 of it comes from the sweet very well 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.140
 Sugar tastes almost like sugar 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.770
 taste very good from there 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.700
 variation what these substances on the quasi 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.620
 paper 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.240
 I do not think so now 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.860
 all the highest quality firsts 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.840
 sweeteners but the result counts 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.380
 million of me far the taste 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.130
 and he is good 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.630
 yes what is included the vitamin mix 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.610
 here are very many in the room as well as 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.960
 all vitamins included with the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.730
 Of course, it's just such a vitamin 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.450
 thing is double-edged sword for 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.550
 the 1 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.570
 It is already very well nourished 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.350
 The vitamins are taken in the basics 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.180
 superfluous 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.180
 For me it would be very much vegetables 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.950
 a lot of fruit is very much on one 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.570
 the healthy diet focuses the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.400
 these vitamins need their foundation 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.290
 not taken for someone else 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.880
 Heated less healthy one here has the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.650
 Do not eat so much fruit so much 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.160
 vegetables is for that class that 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.260
 buried here in the vitamin 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.020
 proportions 75 percent of before 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.420
 Of course, daily quantity is already relative 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.110
 high dosage visibly overdosed 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.840
 but here are naturally beautiful again 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.330
 significant amount included 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.770
 ok i think quite interesting are still 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.070
 that's the nutrition table 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.600
 the proportion of protein is not nearly 77 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.400
 percent of that is natural for one 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.350
 multi-component chocolate flavor 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.580
 chocolate flavor is very good 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.380
 you know that you are less than gadget 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.410
 Ultimately , the nutrition table 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.280
 with 77 percent absolutely absolutely in 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.550
 order in my opinion 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.959
 carbohydrates 6 percent 5 percent the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.060
 Of course, fat comes predominantly 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.390
 which is caused by the cocoa powder 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.709
 Caro is natural 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.630
 fatty even if it kills strong 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.070
 Of course, the fat content is reflected 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.489
 in the nutrition table so a piece of the world 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.620
 low 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.709
 Absolutely five percent in every case 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.760
 in view of amino acids often 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.319
 on the amino acid balance as cas am 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.030
 total product 16 7 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.879
 that is a good value an absolute one 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.700
 worth good amino acid here at 100 grams 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.879
 protein 18 4 grams 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.260
 Of course, mostly from the car him 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.780
 Absolutely okay was something 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.139
 Bch and glutamine are the strong ones 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.489
 values, I think yes to the single 30th 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.859
 gram portions down so broken 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.479
 23 grams one now about two grams 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.870
 carbohydrates about one and a half grams 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.000
 fat 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.799
 my tip to you, however, is of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.479
 this product not only 30 grams too 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.669
 but drink during a diet 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.710
 while losing weight designed with it 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.479
 your between mindset just enough 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.240
 many snacks are accepted 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.030
 trying to make a meal a little 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.550
 replace meal by 50 or 60 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.110
 Gram powder takes and fits naturally 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.820
 then the appropriate amount also 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.229
 protein and then finally on the 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.820
 corresponding several reminders it is 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.110
 Of course, that's important too 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.460
 Also a saturation occurs for the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.810
 next two three hours 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.120
 are you the next meal again? 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.880
 you take it very well because the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.169
 Saturation from the quake experience 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.669
 In any case, great is important 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.400
 In any case, I have tried it 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.199
 with milk and with water there is hardly any 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.360
 a rwe-spokesman probably the difference so 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.919
 Big is like her with milk 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.720
 Tastes really wonderful 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.940
 really great night drinking chocolate so 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.250
 very very intense chocolate very 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.199
 full-bodied so sacred did not attack 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.699
 More happens really well if it really 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.669
 after good chocolate tastes 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.889
 a high cocoa percentage almost and 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.270
 Great taste in any case with 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.340
 water tastes more like older 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.479
 chocolate so water gets me that 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.550
 really did not taste good and 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.470
 I'm so fantastic the difference 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.880
 here is really very big drinks on 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.560
 every case with milk is just a lot 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.630
 tastier and then you have those too 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.740
 corresponding creamy consistency the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.330
 creamy consistency 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.770
 that's because it already very close 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.169
 and I say for the next hour 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.960
 hipp and of course a lot of base 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.469
 Construction site is what else is there 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 say 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.240
 Of course, aspartam is clearly in the clear 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.440
 laboratory tested made in germany is up 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.889
 every case good product of one 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.780
 reasonable brand of 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.550
 I can look forward to any future company 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.569
 fall on many walls want to lose weight 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.340
 replaced by simply in 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.529
 between meals and then you can 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.969
 Of course, in the long run, it's easy 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.629
 he does not have to lose weight to enjoy it 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.669
 renounce 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.020
 left to the is product maintains ago 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.849
 the video can go without ceasing 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.050
 daily bodybuilding I 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.300
 of course also other airways 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.789
 powder tested for you tested others 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.930
 products and certainly rated 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.969
 very interesting for the one or 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.449
 another who thinks about something right 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.419
 to lie 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.639
 ok, before I forget it would be great 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.169
 if you often like me facebook like teinach 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.029
 bodybuilding DE on facebook maybe 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.979
 also the link is under the video 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.539
 I can always do two 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.840
 three four times a week on new 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.279
 point out videos and new ones fall through 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.870
 communicate and so on to ask 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:39.330
 answer via facebook course on 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.550
 the very best a runway conditional 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.409
 you like to ask on facebook 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.939
 Of course, then very happy to answer 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.259
 I am also very well in it all clear 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.719
 I'll see you a lot in the next video 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.759
 be status symbol greater Simon below 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:52.289
 When it comes to buying a car then sitting 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.729
 with the Germans the money very loose 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.069
 while when it comes to your own body 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.139
 go when it comes to health 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.909
 is getting stingy because it is them 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.909
 saved and there is the German zum 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.650
 I think it's weird if you can 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:06.779
 a little pure if you always only 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.529
 saves itself and wants a lot 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:09.509
 rausholen 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:12.319
 that the bill does not work out 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.319
 well be clear to everyone
