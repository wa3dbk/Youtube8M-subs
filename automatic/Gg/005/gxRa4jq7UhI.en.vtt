00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:10.211
 Welcome to the intensive course of the Arms warrior. 

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:14.383
 In this video we will briefly explain what you have to do 

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.356
 to play with the Arms warrior at level 90. 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.619
 The warrior has anger as a resource. 

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:27.502
 Using automatic attacks will give you anger to use other powerful attacks. 

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.999
 Weapons warrior style focuses on accumulating anger 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.584
 to cause great damage at crucial moments. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.119
 Before fighting, enter Battle Attitude 

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.509
 and activated Battle Cry. 

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.906
 Done this, use Charge to run towards the goal 

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.025
 Stun him and generate anger. 

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:50.988
 Then use Tear, which inflicts bleeding damage over time. 

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:53.795
 Keep it active as long as possible 

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:57.024
 but do not restart it until it is about to expire. 

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:59.547
 The next step is colossal Machaque. 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.644
 Besides inflicting enough damage, it makes your attacks ignore 

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:06.379
 the target's armor for a few seconds. 

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:09.469
 Then use Deadly Strike whenever you can. 

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:13.768
 If you have plenty of anger, use it for Whirlwind 

00:01:13.947 --> 00:01:18.084
 but it is advisable to wait first for Colossal Machaque to be available. 

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:22.761
 If the target has little health, spend the anger in Execute. 

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.762
 There is much to learn to master the warrior 

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:31.137
 but we hope we have helped you a little to move in the right direction. 

00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:35.905
 When you have an idea, you should study carefully 

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:38.642
 the book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:41.804
 to see what we have not mentioned here. 

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:45.343
 Thank you very much and see you in Draenor!
