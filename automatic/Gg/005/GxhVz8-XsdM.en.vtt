unboxing the RAM tripod mounts so these

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.339 
unboxing the RAM tripod mounts so these
are<00:00:11.420> mounts<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.509> allow<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.170> from

are mounts that allow you to go from

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.980 
are mounts that allow you to go from
your<00:00:13.530> 1<00:00:13.740> inch<00:00:13.920> ball<00:00:14.160> onto<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:15.150> tripod<00:00:15.719> mount

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
your 1 inch ball onto a tripod mount

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
your 1 inch ball onto a tripod mount
there's<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.770> different<00:00:16.920> kinds<00:00:17.279> i've<00:00:17.400> got<00:00:17.550> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
there's two different kinds i've got and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.920 
there's two different kinds i've got and
I've<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.029> them<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.390> two<00:00:18.480> different<00:00:18.570> reasons

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I've got them for two different reasons

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
I've got them for two different reasons
and<00:00:18.990> I'll<00:00:19.140> explain<00:00:19.470> each<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.670> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and I'll explain each of them one of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
and I'll explain each of them one of
them<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> small<00:00:21.810> round<00:00:22.140> base<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:22.890> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
them is the small round base and one of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
them is the small round base and one of
them<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:26.840> standard<00:00:28.460> big<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:29.910> has

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
them is the standard big so this one has

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
them is the standard big so this one has
a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.300> bigger<00:00:31.099> surroundings<00:00:32.099> here

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a little bit bigger surroundings here

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.720 
a little bit bigger surroundings here
and<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:34.040> here<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and then this one here you can see has a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.410 
and then this one here you can see has a
small<00:00:36.620> base<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.370> much<00:00:38.640> support<00:00:39.210> around

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
small base so not much support around

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
small base so not much support around
the<00:00:39.540> edges<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.260> whereas<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the edges of this one whereas this one

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.000 
the edges of this one whereas this one
here<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:43.219> large<00:00:44.300> support<00:00:45.300> plate<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
here has a large support plate on the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.810 
here has a large support plate on the
bottom<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.379> gotten<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> mount<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
digital camera you can see that when we

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.610 
digital camera you can see that when we
screw<00:00:55.379> us<00:00:55.469> onto<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> bottom<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:57.780> support<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
screw us onto the bottom that support is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
screw us onto the bottom that support is
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.640> nice<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> keep<00:01:00.480> this

mount very very sturdy it's like why
tripods<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.769> those<00:01:04.949> large<00:01:05.280> mounting<00:01:05.820> plates

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
tripods have those large mounting plates

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
tripods have those large mounting plates
it<00:01:06.270> gives<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.840> place<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> screw<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it gives them a place to screw and in a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
it gives them a place to screw and in a
large<00:01:08.580> piece<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:10.130> large<00:01:11.130> platform<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.850> which

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
large piece of a large platform on which

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 
large piece of a large platform on which
to<00:01:12.680> spread<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> load<00:01:13.979> make<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> mount

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to spread the load make that mount

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.590 
to spread the load make that mount
really<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.840> secure<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.680> take<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
really really secure so i can take this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.550 
really really secure so i can take this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the roll bar mount then definitely I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.399 
the roll bar mount then definitely I
would<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.759> trusting<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:51.409> that's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
