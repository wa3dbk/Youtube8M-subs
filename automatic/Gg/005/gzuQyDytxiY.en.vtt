 month 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.739
 so where you will find a game too 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:39.189
 you are hiding yourself so there you press 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:40.540
 play you make wood the land i 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:45.569
 forgot to tell you too wait i 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.569
 will do that this game puts a trick the 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:53.790
 intruder so I'm asking you for minutes 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.269
 the cable to plug my psp it's not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 the small certainly marked all who is in 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:20.590
 game here it's a usb entry like that 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.879
 in basic with at the end a universal cable 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.829
 I want to say in prisons 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:29.859
 universal now so it's a cable 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:40.690
 like that who sliced ​​photo 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:43.560
 so much that he is then hooked up as 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.560
 that at the psp 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.820
 so that's the most it's the key 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.820
 to return to the huge select volumes 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:12.350
 so thatx c to jump a normal star 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.270
 of these start believe is to watch 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.660
 down 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.350
 round it is to turn right 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.070
 because and it's to turn you left 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.010
 and so turned up after 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.200
 that's to change the ranger in his 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.840
 trial percent the two rows of his 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.010
 fight also that's why 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.210
 as much the exchange of blocks varaire 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.340
 then she 's all here all right 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.250
 r key is done to put a block 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.620
 and the key is for which the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.560
 break well ben that's it that in 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.930
 West I hope it will be more 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.460
 bike ride and then I can not 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.460
