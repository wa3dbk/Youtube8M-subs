that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:02:04.710 

the<00:02:00.810> number<00:02:01.810> one<00:02:01.990> thing<00:02:02.320> about<00:02:03.420> omelets<00:02:04.420> is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
the number one thing about omelets is

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.249 
the number one thing about omelets is
you<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.140> have<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> low<00:02:06.210> low<00:02:07.210> heat<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
you have to have a low low heat so that

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.960 
you have to have a low low heat so that
it<00:02:08.380> cooks<00:02:08.619> through<00:02:08.860> does<00:02:09.070> not<00:02:09.190> burn

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it cooks through does not burn

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
it cooks through does not burn
put<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.630> healthy<00:02:10.840> amount<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.260> butter<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
put a healthy amount of butter in the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.130 
put a healthy amount of butter in the
omelet<00:02:14.680> pan<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.480> omelet<00:02:16.840> needs<00:02:17.050> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
omelet pan because the omelet needs to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.020 
omelet pan because the omelet needs to
be<00:02:17.260> very<00:02:17.560> well<00:02:17.920> coated<00:02:18.400> with<00:02:18.520> butter<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.970> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
be very well coated with butter so you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:36.280 
be very well coated with butter so you
know<00:02:19.239> what<00:02:19.420> does<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:19.720> stick

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.720 

all<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.579> sit

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
all right so that's going to kind of sit

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.339 
all right so that's going to kind of sit
there<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.000> cook<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.209> little<00:02:39.329> bit<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.319> don't

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349

heat and that will do its thing you'll

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.210 
heat and that will do its thing you'll
start<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.670> notice<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:55.739> will<00:02:55.859> firm<00:02:56.069> up

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
start to notice that it will firm up

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.550 
start to notice that it will firm up
around<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.760> edges<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.989> that's<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.409> how

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
around the edges and that's actually how

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.399 
around the edges and that's actually how
you<00:02:58.680> tell<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.670> ready<00:02:59.879> when<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:01.170> have

almost starts cooking the base of the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
almost starts cooking the base of the
omelet<00:03:52.670> firms<00:03:53.670> up<00:03:54.319> yeah<00:03:55.319> that's<00:03:56.220> how<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> tell

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
omelet firms up yeah that's how I tell

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.180 
omelet firms up yeah that's how I tell
them<00:03:56.970> it's<00:03:57.120> reading<00:03:57.420> about<00:03:58.010> 70%<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.069> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
them it's reading about 70% of the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.720 
them it's reading about 70% of the
omelet<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.819> cooked<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.900> we're<00:04:01.200> getting

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
omelet is cooked so we're getting

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.350 
omelet is cooked so we're getting
getting<00:04:02.730> they're<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.239> quite<00:04:03.450> ready<00:04:05.299> so<00:04:06.299> you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
getting they're not quite ready so you

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.000 
getting they're not quite ready so you
actually<00:04:06.510> mean<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.109> doesn't<00:04:07.349> pull<00:04:07.890> away

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
actually mean that it doesn't pull away

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.770 
actually mean that it doesn't pull away
from<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.489> sides<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.030> pan<00:04:09.239> when<00:04:09.569> you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
from the sides of the pan when you

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:27.760 
from the sides of the pan when you
rotate<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.890> pan<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:24.510> about<00:04:25.850> flipping<00:04:26.850> is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
rotate the pan just about flipping is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.680 
rotate the pan just about flipping is
difficult<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:31.139> can<00:04:31.320> go<00:04:32.090> awry<00:04:33.090> at<00:04:33.389> times

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
difficult so it it can go awry at times

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.990 
difficult so it it can go awry at times
but<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.229> try<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> just<00:04:34.650> do<00:04:34.770> your<00:04:34.860> best<00:04:35.039> you

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
but you try to just do your best you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.730 
but you try to just do your best you
want<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.240> get<00:04:36.419> make<00:04:36.810> sure<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.199> all<00:04:37.560> is

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
want to get make sure that all is

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.990 
want to get make sure that all is
completely<00:04:39.320> loosened<00:04:40.320> from<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.620> pan<00:04:41.000> before

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
completely loosened from the pan before

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.540 
completely loosened from the pan before
you<00:04:42.210> start<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:43.260> attempt<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.560> flip<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:47.220> give

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
you start to attempt to flip it to give

00:04:47.550 --> 00:05:15.060 
you start to attempt to flip it to give
you<00:04:47.700> good

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.750 

there<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.370> successful<00:05:16.970> flip<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:19.400> see<00:05:19.610> as

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
there is a successful flip and see as

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.090 
there is a successful flip and see as
you<00:05:20.120> notice<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.690> low<00:05:20.990> temperature<00:05:21.530> has

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
you notice that the low temperature has

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.000 
you notice that the low temperature has
kept<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.670> egg<00:05:23.660> from<00:05:23.960> browning<00:05:24.290> which<00:05:24.830> is

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
kept the egg from browning which is

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.840 
kept the egg from browning which is
exactly<00:05:25.430> what<00:05:25.670> we<00:05:25.960> need<00:05:26.960> now<00:05:27.830> we<00:05:27.890> solved<00:05:28.280> it<00:05:28.370> in

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
exactly what we need now we solved it in

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.620 
exactly what we need now we solved it in
salt<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.240> taste<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:31.670> cheese<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.390> starts

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
salt to taste the cheese on so it starts

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.750 
salt to taste the cheese on so it starts
melt<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.440> immediately<00:05:39.920> after<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.340> flip<00:05:40.610> you

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
melt so immediately after you flip you

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:57.100 
melt so immediately after you flip you
stir<00:05:40.970> -<00:05:55.150> we're<00:05:56.150> done<00:05:56.270> fresh<00:05:56.600> so<00:05:56.840> they<00:05:56.960> have<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
stir - we're done fresh so they have a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.160 
stir - we're done fresh so they have a
nice<00:05:57.260> crispy<00:05:57.830> nice<00:05:58.510> healthy<00:05:59.620> pepper<00:06:00.620> tomatoes
