00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 How are you guys talking to you again? 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.430
 Chile 84 and today I bring what I 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.740
 I promised in the last video that what is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.259
 the rebellious transmission dinosaur 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 to think they have to come out with what 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.320
 is the Russian team and locate this small 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.040
 switch that is at the output of what 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 which it is the basis of what the Russian base 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.899
 this switch because it fails 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 it should exist like that since playstation 4 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.300
 there is a crane in this sector but here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 it comes out as floating in the air 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.470
 good to start this trick they have to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 do it from two people since if you 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.670
 They make one by pressing what is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.860
 the player to interact will sound them 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.860
 a sound pretty much like that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.670
 that sound means that it is 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.160
 wrong what is the operation what 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.960
 you must do with a friend 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.510
 you have that staff or the two together you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 gives a range of 5 seconds of error together 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.360
 to this other switch that is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.950
 between the green flag 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.510
 you can also see a dinosaur 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.330
 and how snarling amidst the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.770
 good trees this switch with the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
 another has to be pressured the two 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.440
 together and so it will be for granted what it is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.900
 the operation so that this 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.510
 move the trees and what is the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.910
 roar when everything is fine you will sound 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.910
 a sound more or less like this 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.660
 the ideal of this is that two friends will 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.150
 help so that one positions oneself in 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.860
 that territory and the other in the other 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.960
 switch so they appreciate what it is 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.090
 the movement in the trees and what is 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 the roar of this dinosaur here are 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.290
 I leave you to appreciate it 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.620
 here once again we will see the movement and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.620
 the rojillo of this dinosaur 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.160
 it should be noted that once tightened 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.959
 switches are not going to be able to go back to 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280
 press for three to wait for another 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.830
 departure but the movement of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.030
 trees will continue to happen 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.739
 business thanks to carlitos a 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.239
 juanito and in my rentier friend 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.340
 I hope you liked it and we 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.390
 we will be watching in a next video 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.390
 goodbye kids
