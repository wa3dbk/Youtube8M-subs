00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.650
 hello good of all physical mantis people 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.490
 because the hero has those words 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.920
 tattooed on the hands on the knuckles 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.500
 sugar explosion what meaning 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.779
 has that tattoo and why does it have 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 constantly putting your hands on those 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.860
 bars because the reason why he 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 is imprisoned is precisely the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.590
 meaning of those two words 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.480
 explosion of sugar and I'll explain 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.200
 Why? 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.610
 as I told you the brain of maxis 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.220
 all the things that we have been 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.070
 investigating leads us to think that it is 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.410
 inside leroy eave and he loves the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.870
 candies as we already know how to read today 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.180
 when you give him the candies he is capable 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.080
 to do what you want to change the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 place box change them perks make 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.430
 everything assemble the tables everything there is in 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.710
 the tables all those special objects 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.710
 of the map helps you to do the interest 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.550
 but only and only the one of maxis takes 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.340
 he treats the zombies with love 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.000
 because he does all that when you give him 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.610
 sugar 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 why 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 It is also related to your tattoo 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 sugar explosion 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.890
 he is obsessed with sugar but 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 why then because his obsession 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 the obsession not to read today but of maxis 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.930
 it led him to commit his big mistake and it was 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 the black magic that he made in dead mode 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.160
 those experiments that he was 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 doing in that place and through 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.730
 which the demon at the end 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.090
 ended with maxis got away with that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 but because sugar explosion because 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.180

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.290
