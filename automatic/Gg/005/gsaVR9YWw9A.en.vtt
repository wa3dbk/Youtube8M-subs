 the farewell was not easy because in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 my heart I feel that I love you you are the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.320
 the only one I trust in so many anguishes 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 Today I decide to forget you and that is the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 struggle to do it from the repentant heart 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.430
 it's so easy to trust someone who 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.470
 cause pain that words are tuteamos 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 turn into spite do not believe in anyone 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.600
 just because one failed you when trying to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 again they fail again they are two mi 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.980
 heart is match of love I do not want 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 know no matter what they say is beautiful 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.080
 for me failure that was they tell you that you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.050
 love takes you to the same occasions 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.780
 they let you fall without caution or anything like that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 but with you if love so different 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.979
 that I gave you was without being a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960
 unconscious they despise you feelings 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.370

 fall in love do not get carried away by 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 chocolate or the flowers because when 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 It is very difficult to get up and you get 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 forget that living more important is that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 I die 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.859

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.719
