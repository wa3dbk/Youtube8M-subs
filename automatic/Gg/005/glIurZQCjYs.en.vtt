change over human timescales my first
reaction<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.360> wow<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:20.200> really<00:01:20.380> me<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
reaction is wow this is really me and it

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.809 
reaction is wow this is really me and it
was<00:01:22.509> just<00:01:22.720> really<00:01:22.929> fun<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.409> see<00:01:23.649> all<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.979> the

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
was just really fun to see all of the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.730 
was just really fun to see all of the
dynamics<00:01:25.450> that's<00:01:25.630> going<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.080> because<00:01:26.319> when

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
dynamics that's going on because when

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.309 
dynamics that's going on because when
you<00:01:26.830> just<00:01:26.860> see<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.190> single<00:01:27.429> picture<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:29.140> can

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
you just see a single picture you can

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.109 
you just see a single picture you can
kind<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.619> make<00:01:29.799> up<00:01:29.950> all<00:01:30.100> sorts<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.490> stories<00:01:30.759> but

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
kind of make up all sorts of stories but

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.669 
kind of make up all sorts of stories but
all<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.479> sudden<00:01:31.810> when<00:01:31.959> you<00:01:31.990> see<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.289> movie

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
all of a sudden when you see a movie

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.370 
all of a sudden when you see a movie
stitched<00:01:32.979> together<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:34.299> completely<00:01:34.959> changes

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
stitched together it completely changes

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.880 
stitched together it completely changes
everything

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
everything

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.999 
everything
you<00:01:36.700> really<00:01:37.000> see<00:01:37.149> what's<00:01:37.360> happening<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.799> you

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
you really see what's happening if you

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.529 
you really see what's happening if you
see<00:01:39.220> just<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.580> single<00:01:39.729> picture<00:01:39.909> from<00:01:40.390> Hubble

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
see just a single picture from Hubble

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.449 
see just a single picture from Hubble
you<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.170> interpret<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.709> in<00:01:41.860> many<00:01:42.340> different

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
you can interpret it in many different

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.999 
you can interpret it in many different
ways<00:01:42.819> but<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.899> fact<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.410> Hubble<00:01:44.890> has<00:01:44.979> been

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
ways but the fact that Hubble has been

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.190 
ways but the fact that Hubble has been
around<00:01:45.399> for<00:01:45.610> as<00:01:45.670> long<00:01:45.729> as<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.119> has<00:01:46.330> been<00:01:46.629> means

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
around for as long as it has been means

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.020 
around for as long as it has been means
by<00:01:47.410> taking<00:01:47.830> multiple<00:01:48.009> images<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.849> can

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
by taking multiple images you can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.639 
by taking multiple images you can
actually<00:01:49.270> stitch<00:01:49.509> them<00:01:49.959> together<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.470> watch

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
actually stitch them together and watch

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.790 
actually stitch them together and watch
how<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.700> material<00:01:51.879> moves<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:53.319> so<00:01:53.560> that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
how the material moves and so that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.350 
how the material moves and so that
really<00:01:54.069> gives<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.489> the<00:01:54.759> only<00:01:54.970> way<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.149> give

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
really gives you the only way to give

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.380 
really gives you the only way to give
true<00:01:55.629> insight<00:01:56.019> into<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.590> physics<00:01:57.269> of<00:01:58.269> the

irregular structure of the jet is caused

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.750 
irregular structure of the jet is caused
by<00:02:22.840> material<00:02:23.069> periodically<00:02:24.069> falling<00:02:24.519> onto

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
by material periodically falling onto

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.110 
by material periodically falling onto
the<00:02:24.909> star

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the star

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.959 
the star
we're<00:02:28.120> trying<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.450> study<00:02:28.659> how<00:02:28.900> stars<00:02:29.260> form<00:02:29.349> and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
we're trying to study how stars form and

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.170 
we're trying to study how stars form and
that's<00:02:30.969> a<00:02:31.209> complex<00:02:31.659> process<00:02:32.079> because<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:33.180> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
that's a complex process because if it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420 
that's a complex process because if it's
it<00:02:34.810> has<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.049> lot<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.409> feedback<00:02:35.859> in<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.219> sense

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
it has a lot of feedback in the sense

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.339 
it has a lot of feedback in the sense
that<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.730> stars<00:02:37.030> affect<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.629> clouds<00:02:37.930> and

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
that the stars affect the clouds and

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.069 
that the stars affect the clouds and
then<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.590> clouds<00:02:38.709> form<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.459> Stars<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> just

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
then the clouds form the Stars and just

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.280 
then the clouds form the Stars and just
by<00:02:41.819> looking<00:02:42.819> at<00:02:42.939> any<00:02:43.090> particular<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:43.810> process

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
by looking at any particular one process

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.259 
by looking at any particular one process
you<00:02:44.439> don't<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> full<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.819> full<00:02:45.849> picture

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
you don't get the full the full picture

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.899 
you don't get the full the full picture
and<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.019> idea<00:02:47.349> is<00:02:47.650> what<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.459> want<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> try

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
and so the idea is what we want to try

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.780 
and so the idea is what we want to try
to<00:02:48.939> do<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.720> see<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.890> main<00:02:51.129> ways<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.459> which

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
to do is to see the main ways in which

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.190 
to do is to see the main ways in which
the<00:02:51.970> Stars<00:02:52.239> can<00:02:52.540> affect<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.019> surrounding

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
the Stars can affect the surrounding

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.490 
the Stars can affect the surrounding

how our Sun formed and that's how
