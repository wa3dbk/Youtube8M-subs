00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
powerful as long as you have only these

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
powerful as long as you have only these
two<00:01:12.299> equipped<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.320> four<00:01:13.619> slots<00:01:14.060> you'll

make<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.600> glitch<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.170> easier<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:18.380> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
make this glitch a lot easier and it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
make this glitch a lot easier and it
doesn't<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.009> make<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.520> damage<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> next

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
doesn't just make the damage in the next

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.499 
doesn't just make the damage in the next
weapon<00:01:21.680> go<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> infinity

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
weapon go up like with the infinity

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.270

pistol<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.320> increases<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> fire

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pistol but it also increases the fire

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
pistol but it also increases the fire
rate<00:01:27.200> now<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rate now a might as well get to this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
rate now a might as well get to this
glitch<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.720> you'll<00:01:30.869> need<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> do

and there he's now defeated but because
you<00:03:31.290> defeat<00:03:31.590> him<00:03:31.620> doesn't<00:03:32.130> mean<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.370> you'll

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
you defeat him doesn't mean that you'll

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.750 
you defeat him doesn't mean that you'll
easily<00:03:32.850> take<00:03:33.360> out<00:03:33.570> everything<00:03:33.870> else

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
easily take out everything else

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.060 
easily take out everything else
the<00:03:35.760> shield<00:03:36.030> makes<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.540> these<00:03:37.320> minions<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.920> lot

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the shield makes it these minions a lot

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.090 
the shield makes it these minions a lot
more<00:03:38.250> formidable<00:03:38.940> than<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.710> high<00:03:40.710> Paris

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
more formidable than the high Paris

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.240 
more formidable than the high Paris
himself<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.870> once<00:03:43.290> you've<00:03:43.560> got<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.860> damage

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
himself but once you've got the damage

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.600 
himself but once you've got the damage
it<00:03:44.460> doesn't<00:03:44.880> take<00:03:45.030> much<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.690> take<00:03:45.870> them<00:03:46.050> out

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.580 

so<00:03:50.240> it's<00:03:50.360> easily<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.930> take<00:03:51.140> him<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.500> these

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
so it's easily to take him and these

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.560 
so it's easily to take him and these
minions<00:03:51.920> out<00:03:52.160> but<00:03:52.850> that's<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.360> fun<00:03:53.540> part
