00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello this is the second day of living 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.450
 with bazaars and good is made that 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.250
 we still do not know in what or what video 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.660
 let's do but first let's see what 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 is doing the Lord kisses 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.790
 what would be expected 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.400
 the virtual single list product of 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.650
 they cost us we did not do it 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.650
 lay down the receipts we made 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 we made this positions but this is the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.270
 ritual of going to cost the subject finish 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 to grab by making the water pee 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.330
 It is very cold I had to give drink to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.250
 monster 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.190
 but then at this moment I'm going to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 put on my pajamas and I always have to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 look for the loosest pillows more 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.210
 watery like my wife's bubbles 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.210
 hear me visit my girlfriend 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 I love the doubt 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 the idea is totally 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.090
 of the oppositions is not the ritual 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.820
 we say bet but what is the ritual 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.820
 it has cost me less spiritual 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:06.679
 yes yes it was seen or if it is in the story what 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:10.470
 barbarian mommy wants to want me to see 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.380
 their chords but that the rest the only thing 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.750
 I see it ok that's fine if 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.900
 it tells us it is expected 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.900
 Y 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.250
 and it is already felt nothing to know now of 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.320
 what side do you feel 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:36.460
 you always send me to where you 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.460
 You want me to be on the other side of the ham 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.350
 a suggestion that he wants us to do 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.780
 the messages as a couple are not going to 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.550
 start to get sex because no 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.440
 we know what's going to be important is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.930
 what can you put on as a couple 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.910
 you can agree or disagree on many 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.580
 things that 's why it 's part of life itself 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.680
 no, of course, yes, because we are 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.330
 angel with him agreed nothing or in that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.330
 you want to eat or where you go there 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:22.060
 there are also whites a joke seems
