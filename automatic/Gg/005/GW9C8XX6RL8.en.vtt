and go back to regular action the action
is<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.710> incredibly<00:02:05.399> over-the-top<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
is so incredibly over-the-top and the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
is so incredibly over-the-top and the
camera<00:02:06.719> cuts<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.229> perfectly<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.160> dragon<00:02:08.550> rush

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
camera cuts so perfectly the dragon rush

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
camera cuts so perfectly the dragon rush
is<00:02:08.879> mind-blowing<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.840> first<00:02:10.110> time<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> see

is mind-blowing the first time you see
it

it

it
the<00:02:11.430> downer<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> dragon<00:02:12.569> rush<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the downer is that the dragon rush is

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.150 
the downer is that the dragon rush is
basically<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.530> same<00:02:13.709> for<00:02:13.770> every<00:02:14.130> single

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
basically the same for every single

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.280 
basically the same for every single
character<00:02:14.580> more<00:02:15.540> variety<00:02:15.959> would<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.170> been

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
character more variety would have been

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
character more variety would have been
nice<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.800> dragon<00:02:17.160> rush<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.520> still<00:02:17.760> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
nice but the dragon rush is still a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.670 
nice but the dragon rush is still a
fantastic<00:02:18.660> addition<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.349> action

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
fantastic addition to the action

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.370 
fantastic addition to the action
regardless<00:02:20.360> successful<00:02:21.360> dragon<00:02:21.780> rushes<00:02:22.110> will

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
regardless successful dragon rushes will

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.020 
regardless successful dragon rushes will

cuts and the attacks themselves are

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
they make the action slightly more

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.059 
they make the action slightly more
technical<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:46.350> they're<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.860> sake

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069
