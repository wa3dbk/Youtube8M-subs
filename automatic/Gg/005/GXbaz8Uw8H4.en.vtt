00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.139
 the people here are we have 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.059
 Stop the train should be 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.790
 and today there is a new top 5 with 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 the top 5 multiplayer bexbach are many 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.970
 in a game 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.439
 and yes you should not actually 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.210
 So make a multiplayer server 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.590
 which are planned for it and we 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.290
 If the state really with times 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.720
 the first one is the first one we parked 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.310
 have chosen the luck is how high 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.809
 For example, I believe the child everyone 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 probably not in there anymore 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.100
 comes up then , for example, such a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.530
 hole what two blocks is high or you 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.329
 want to bargain somewhere or car 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.590
 somewhere high klitsch there is there 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.329
 just such a little features with 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.929
 a block breaks down then jumps and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.670
 then it is then it stands, so to speak 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.899
 in this blog that was mined one 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.399
 but still there he is with the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.559
 usually can not break down blocks 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.390
 and then level came up and jumping 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.730
 just comes up and easily high 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.559
 So you can thus a blogger goes up 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.239
 then it always works very simple in 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.670
 my blog abort waits until the block 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.550
 mined and shortly before springs lies 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.550
 and then you get up and have 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.369
 shown how to come next year 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.040
 similarly relatively yes is really useful 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.619
 but one is actually planned for it 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.210
 and the whole but shown on the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.430
 game blog island on the commissioner of 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.829
 me and if you have it in hand 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.140
 and thus a fence right click 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.399
 the s animation does not come but the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.189
 hunger is replenished that is called man 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.829
 can sprint and eat at the same time 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.899
 that works too or went to the survival 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.450
 games maps just like the fence 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.979
 have found or so of course 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.049
 forbidden that means we have never 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.789
 made 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.380
 I definitely should 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.180
 not even now , I think so 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.950
 even gefixed on the rubber server except 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.299
 somehow still with sky blog 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.250
 works at bever service tested 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.049
 it does not work anymore i believe it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.530
 By the way, works now too 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.210
 no more 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.780
 I am pretty sure that it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.340
 So many other servers goes 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.229
 should the times really fix and too 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.960
 say, we're just coming right at the beginning 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.940
 soon bak is about the game mode 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.320
 trouble in tarrytown is diverse 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.870
 maps the impression through something like that 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.560
 reverse later will block that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.420
 you do not you that you can 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 run and also no blog but that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.540
 are simply placed and the meters 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.730
 You can make it away by simply 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.590
 that it is either a sword or a sword 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.849
 minigun or something you have if 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
 then he always gets his little head 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.500
 So pull out so that's on 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.160
 ground and then all the ladders fall 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.110
 get down and you can easily drive through cars 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.550
 Random home block behind 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.470
 the whole ladders are on one 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.319
 down and thus you can easily 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.750
 going out does not bring you the principle 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.900
 really what except that outside 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 stand and do all and the whole will 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.400
 a team 1.8 fx wellness barrier 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.860
 blocks gives 1000 ladders 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.170
 be removed because he is in survival 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.580
 Games maps and war is according to one sees 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.080
 the parents repeatedly traffic and you 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.930
 can somehow always go through 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.880
 So yes we in 1.8 so in the year 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.170
 really converted to 1.8 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.690
 be history 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.780
 1.7 users are no longer allowed on 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 the servers and next we have 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.780
 a pretty funny valley has 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.549
 someone in the comments with us 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.739
 written and something was that 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.480
 So why did the guy get gold ? 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.230
 block in front of his bed how can you gold 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.239
 make a blog 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.250
 one can take power by writing 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.109
 you can not on the map kader were 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.730
 There are picture frames and picture frames 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.069
 You can destroy it by simply being in 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.510
 block produces exactly where the 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.180
 picture frame is and then it jumps off 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.859
 and got two golf blocks in front 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.130
 But you can get that 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.940
 not in gold orbit umkurvte forces 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.100
 is disabled 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.720
 There are two redstone blocks in the back 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.670
 is actually relatively funny you can 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.220
 then just put it that way 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.959
 not so easy and that's it 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.549
 actually the picture but generally if 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.950
 you just have easy blocks 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.470
 world wars right there we come to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.329
 Last day the us multiplayer 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.160
 play is noticed and you can 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.780
 just shoot through blocks though 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.220
 which are placed diagonally so to 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.870
 for example, if you have a square without 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.850
 This corner then you can thereby 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.160
 shoot through those very corners and the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.320
 then simply kill opponent or round 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.700
 Shoot function special girls 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.130
 really cool where the people then one 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.690
 if you 're on a big thing on a blog 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.240
 somehow try to install and then 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.560
 to go into cover and there you can 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.030
 shoot through and try you and 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.770
 Naturally 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.860
 pour or kill completely cool 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.420
 but definitely and yes and im 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.970
 gameplay what you see I have, by the way 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.669
 few kills not been banned because of him 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.930
 So would I have there no 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.460
 other players tested that we have 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.770
 just brought to show and yes im 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 what is it for today? 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.760
 There were a couple of horny bugs out there 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560
 Of course, more people but we are 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.690
 actually pretty much the best the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.680
 me as easy as you can 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.570
 you blow your own bow in the one after 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.310
 Front shoots around his own arrow 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.410
 runs can blow himself 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.730
 really critical is perhaps see 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.620
 we that another maria and I would 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.970
 say if you through the final cruise 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.340
 I will follow you again 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.930
 fallen sprits the like button off 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.200
 and I would say has until next 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.200
 times
