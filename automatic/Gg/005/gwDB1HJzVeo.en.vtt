00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
we'll get chemistry as you can see

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.350 
we'll get chemistry as you can see
literally<00:02:15.860> no<00:02:16.159> one<00:02:16.370> apart<00:02:16.640> from<00:02:16.819> Walker<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
literally no one apart from Walker and

literally no one apart from Walker and
me<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> tree<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.980> anyway<00:02:19.250> let's<00:02:19.430> start<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
me a tree so anyway let's start with the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.960 
me a tree so anyway let's start with the
right<00:02:20.090> wing<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.689> right<00:02:21.019> mid<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.760> beer

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
right wing and right mid so that is beer

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.089 
right wing and right mid so that is beer
biani<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:24.019> see<00:02:24.110> there<00:02:24.349> at<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.860> top

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
biani as you can see there at the top

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.750 
biani as you can see there at the top
right<00:02:25.459> he's<00:02:26.180> got<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> 96<00:02:27.049> pace<00:02:27.319> alongside<00:02:28.040> with

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
right he's got a 96 pace alongside with

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.270 
right he's got a 96 pace alongside with
walk<00:02:28.970> hose<00:02:29.360> obviously<00:02:30.049> got<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> 96<00:02:30.739> pace<00:02:31.010> once

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
walk hose obviously got a 96 pace once

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.210 
walk hose obviously got a 96 pace once
again<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.810> don't<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.709> we've<00:02:33.890> walk<00:02:34.040> up

again and I don't know we've walk up

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.089 
again and I don't know we've walk up

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
though the thing is is he really 96 pace

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.589 
though the thing is is he really 96 pace
has<00:02:37.280> he<00:02:37.400> really<00:02:37.610> got<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.909> kind<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.209> pace<00:02:38.390> in

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
has he really got that kind of pace in

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.930 
has he really got that kind of pace in
real<00:02:38.780> life<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.440> rapid<00:02:39.890> yeah<00:02:40.579> that<00:02:40.760> get

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
real life I know is rapid yeah that get

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.929 
real life I know is rapid yeah that get
me<00:02:41.030> wrong<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.390> 96<00:02:42.319> page<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.709> know<00:02:42.859> oricon<00:02:43.400> is

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
me wrong the 96 page you know oricon is

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.599 
me wrong the 96 page you know oricon is
a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.420> bit<00:02:44.510> faster<00:02:44.870> than<00:02:45.019> Lenin<00:02:45.620> yeah<00:02:45.859> but

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
a little bit faster than Lenin yeah but

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.050 
a little bit faster than Lenin yeah but
Lenin's<00:02:46.970> probably<00:02:47.540> what<00:02:48.129> 92<00:02:49.129> pay<00:02:49.370> some<00:02:49.730> fifa

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
Lenin's probably what 92 pay some fifa

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.970 
Lenin's probably what 92 pay some fifa
14<00:02:50.840> or<00:02:51.260> signing<00:02:51.560> off<00:02:52.389> 94<00:02:53.389> even<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:54.829> me

14 or signing off 94 even that for me

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.069 
14 or signing off 94 even that for me
alone<00:02:55.340> should<00:02:55.579> be<00:02:55.609> at<00:02:55.819> least<00:02:55.849> 95<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.900> if

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
alone should be at least 95 is if

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.430 
alone should be at least 95 is if
Walcott's<00:02:57.739> getting<00:02:58.010> 96<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.780> anyway<00:03:00.290> let's

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
Walcott's getting 96 but anyway let's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.319 
Walcott's getting 96 but anyway let's
come<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:01.040> Center<00:03:01.549> mids<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.970> i'm

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
come to the to Center mids and i'm

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.610 
come to the to Center mids and i'm
playing<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.659> right<00:03:02.870> wing<00:03:03.109> there<00:03:03.290> as<00:03:03.349> you<00:03:03.500> can

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
playing a right wing there as you can

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.559 
playing a right wing there as you can
see<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.069> me<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.519> chi<00:03:04.790> obviously<00:03:05.299> plays

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
see that is me at chi obviously plays

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.589 
see that is me at chi obviously plays
for<00:03:05.750> japan<00:03:06.139> and<00:03:06.560> arsenal<00:03:07.159> and<00:03:07.400> he's<00:03:07.459> got<00:03:07.879> 94

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
for japan and arsenal and he's got 94

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.229 
for japan and arsenal and he's got 94
pace<00:03:08.900> well<00:03:09.200> known<00:03:09.409> for<00:03:09.590> his<00:03:09.709> step<00:03:10.099> overs<00:03:10.489> you

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
pace well known for his step overs you

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.259 
pace well known for his step overs you
know<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.859> other<00:03:12.889> one<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.400> shelton

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
know and then the other one is shelton

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.629 
know and then the other one is shelton
who's<00:03:14.510> also<00:03:14.750> got<00:03:15.139> 94<00:03:15.590> base<00:03:15.799> i<00:03:15.980> think<00:03:16.069> he<00:03:16.489> was<00:03:16.579> a

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
who's also got 94 base i think he was a

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.039 
who's also got 94 base i think he was a
striker<00:03:17.090> by<00:03:17.420> moving<00:03:17.690> down<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.379> a<00:03:19.840> center<00:03:20.840> mid

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
striker by moving down to a center mid

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.020 
striker by moving down to a center mid
because<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.709> kind<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.099> automatically<00:03:22.730> locks

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
because it kind of automatically locks

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.979 
because it kind of automatically locks
on<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.269> their<00:03:23.480> positions<00:03:23.889> but<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.639> thing<00:03:25.849> is

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
on to their positions but the thing is

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.210 
on to their positions but the thing is
look<00:03:26.989> at<00:03:27.109> them<00:03:27.230> work<00:03:27.440> crates<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:27.859> a<00:03:27.949> strike<00:03:28.190> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
look at them work crates for a strike a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.330 
look at them work crates for a strike a
low<00:03:28.400> low<00:03:28.849> that<00:03:29.150> it's<00:03:29.299> just<00:03:29.480> awful<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.260> he<00:03:31.190> seems

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
low low that it's just awful so he seems

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.210 
low low that it's just awful so he seems
like<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.629> Berbatov<00:03:32.629> kind<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.049> blows<00:03:33.260> must<00:03:34.129> be

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
like a Berbatov kind of blows must be

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.420 
like a Berbatov kind of blows must be
really<00:03:34.459> lazy<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.419> you<00:03:35.989> know<00:03:36.109> but<00:03:36.769> anyway<00:03:37.160> on

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
really lazy and you know but anyway on

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.339 
really lazy and you know but anyway on
the<00:03:37.639> Left<00:03:37.970> thought<00:03:38.449> that's<00:03:38.629> my<00:03:38.780> phone<00:03:39.019> on<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
the Left thought that's my phone on the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.009 
the Left thought that's my phone on the
left<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:41.359> can't<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.870> is

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
left then I really can't see that is

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.900 
left then I really can't see that is
because<00:03:42.349> literally<00:03:42.889> cut<00:03:43.280> cropped<00:03:43.669> out<00:03:43.849> i

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
because literally cut cropped out i

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.960 
because literally cut cropped out i
think<00:03:44.209> it's<00:03:44.329> raj<00:03:44.599> ass<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.169> think<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.370> can't<00:03:46.819> see

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
think it's raj ass I think I can't see

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.680 
think it's raj ass I think I can't see
space<00:03:47.299> um<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.690> think<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.049> might<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.260> 96<00:03:48.980> or<00:03:49.690> 95

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
space um so I think it might be 96 or 95

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.629 
space um so I think it might be 96 or 95
I<00:03:50.959> think<00:03:51.139> yeah<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.349> think<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.680> 95<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.400> I'm<00:03:52.489> not

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
I think yeah I think it's 95 but I'm not

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.699 
I think yeah I think it's 95 but I'm not
too<00:03:52.819> sure<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.329> think<00:03:53.930> he's<00:03:54.019> from<00:03:54.199> the<00:03:54.319> League<00:03:54.680> of
