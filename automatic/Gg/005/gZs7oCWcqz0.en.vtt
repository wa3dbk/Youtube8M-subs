of<00:00:40.239> how<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:41.200> portray<00:00:41.770> Romeo<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.629> natalie<00:00:44.309> has

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
of how to portray Romeo but natalie has

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.729 
of how to portray Romeo but natalie has
created<00:00:45.579> a<00:00:45.790> scene<00:00:46.059> like<00:00:46.329> modern<00:00:46.840> day<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.410> I

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
created a scene like modern day and I

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.819 
created a scene like modern day and I
think<00:00:48.070> very<00:00:48.370> different<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.000> any<00:00:49.750> other<00:00:49.989> new

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829
