and today's play is called the angle and
attack<00:00:32.520> play<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> what's<00:00:33.960> cool<00:00:34.200> about<00:00:34.230> this

attack play and what's cool about this
is<00:00:34.890> mark<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.579> rally<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is mark and I are gonna rally up the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.569 
is mark and I are gonna rally up the
middle<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> court<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
middle of the court for a little bit and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.780 
middle of the court for a little bit and
at<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:40.110> point<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> attempt<00:00:41.700> an

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
at some point I'm going to attempt an

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
at some point I'm going to attempt an
angle<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.230> great<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
angle but what I think is great for a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.819 
angle but what I think is great for a
lot<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> guys<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
lot of you guys is you do not have to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.000 
lot of you guys is you do not have to
have<00:00:47.070> such<00:00:47.760> command<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.809> angles<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
have such command of your angles that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
have such command of your angles that
you<00:00:50.190> need<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.579> hitting<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> shot<00:00:51.149> really

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you need to be hitting this shot really

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
you need to be hitting this shot really
early<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> rally<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> times<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
early in the rally a lot of times it's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
early in the rally a lot of times it's
better<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.600> angle<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.170> wait<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
better for an angle to wait for the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.670 
better for an angle to wait for the
opportunity<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.850> present<00:00:57.059> itself<00:00:57.690> meaning

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
opportunity to present itself meaning

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
opportunity to present itself meaning
maybe<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.399> off<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> court<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.329> bit

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
maybe I was off the court a little bit

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.200 
maybe I was off the court a little bit
or<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:01.440> inside<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> baseline<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:03.030> bit

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
or up inside the baseline a little bit

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
or up inside the baseline a little bit
with<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> ball<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> came<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> little

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
with a with a ball that came a little

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.090 
with a with a ball that came a little
bit<00:01:05.430> slower<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.140> point<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.619> felt<00:01:07.860> more

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
bit slower and at that point I felt more

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670 
bit slower and at that point I felt more
comfortable<00:01:08.460> hitting<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.180> angle<00:01:09.540> okay<00:01:09.990> but

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
comfortable hitting my angle okay but

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.030 
comfortable hitting my angle okay but
the<00:01:10.830> main<00:01:11.040> idea<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.479> once<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.770> hit

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the main idea here is that once I've hit

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.200 
the main idea here is that once I've hit
my<00:01:14.250> angle<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> mark<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
my angle if I see that mark is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.219 
my angle if I see that mark is
relatively<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.659> court

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
relatively off the court

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
relatively off the court
I<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> attack<00:01:20.670> him<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:21.630> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I want to attack him I want to get in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.249 
I want to attack him I want to get in
and<00:01:22.170> hug<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> baseline<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.990> any

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and hug that baseline and look for any

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.249 
and hug that baseline and look for any
number<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> type<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> shots<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.150> hit<00:01:27.840> quickly

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
number of type of shots to hit quickly

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.830 
number of type of shots to hit quickly
to<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> open<00:01:29.040> court<00:01:29.360> before<00:01:30.360> he<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> chance

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to the open court before he has a chance

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
to the open court before he has a chance
to<00:01:31.259> recover<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.310> those<00:01:32.700> shorter<00:01:33.240> shots<00:01:33.450> might

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to recover and those shorter shots might

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.660 
to recover and those shorter shots might
present<00:01:34.049> themselves<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.829> number<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> ways<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
present themselves any number of ways it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.030 
present themselves any number of ways it
could<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> swing<00:01:36.329> volley<00:01:36.570> could<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> an<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
could be a swing volley could be an on

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
could be a swing volley could be an on
the<00:01:38.250> rise<00:01:38.430> ball<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.360> might<00:01:39.780> run<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> take<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the rise ball I might run up and take it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.630 
the rise ball I might run up and take it
just<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> traditional<00:01:42.030> volley<00:01:43.159> with<00:01:44.159> with

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
just as a traditional volley with with

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.300 
just as a traditional volley with with
that<00:01:45.030> idea<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.899> guys<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.950> ready

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that idea you guys just kind of be ready

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550 
that idea you guys just kind of be ready
for<00:01:47.610> anything<00:01:48.030> once<00:01:48.689> you've<00:01:48.930> hit<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> decent

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
for anything once you've hit a decent

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
for anything once you've hit a decent
angle<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.250> feel<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.630> oh<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.869> hit

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
angle don't feel like you know oh I hit

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
angle don't feel like you know oh I hit
my<00:01:52.320> angle<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> Brady<00:01:53.100> said<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> next

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
check out angle and attack here we go so

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
check out angle and attack here we go so
mark<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.539> hit<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> middle<00:02:11.060> until

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
mark and I will hit up the middle until

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
mark and I will hit up the middle until
I<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> good

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I see a good

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
I see a good
opportunity<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.490> hit<00:02:15.360> angle<00:02:15.840> I'm<00:02:16.500> gonna<00:02:16.710> stay

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
opportunity to hit angle I'm gonna stay

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.130 
opportunity to hit angle I'm gonna stay
steady<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.450> him<00:02:19.010> there's<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.370> oh<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
steady with him there's one oh not a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.260 
steady with him there's one oh not a
good<00:02:22.290> enough<00:02:22.650> angle<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.520> point<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
good enough angle so at that point I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.890 
good enough angle so at that point I
might<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.080> back<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.650> groove<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.900> there's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
might get back in my groove and there's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.060 
might get back in my groove and there's
a<00:02:27.990> better<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.970> guys<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.570> I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
a better one so you guys can see I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.100 
a better one so you guys can see I
attempted<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.370> angle<00:02:35.820> earlier<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.959> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
attempted one angle earlier in that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.220 
attempted one angle earlier in that
rally<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.880> wasn't<00:02:39.060> good<00:02:39.330> enough<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.810> at

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
rally and it wasn't good enough so at

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.980 
rally and it wasn't good enough so at
that<00:02:40.410> point<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.860> reset<00:02:41.400> hit<00:02:42.390> another<00:02:42.660> shot<00:02:42.780> or

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
that point I reset hit another shot or

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.890 
that point I reset hit another shot or
two<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> middle<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.180> felt<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.510> last

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
two up the middle I felt like that last

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.800 
two up the middle I felt like that last
angle<00:02:46.260> got<00:02:46.890> marked<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> position<00:02:47.880> more<00:02:48.540> off

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
angle got marked to a position more off

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680 
angle got marked to a position more off
the<00:02:49.200> court<00:02:49.850> where<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.030> point<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.480> felt

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the court where at that point I felt

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.050 
the court where at that point I felt
more<00:02:51.930> comfortable<00:02:52.170> stepping<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.880> can

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
more comfortable stepping in and you can

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
more comfortable stepping in and you can
see<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:54.300> was<00:02:54.510> inside<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.959> baseline<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.860> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
see I was inside the baseline on that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.360 
see I was inside the baseline on that
specific<00:02:57.420> play<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.350> was<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.980> short

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
specific play it was kind of a short

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.930 
specific play it was kind of a short
hopped<00:02:59.700> forehand<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:01.010> play<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> see

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
hopped forehand I play it to what I see

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
hopped forehand I play it to what I see
is<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.270> open<00:03:03.630> court<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.489> great<00:03:05.760> way

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
is the open court and it's a great way

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.220 
is the open court and it's a great way
for<00:03:06.180> me<00:03:06.570> mentally<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:08.670> play<00:03:09.120> off<00:03:09.390> my<00:03:09.720> angles

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
for me mentally to play off my angles

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.610 
for me mentally to play off my angles
and<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:12.630> Marco<00:03:13.110> running<00:03:13.470> off<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and not just see Marco running off the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.250 
and not just see Marco running off the
court<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.130> he's<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> good<00:03:14.550> mover<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.260> happens

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
court if he's a good mover and happens

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199 
court if he's a good mover and happens
to<00:03:16.350> retrieve<00:03:16.980> well<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.519> comes<00:03:17.760> back<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
to retrieve well and comes back to the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.810 
to retrieve well and comes back to the
middle<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.530> haven't<00:03:19.709> backed<00:03:20.070> up<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.370> angle

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
middle if I haven't backed up that angle

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030 
middle if I haven't backed up that angle
with<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> with<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> play<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.260> attacks<00:03:22.680> him<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
with a with a play that attacks him a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.000 
with a with a play that attacks him a
little<00:03:23.280> more<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.810> kind<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.500> feel<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
little more I I kind of feel like the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.490 
little more I I kind of feel like the
angle<00:03:26.459> goes<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.940> waste<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.390> little<00:03:27.510> bit<00:03:27.780> okay<00:03:28.440> so

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
angle goes to waste a little bit okay so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.240 
angle goes to waste a little bit okay so
go<00:03:28.860> out<00:03:29.070> there<00:03:29.750> again<00:03:30.750> whether<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.110> are<00:03:31.320> good

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
go out there again whether you are good

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.180 
go out there again whether you are good
at<00:03:32.400> pre-planning<00:03:33.269> your<00:03:33.390> angles<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.110> need<00:03:34.980> to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
at pre-planning your angles or need to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.310 
at pre-planning your angles or need to
just<00:03:35.400> wait<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.390> you've<00:03:36.600> hit<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> good

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
just wait to see that you've hit a good

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.690 
just wait to see that you've hit a good
angle<00:03:37.940> follow<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.330> shot<00:03:39.720> up<00:03:40.019> nowadays<00:03:40.700> with
