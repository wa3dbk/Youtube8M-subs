 with that constitution image here in 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.910
 the city buenos aires we go better to 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.190
 chile al dakar that you look like iquique 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.720
 Live Juan Carlos Fernandez East 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.849
 vision team 7 that is following 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.059
 step by step to the competition juan how 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.059
 these 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 how are you roberto agustina and the greeting 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 to mariano also following the dakar of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.630
 close and nicky that desert and ocean 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.789
 pacifico and we are with laia sainz the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 female representative on motorcycles how 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.199
 You have already been the good one and the day very very 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 very happy because I have arrived in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.000
 first positions was a very stage 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 very fast but also with some 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.020
 dangers that had to be watched a lot and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 the last piece of navigation that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 I have also felt comfortable 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.629
 The only thing is that it spoiled me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 command of the roadbook and had to turn it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 with the hand but good the important thing is 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 that the bike is already here well is already 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 and some complicity for what is the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.399
 desert area that cost them much more 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 the fact of the height stone 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.910
 they passed through Bolivia the height of chile 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 I also think that they felt a lot 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.409
 more comfortable with the desert that was the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.530
 last stage 422 kilometers because yes yes 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.080
 this one is for long but 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.690
 and difficult but clear after what 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.220
 we have been doing it has appeared easy 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.890
 because we suffer a lot in argentina 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 also the temperature and then in 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.440
 bolivia the altitude since we carry a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.360
 very very hard and good week has been a 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.550
 slightly softer has cost the adaptation 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.299
 just of touches that reflected the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.340
 height and reach the dunes plain not the 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 truth is that is when when 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.479
 you come from something very difficult when it's a 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.610
 little bit softer as you adapt easy 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.860
 I like sailing in the sand 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.479
 Or is it happy to be here 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 I had asked you at the beginning of 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.080
 this dakar that means as a woman the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.759
 dakar in a world practically of 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.409
 man where where most are 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.000
 male representative like how this 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.490
 sense the adaptation is the fourth year 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.750
 you come to Argentina we had already 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.330
 talked about that you enjoyed a lot of the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.179
 country also if I feel good besides me 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.850
 I 've always competed with guys 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.890
 which for me is totally normal 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.689
 and well the dakar I like it very much 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.119
 I adapt easy and I learned a lot 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.159
 well to navigate and good 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.420
 year by year improving what is important 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.860
 is that we are friends for television 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.810
 public for the whole country for the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 Argentina I say how you have tried 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.580
 people particularly highlighted how 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.510
 was the Argentinean in terms of affection the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.950
 acceptance by the dakar and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.709
 fundamentally with the woman is the case 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.799
 yours yes argentina people turn 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.280
 crazy when we passed many people in 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.769
 bolivia too and that always makes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.900
 feel better when you're going through 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.790
 a hard day you can see see public that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.319
 is there under the sun all day to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.730
 see you can encourage many 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.769
 congratulations I think it's very good in 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.090
 the general classification yes the truth is 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.370
 that I am finding myself very well 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.980
 but the important thing is how it ends 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720
 the truth is that if nothing happens and I go 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.400
 doing so I think I can do 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 a good final result but you have to 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.030
 finish it successfully follow many thanks 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.069

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.780
 the close ending in this case already to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.790
 peaceful ocean in the locality 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.590
 where you have to travel more than 700 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.270
 kilometers from santiago from the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.709
 Chilean capital to meet with 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.240
 this paradise I am going to tell my 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.310
 cameraman to show us the pacific 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.900

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.069
 peaceful ocean to full a place 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.260
 paradisiacal very cute and kike a 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.959
 small but flirtatious and 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.450
 Picturesque of northern Chile 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.170
 said near the Argentina with a cross 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.760
 important since jumps but quite 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.250
 far from what is the capital of 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.720
 santiago de chile- from here we are 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.880
 informing with everything that has to do 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.400
 with the dakar putting the color and the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.150
 heat of the people also in the north 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.470
 Chilean 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.510
 juanca one thing also always 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.910
 impressive of that place that is at 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.230
 height as it said of jumps or jujuy is 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.000
 in Chile gives the feeling that one 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.040
 see all the territory from the mountain 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.470
 Even the sea does not have the feeling 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.819
 whenever he's in Chile he sees everything 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.209
 the country even though of course not 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.209
 so be it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.860
 there we lost we lost the return lost 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.440
 the return juan is impressive is 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.420
 true the landscape at this stage 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.730
 -mariano very hard also from the dakar 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.010
 how many stages does it stay for this 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.510
 realization this is the ninth stage already 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.910
 is in Chilean territory and what 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.190
 We saw there behind what we saw 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.340
 behind Juan was what you said in 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.380
 the titles of robert that descent of that 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.930
 pending three kilometers that ends 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.940
 inside the bivouac where the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.000
 camp and also the important thing of 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.550
 this stage that are in the desert the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.820
 pilots and it is very important the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.790
 navigation in this manga because the one 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.800
 not read the route system 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.920
 follow the system of the letter to the letter 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.680
 gps can end up happening from the night to 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.630
 the weather there in the desert is what 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.300
 that the competitor was just saying no 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.280
 he has already learned well to navigate and good 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.770
 that's why he is able to get around well 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.150
 different stages is very important and 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.660
 we clarified that the competitor 6 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.660
 find ninth in the general table 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.420
 with her motorcycle with her ktm there we saw her 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.300
 just talk to Juan and while we see 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.550
 there the mini cooper the best of the 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.250
 Argentines is order and Newfoundland well 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.290
 we hope you can meet the same 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.200
 performance that has been doing until the 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.950
 moment that is fourth in the 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.730
 general table and we said ripped in 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:44.600
 rosario 421 vehicles today in competition 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.960
 there are already abandoned 202 so it is a 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.360
 very tough competition the organizers 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.580
 they tried to make the journey more 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.070
 difficult to relate it as it was done 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.950
 in africa let's not remember that here in 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.080
 South America is made of 2009 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.030
 This would be the sixth time that the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400
 long rallies from the republic 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.800
 argentina awesome images like 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.590
 they are always given from our country of 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.600
 bolivia and also chile where is 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.100
 happening in which we are going to immediately 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.690
 try to get back in touch with the 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.690
 vision team 7 from iquique
