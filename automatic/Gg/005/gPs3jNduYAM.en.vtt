when<00:02:44.650> he<00:02:44.739> was<00:02:44.860> batting<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:46.180> while<00:02:46.390> feeling

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
when he was batting in while feeling

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.059 
when he was batting in while feeling
it's<00:02:47.049> not<00:02:47.200> bad<00:02:47.440> at<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:49.470> his

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.369 

his<00:02:53.609> foot<00:02:53.909> has<00:02:54.060> certainly<00:02:54.780> saved<00:02:55.019> couple<00:02:55.290> of

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
his foot has certainly saved couple of

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.740 
his foot has certainly saved couple of
runs<00:02:55.560> here<00:02:55.920> kick<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.909> ball<00:02:57.060> back<00:02:57.420> into<00:02:57.659> play

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.710 

touch-and-go<00:03:02.940> very<00:03:03.940> difficult<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.540> tell<00:03:04.690> I

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
touch-and-go very difficult to tell I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.690 
touch-and-go very difficult to tell I
think<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.110> skirting<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.800> not<00:03:06.310> really

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
think the skirting is not really

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.960 
think the skirting is not really
destabilized<00:03:07.570> as<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.050> ball<00:03:08.230> was<00:03:08.970> pulled

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
destabilized as that ball was pulled

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
destabilized as that ball was pulled

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
back in and by Gotham Gambier I think

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.320 
back in and by Gotham Gambier I think
he's<00:03:14.560> made<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:15.090> clear<00:03:16.090> contact<00:03:16.570> there<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.850> God

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
he's made a clear contact there but God

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.640 
he's made a clear contact there but God
will<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.630> another<00:03:19.990> look<00:03:20.230> at<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.440> whether

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
will have another look at it whether

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.460 
will have another look at it whether

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.989 
that's why I played in the air for a
while<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.529> looked<00:05:01.560> as<00:05:02.009> though<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.219> could<00:05:02.879> have

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
while it looked as though it could have

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.550 
while it looked as though it could have
gone<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.180> hand<00:05:03.509> but<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.930> placement<00:05:04.409> was

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
gone to hand but the placement was

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.529 
gone to hand but the placement was
perfect

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
perfect

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.820 
perfect
welcome<00:05:06.539> boundary<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.259> will<00:05:07.499> need<00:05:07.590> some

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
welcome boundary so that will need some

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.290 
welcome boundary so that will need some
pressure<00:05:08.039> that's<00:05:08.580> what<00:05:08.789> they<00:05:08.879> need<00:05:09.029> every

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
pressure that's what they need every

pressure that's what they need every
over<00:05:10.099> yeah<00:05:11.099> wonder<00:05:11.400> if<00:05:11.490> he<00:05:11.580> timed<00:05:11.819> it<00:05:11.939> to

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
over yeah wonder if he timed it to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.050 
over yeah wonder if he timed it to
perfection<00:05:12.509> I'm<00:05:12.839> not<00:05:13.050> sure<00:05:13.430> but<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:14.610> shot<00:05:14.909> is

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
perfection I'm not sure but this shot is

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.730 
perfection I'm not sure but this shot is
on<00:05:15.180> because<00:05:15.569> there's<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.839> middle<00:05:16.199> it's<00:05:16.439> not<00:05:16.529> a

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
on because there's a middle it's not a

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.200 
on because there's a middle it's not a
long<00:05:17.039> off<00:05:17.219> and<00:05:17.430> there's<00:05:18.150> always<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.749> eerie

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
long off and there's always that eerie

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.050 
long off and there's always that eerie
so<00:05:21.210> delivery<00:05:21.719> nicely<00:05:22.379> worked<00:05:22.589> away<00:05:23.060> this

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
so delivery nicely worked away this
