00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 it's with the samsung galaxy ace 6 helps 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 and the iphone 6 plus and I will you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.599
 present the speed of the two readers 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.719
 fingerprint that we have on 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.920
 the home screen so simpson change 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.140
 his 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.090
 his reader down here who is really 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.800
 I would like a lot faster 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.550
 than before is much healthier 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 then the process for registering and 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.480
 to find out it's really 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.489
 substantially our hands now that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 the iphone 6 so all I have to do 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.820
 it's putting my finger like that and that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.580
 opens so now this is a 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.949
 thing with the success of the game louvre I 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.730
 pose on my finger and his suffering I 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.900
 no need to slide the coliseum like 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.300
 that was the case before it will be a lot 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.930
 easier in which he the more 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.019
 quick 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.600
 doc t we will do some tests and the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:03.760
 see you threaten easily so a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 time and I let my thumb open 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 there the phone 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.600
 so how to see the iphone 6 more in 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 to have seems to have more 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.990
 and it's them 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 all this is several dozens of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.159
 earth what am I doing and it's on the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.969
 all the time 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.189
 it will happen as soon as the site goes gonna 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.630
 to be a little bit better where in fact he is going 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.890
 happen times where one of the two goes 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
 become much further than the other 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.740
 present themselves with misery to recognize 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.619
 the impression but it is these postulants 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.200
 is really the hostage blade generally 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.270
 and the iphone side is what this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.490
 is not like that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.659
 so now another way that I 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.590
 can try it this is where it's both 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.500
 and bold are open 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 so in theory the system is a bit 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.390
 more perello to be launched so I like 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.530
 to be the fingers like that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 obsolete it's closed 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.420
 it's happening 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.420
 and that's 1 2 3 go 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.500
 jean-karl in this side there this way 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 there I still have an advantage of du du sisp 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 us 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.599
 how do you see him so thoroughly 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.890
 clearly and faster 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.360
 that being said the difference is we 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.720
 is not as bad as it was 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.640
 really the message for those who love 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.910
 have samsung phones 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.769
 the high-end phones from samsung 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.780
 adopted the old barn of unsold 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.310
 dante not really usable know to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 it's easier to 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.590
 enter a code but with the new him 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 of x6 forgiveness and l6 edge 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.040
 went something that is going to be 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.989
 who will be samples to convince 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 people finally to use this 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.230
 function there what was not really 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.180
 the case before 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.590
 for more information I was 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.030
 completely website and if johnson 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.030
 points like equity edge closed
