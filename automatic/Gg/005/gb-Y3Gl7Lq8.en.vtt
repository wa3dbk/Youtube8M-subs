00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
the Ute and that makes it sort of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.240 
the Ute and that makes it sort of
interesting<00:00:07.080> if<00:00:07.200> you're<00:00:07.290> into<00:00:07.529> cars<00:00:07.649> it's

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
interesting if you're into cars it's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.650 
interesting if you're into cars it's
just<00:00:08.490> slightly<00:00:08.670> more<00:00:08.910> sophisticated<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
just slightly more sophisticated and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.030 
just slightly more sophisticated and
slightly<00:00:09.900> more<00:00:09.990> complicated<00:00:10.230> want<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.889> too

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
slightly more complicated want to be too

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.169 
slightly more complicated want to be too
sophisticated<00:00:11.250> otherwise<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.969> wouldn't<00:00:12.120> be

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
sophisticated otherwise it wouldn't be

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.370 
sophisticated otherwise it wouldn't be
Top<00:00:12.420> Gear<00:00:12.630> anymore<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.080> would<00:00:13.170> turn<00:00:13.349> into

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
Top Gear anymore it would turn into

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.169 
Top Gear anymore it would turn into

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
unlikely but but yeah it's it's it won't

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.790 
unlikely but but yeah it's it's it won't
seem<00:00:21.119> unfamiliar<00:00:21.600> it'll<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> newer<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
