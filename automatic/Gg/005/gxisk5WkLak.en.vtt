00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.849
 Today was at the epicenter bought 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 materials to hang the horizontal bar 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.860
 I have an apartment corridor 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 we have a bathroom on the right 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.109
 on the left is a wall that separates the kitchen from 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.970
 bedrooms 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.970
 we have it somewhere so thick 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:36.920
 10 s ninety three centimeters distance 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 between the walls and the meter pipe means 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 our pipe will be mounted on 2 flanges 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 who put on the same pipe here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.160
 we have an expansion element 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.230
 which is screwed and fixes the pipe 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 conventional furniture stainless steel 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:12.110
 mount means this is our mount 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 it's worth saying the flange is 460 25 dia. 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 two pieces then dowels 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 I chose to base it here 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.090
 It was six because here is the distance h 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.240
 under the six and length 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.439
 you at least 60 centimeters is the length 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.439
 dowel 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.439
 gray 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.350
 and pipe pipe I have a meter thickness 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:48.200
 the walls here are zero eight millimeters 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 a diameter of 25 such a brilliant color 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.530
 I think will not get out soon 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.229
 this is done as follows 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:04.560
 the wall well, so downwards there are three 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.080
 holes then comes first 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 shesterochka to accurately be more accurate 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.140
 could get there then expand already 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.830
 under the eight rather under the top ten here 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.860
 we have 10 dowels that will still be 10 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.680
 3 such anniversary is already expanding 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.590
 one side will be enough to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.220
 keep the weight there up to 100 kilograms and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.310
 we think already well 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.560
 crossbeams will not stand well 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.870
 puncher level that's all in 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.709
 the horizon was and in fact already from being cut 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.660
 hacksaw 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:54.510
 this is a tube start over attach 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.450
 the first part then put on the second and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.049
 measure the distance I will cut 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.049
 already in fact 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.669
 and 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.450
 joystick offset
