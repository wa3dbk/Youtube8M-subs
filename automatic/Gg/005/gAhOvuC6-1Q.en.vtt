 marasciulo extraction 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.660
 and the part below obviously 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.820
 then primary said 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
 my be careful on the sides 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.109
 now 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.259
 we have to 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.310
 if not even a netlog or simply we do it another one that voted 180 degrees 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.109
 the cube 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.309
 note that the two models f24 ticket one hour photo 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.890
 this is our new passat 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.999
 now 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
 I have to proceed in this world and it's a drug drops 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.710
 in this new facade 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.630
 to make a cross 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.210
 the move and I told her to see the cube this way. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 4 and add a new born 5 then 1 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.290
 4 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.880
 we recommend this way 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 4 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.630
 right 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.550
 left 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 we aim at the cube 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 with those who have a cube 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 the informed consent for the first formed the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.560
 let's change color 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.480
 yemen state with orange 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.880
 let's try 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 with red then we vote red topshop how to transform an attim 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.120
 the cutting 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 we vote 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.990
 and we do the same 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.900
 4 such 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.210
 right 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 5 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 left we bring the cube 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 we carry the cube 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 the flea that has formed 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 let's change color 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.860
 green we try with green we vote 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.110
 green cannot be done because there is not a central cube that is true 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.110
 so let's continue with the blue 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.869
 if the approach there oven first. I said change color repeat the show 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.289
 that spike hair then still kate 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.889
 1 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.799

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.969
 left 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.489
 we aim at the cube 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.489
 sup. it's a nightmare 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 someone tells you something changes with someone 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.489
 we still have to color 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.489
 we repeat the same move 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.049
 quartucciu 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.979
 right 5 Jun 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.510
 shinystat games we throw 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.509
 + 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.409
 gualtiero 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409
 here is the crown it is finally 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.249
 now 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.359
 we must proceed 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.029
 orient with the cube orientation 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.959
 central 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.509
 you tell me this is oriented because here jaja orange at the office is fine 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.799
 these are not quizzes with piss yellow on them but green facades 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 here we must become the central cubes 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.469
 then 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.899
 we must proceed 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.139
 in this world holding firm 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.980
 this side of the cube 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.939
 we have to orientate we said 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.590
 these among cubes because this that we went on we grow still because I go to 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:32.880
 Friday green tea 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.959
 the yellow 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.579
 don't let these cubes 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.579
 prowalking up to position 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.179
 in the fazzas 3 their colors 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.319
 tradewinds 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.009
 this is orange 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.179
 you have to go here 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.759
 because al also this is blue rottanova here and it's okay for you to make it blue 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.769
 this from red 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.269
 andrea qui arrivabene because the red facade 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.089
 here we must return 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.869
 the third ring so as to position intervention 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:03.760
 Basic 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.039
 facade calculation 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.249
 to watch 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.909
 if the other cubes 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.249
 wheel t coincide exactly 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.459
 mad cole you 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.449
 we said that papabile because they vote these three rank rank 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.449
 that move to do this 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.809
 this however to make this orientation and the cm 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.470
 but now I have to read 1 2 3 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.539
 4 then 2 up 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.729
 1 left 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.849
 + 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.099
 left 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.919
 durex on 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.840
 left 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.280
 1 sisi is another time 2 Jun 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.809
 and saw that the cubes 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.029
 central these surrender we held firm because I was already in place 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.159
 but looking at the other fonts 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.590
 there are news 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.200
 and all our work I've done has remained intact with mint hair 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.969
 now that we have oriented to central cubes does not remain 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.479
 that move to the last stage 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.730
 for the resolution of the cube that is to orient 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.319
 the cubes the tiara 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.110
 to do this 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.689
 we have to 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.930
 find a cube 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.129
 that I voted with his colors 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.129
 exactly the two neighboring faces coincide 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.439
 we should find a cube that has yellow 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.770
 that does here 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.960
 nikuman colors from the ground years of career and color of neighboring faces 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.749
 this orange case 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.319
 it's blue 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.319
 then let's see 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.099
 there is not 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.349
 not even one 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.759
 mancu no 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.490
 it's a back 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.979
 marin and federica 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.520
 and we must proceed 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.919
 continue towards I said 1 2 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.150
 4 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.360
 then proceed in someone's face 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.169
 2 immediately 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.270
 right 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.469
 4 shoot 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.979
 1 left 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.199
 2 yahoo 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.379
 1 right 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.339
 4 juke 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.659
 Let's check 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.659
 core success 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.210
 here is not good 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.869
 babe here it is 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:33.869
 tell me what I told you before 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.460
 beyond this travel cube is yellow 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.830
 that goes here 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.740
 you have red and green 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.779
 the two colors of the nearby facades 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.139
 and it's perfect 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.249
 we will have to proceed 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:51.999
 still moves that I have just shown you coming this cube to the 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.430
 our right 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.759
 because the other 3 must occupy 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.050
 because net that this between ocher yellow 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.789
 green in orange 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:03.939
 valverde the orange are here 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:08.070
 so this cubature go here I automatically autoquote the other two 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.160
 they will move from here to here 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.339
 here or here 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:14.360
 equines still make amos of the penis competition factor 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.960
 I take the good one 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.990
 on our right the cubes will automatically be positioned 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.369
 I'll show him 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.349
 we repeat again 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:25.149
 left 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:26.779

 positioned
