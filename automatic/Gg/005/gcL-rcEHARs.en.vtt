backwards<00:00:06.830> loop<00:00:06.979> increases<00:00:07.700> so<00:00:08.330> nothing<00:00:08.719> up

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
backwards loop increases so nothing up

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.119 
backwards loop increases so nothing up
to<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:09.230> marker<00:00:13.209> moving<00:00:14.209> the<00:00:14.299> marker<00:00:15.129> using

to the marker moving the marker using
the<00:00:16.250> needle<00:00:16.609> to<00:00:16.730> create<00:00:17.090> a<00:00:17.119> loop<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:17.750> pinching

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
the needle to create a loop and pinching

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.480 
the needle to create a loop and pinching
it<00:00:18.350> against<00:00:18.740> your<00:00:18.890> finger<00:00:21.400> putting<00:00:22.400> the

it against your finger putting the
needle<00:00:22.789> through<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.020> pulling<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:24.530> loop<00:00:24.850> I'll

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
needle through and pulling the loop I'll

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.109 
needle through and pulling the loop I'll
do<00:00:26.030> that<00:00:26.150> one<00:00:26.270> again<00:00:26.570> just<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:27.110> make<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.530> clear

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
do that one again just to make it clear

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.840 
do that one again just to make it clear

increases<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.670> before<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.149> market<00:00:53.570> now

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
increases so just before the market now

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.680 
increases so just before the market now
the<00:00:53.750> last<00:00:54.079> increase<00:00:54.500> was<00:00:54.829> formed<00:00:55.480> that<00:00:56.480> way

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
the last increase was formed that way

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.069

I<00:00:57.230> want<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.590> backwards<00:00:58.070> one<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.149> I'm<00:00:59.239> twisting

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
I want to backwards one so I'm twisting

increases<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:17.409> because<00:01:18.409> rather

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
increases you just because rather

here<00:01:21.369> when<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:22.460> knit<00:01:22.640> them<00:01:22.850> up<00:01:23.000> that's<00:01:23.270> just<00:01:23.510> a

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
here when you knit them up that's just a

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.940 
here when you knit them up that's just a
new<00:01:23.840> stitch<00:01:24.110> being<00:01:24.380> encouraged<00:01:24.799> it

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
new stitch being encouraged it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.320 
new stitch being encouraged it
introduced<00:01:27.640> knitting<00:01:28.640> up<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.909> backwards

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
introduced knitting up the backwards

introduced knitting up the backwards
loop<00:01:29.510> increase<00:01:30.340> quite<00:01:31.340> straightforward

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
loop increase quite straightforward

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.450

messing<00:01:33.170> up<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:36.080> weave<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.500> increases<00:01:37.189> and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
messing up to weave that increases and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.820 
messing up to weave that increases and
this<00:01:37.610> time<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.659> marker<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.560> know<00:01:39.680> that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
this time I have a marker so I know that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.130 
this time I have a marker so I know that
the<00:01:40.070> increase<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.880> first<00:01:41.180> loop<00:01:41.450> after<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
the increase is the first loop after the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.249 
the increase is the first loop after the
marker

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
these my backwards loop and crease just

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.940 
these my backwards loop and crease just
missing<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> stitch<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.649> make

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
missing as if it was a stitch I do make

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.539

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
the nest that could slope increased edge

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.910 
the nest that could slope increased edge
because<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.289> reverse<00:01:58.710> slope<00:02:00.770> instead<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the size of such passing away from me so

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.930 
the size of such passing away from me so

that's on the far side of the needle
some<00:02:12.599> people<00:02:12.959> call<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> back<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.950> the

some people call it the back of the
stitch<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:15.769> big<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:20.489> again<00:02:20.819> just<00:02:21.390> making<00:02:21.780> sure

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
stitch a big and again just making sure

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.630 
stitch a big and again just making sure
that<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.470> one<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> next<00:02:23.010> couple<00:02:23.459> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that that one in the next couple of

that that one in the next couple of
stitches<00:02:23.849> are<00:02:24.209> fairly<00:02:24.450> firm<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.250> I'll<00:02:26.370> show

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
stitches are fairly firm and I'll show

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.780 
stitches are fairly firm and I'll show
you<00:02:26.670> how<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.540> lock<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.769> that's<00:02:32.010> my<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.310> rows

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you how they lock so that's my two rows

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.930 
you how they lock so that's my two rows
of<00:02:32.819> increases<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.739> down<00:02:34.950> here<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
of increases down here and down here and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.789 
of increases down here and down here and
you<00:02:36.299> can<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.959> introducing<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.650> new

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
you can see it's just introducing a new

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.100 
you can see it's just introducing a new
state<00:02:38.099> statutes<00:02:38.760> feeling<00:02:39.150> invisible<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.900> see

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
state statutes feeling invisible and see
