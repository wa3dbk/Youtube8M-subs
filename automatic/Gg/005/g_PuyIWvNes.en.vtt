 delicious and very very easy to make 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.110

 do those statesmen are delicious and 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.600
 well I think you're going to love it is a 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 variation to the typical good toast of 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 ceviche or the salad that we know 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.240
 already of tuna can be in fact with 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.210
 tuna if you do not want to buy saw can 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.189
 buying tuna very well drains tuna and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 we would have you good is costal and 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.310
 It is very easy but as if it were the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.790
 very simple fish we take 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.950
 of fish or whole fish puts you 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.070
 a little bit of water and salt covers it and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.990
 short it is steam based very easy to 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.909
 good to crumble and we're going to put 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.840
 cool so here we already have our 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.320
 fish our saw that is good 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.939
 delicious there is a fish of 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.010
 deep flavor of a pretty rich flavor 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.200
 so let's put cilantro 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.870
 Serrano chiles and you want to leave the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 Seed forward will give you very good 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.240
 nothing else what you are going to do is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.370
 Put a little cold water on it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.250
 and with this the vaquita the frozen and not 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.280
 can already are too cooked that he heard 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.980
 which have a not very pleasant flavor 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.180
 but the frescoes are wonderful we go 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.530
 to add grated carrot carrot and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.740
 our dressing does not want to put sauce 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.860
 English can also put sauce 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.780
