of burner hang anyway I should be a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
of burner hang anyway I should be a
two-hit<00:01:22.080> care<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.770> does<00:01:22.920> low<00:01:23.250> staff<00:01:23.610> Aerith

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850

all<00:01:33.810> those<00:01:33.960> sort<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.200> moves<00:01:34.380> okay<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.130> he's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
all those sort of moves okay so he's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.280 
all those sort of moves okay so he's
going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> swap<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.509> expecting<00:01:37.110> my

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
going to swap that out expecting my

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
going to swap that out expecting my
ground<00:01:37.860> moves<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> inter<00:01:38.490> dragon<00:01:38.820> ID<00:01:38.939> so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
ground moves to inter dragon ID so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
ground moves to inter dragon ID so
that's<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.930> been<00:01:40.079> affected<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that's really not been affected now and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.590 
that's really not been affected now and
I<00:01:41.579> thought<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> might<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.450> for

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I thought well I might as well go for

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
I thought well I might as well go for
the<00:01:42.659> stone<00:01:42.990> edge<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:43.549> that's<00:01:44.549> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the stone edge here because that's going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
the stone edge here because that's going
to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.570> nice<00:01:46.140> against<00:01:46.409> dragon<00:01:46.770> art<00:01:46.890> he<00:01:47.579> sets<00:01:47.759> up

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to be nice against dragon art he sets up

but even with multiscale it's going to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.300 
but even with multiscale it's going to
take<00:01:55.110> lots<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> damage<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.649> I'm<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.159> I
