00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
little less than saying at 57 as far as

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710 
little less than saying at 57 as far as
all<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.920> control<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.939> there's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.510> few<00:00:24.660> things

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
all the control but there's a few things

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
all the control but there's a few things
you<00:00:24.990> gain<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> new<00:00:25.740> piece<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.949> gear<00:00:26.160> as

you gain from this new piece of gear as
well<00:00:26.820> correct

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
well correct

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
well correct
definitely<00:00:27.990> definitely<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.920> look

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
definitely definitely well first look

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820 
definitely definitely well first look
you<00:00:30.029> may<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.390> well<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.779> 57<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> control

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you may think well my 57 has a control

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
you may think well my 57 has a control
service<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.399> has<00:00:32.579> built-in<00:00:32.910> effects<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
service on it has built-in effects this

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330 
service on it has built-in effects this
mix<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.200> why<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
mix it doesn't so why would I get this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
mix it doesn't so why would I get this
well<00:00:35.940> although<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> lack<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
well although there's a lack of the the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
well although there's a lack of the the
control<00:00:37.770> surface<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> lower

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
control surface on it it's at a lower

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
control surface on it it's at a lower
price<00:00:39.570> point<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> extra<00:00:40.530> money<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
price point with that extra money you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
price point with that extra money you
can<00:00:41.040> buy<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> MIDI<00:00:41.460> control<00:00:41.760> service<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
can buy the MIDI control service you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
can buy the MIDI control service you
want<00:00:42.450> instead<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> what's<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:43.920> which<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
want instead of what's on there which is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.680 
want instead of what's on there which is
going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:44.910> future<00:00:45.270> proof<00:00:45.480> because

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
going to be more future proof because

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
going to be more future proof because
those<00:00:45.960> features<00:00:46.379> grow<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> run<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
those features grow when you run out of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
those features grow when you run out of
controls<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.510> external<00:00:49.020> MIDI

okay<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.979> six<00:01:08.659> stackable

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
okay and now you have six stackable

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
okay and now you have six stackable
effects<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> control<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.799> instead<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> two

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
effects to control so instead of two

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
effects to control so instead of two
stackable<00:01:12.090> effects<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.570> nice<00:01:12.810> made<00:01:13.170> an

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
stackable effects that's nice made an

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
stackable effects that's nice made an
episode<00:01:13.650> gun<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:14.070> USB<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.270> schrott

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
episode gun over USB in and on schrott

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
episode gun over USB in and on schrott
oh<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:16.619> USB<00:01:16.979> -<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> 61<00:01:18.119> as

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
oh that's not over USB - and the 61 as

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.080 
oh that's not over USB - and the 61 as
opposed<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> USB<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.189> 57<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.909> that's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
opposed to USB one in the 57 so that's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
opposed to USB one in the 57 so that's
another<00:01:21.299> plus<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> has<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> 57<00:01:22.830> when

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
another plus this has over the 57 when

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
another plus this has over the 57 when
you<00:01:23.369> run<00:01:23.520> USB<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.990> got

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you run USB to your you know you got

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.920 
you run USB to your you know you got
your<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.560> i/o<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> digital

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
your more i/o on that on that digital

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
your more i/o on that on that digital
bandwidth<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> suppose<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.650> let's<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.920> over<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
bandwidth I suppose so let's go over the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.870 
bandwidth I suppose so let's go over the
i/o<00:01:29.840> analog<00:01:30.840> i/o<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.619> we've<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.670> July

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
i/o analog i/o that we've got into July
