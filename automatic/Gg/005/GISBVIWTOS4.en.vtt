hi<00:00:00.989> I'd<00:00:01.140> like<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.439> talk<00:00:01.589> about<00:00:01.650> tuning<00:00:02.310> your

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi I'd like to talk about tuning your

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi I'd like to talk about tuning your
instrument<00:00:02.879> it's<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.210> complicated<00:00:03.720> subject<00:00:04.130> it

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
instrument it's a complicated subject it

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.440 
instrument it's a complicated subject it
requires<00:00:05.520> knowledge<00:00:06.589> strength<00:00:07.970> leverage<00:00:08.970> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
requires knowledge strength leverage and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.810 
requires knowledge strength leverage and
an<00:00:10.260> instrument<00:00:10.710> that's<00:00:10.830> set<00:00:11.010> up<00:00:11.040> properly<00:00:11.519> so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
an instrument that's set up properly so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.240 
an instrument that's set up properly so
maybe<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.870> talk<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> through<00:00:13.380> those<00:00:13.530> all

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
maybe I can talk you through those all

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180 
maybe I can talk you through those all
student<00:00:14.849> instruments<00:00:15.330> come<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:16.740> should

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
student instruments come with or should

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
student instruments come with or should
come<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.580> four<00:00:17.789> fine<00:00:18.000> tuners<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.710> those<00:00:19.710> are

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
come with four fine tuners so those are

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.880 
come with four fine tuners so those are
the<00:00:20.010> easiest<00:00:20.369> way<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:20.880> tuning<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:22.410> make

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the easiest way to start tuning you make

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
the easiest way to start tuning you make
small<00:00:23.340> motions<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.029> movements<00:00:24.930> micro

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
small motions or movements micro

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.769 
small motions or movements micro
movements<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.760> pretty<00:00:27.330> safe<00:00:27.539> you're

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
movements and you are pretty safe you're

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.820 
movements and you are pretty safe you're
probably<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> break<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> string

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
probably not going to break a string

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
probably not going to break a string
that<00:00:28.980> way<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> keep<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> from

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that way you do have to keep it from

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
that way you do have to keep it from
going<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.830> hitting<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
going all the way down and hitting the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
going all the way down and hitting the
wood<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.030> cause<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> lot<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.079> vibration

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
wood which can cause a lot of vibration

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.700 
wood which can cause a lot of vibration
and<00:00:34.860> noise<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.719> scratch<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.230> instrument

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and noise and scratch up the instrument

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
and noise and scratch up the instrument
of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> tailpiece<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.000> probably<00:00:39.690> need<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of the tailpiece you probably need to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
of the tailpiece you probably need to
get<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.230> electronic<00:00:40.860> tuner<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> early

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
get an electronic tuner in the early

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
get an electronic tuner in the early
days<00:00:41.940> something<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> needle<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> light

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
days something with a needle or a light

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
days something with a needle or a light
system<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> tells<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.059> yes<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.629> meant<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
system that tells you yes I meant on the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.979 
system that tells you yes I meant on the
accurate<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:46.800> okay<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.239> good<00:00:48.420> starting

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
accurate now okay that's a good starting

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
accurate now okay that's a good starting
point<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.440> tuning<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.399> teacher<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
point for tuning your teacher can get it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
point for tuning your teacher can get it
really<00:00:51.360> close<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.739> lesson<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really close for you in your lesson and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
really close for you in your lesson and
then<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.579> home<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> hopefully<00:00:54.120> nothing's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
then you go home and hopefully nothing's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
then you go home and hopefully nothing's
just<00:00:55.050> radically<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just radically and then you can get it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
just radically and then you can get it
back<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.260> needle<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.859> back<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
back to the needle can go back to the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
back to the needle can go back to the
top<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.670> each<00:00:59.789> string<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.930> tune<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
top on each string and you can tune it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.020 
top on each string and you can tune it
that<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.859> eventually<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.850> move

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that way but eventually you want to move

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
that way but eventually you want to move
beyond<00:01:03.449> fine<00:01:03.870> tuners<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.369> able

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
beyond fine tuners and actually be able

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830 
beyond fine tuners and actually be able
to<00:01:05.580> seem<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> professional<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
to seem like a professional from the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
to seem like a professional from the
pegs<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:08.100> tell<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> couple<00:01:08.520> things

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
pegs so I will tell you a couple things

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.550 
pegs so I will tell you a couple things
about<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
about that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.230 
about that
you<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:11.189> pegs<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.790> set<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
you want your pegs to be set up so that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.070 
you want your pegs to be set up so that
they're<00:01:15.470> vertical<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:17.570> horizontal<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:19.049> E

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
they're vertical and not horizontal my E

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
they're vertical and not horizontal my E
string<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.619> horizontal<00:01:20.250> Houston<00:01:20.820> peg<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
string is horizontal Houston peg and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
string is horizontal Houston peg and
that's<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> worst<00:01:22.049> place<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.590> most<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that's the worst place that most of the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
that's the worst place that most of the
pegs<00:01:23.189> could<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> doesn't<00:01:24.420> matter<00:01:24.720> on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
pegs could be in it doesn't matter on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.310 
pegs could be in it doesn't matter on
the<00:01:25.049> E<00:01:25.080> string<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.549> tune<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> e

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
the E string because I don't tune the e

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.390 
the E string because I don't tune the e
from<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.680> position<00:01:29.750> ever<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> fine

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
from this position ever I use the fine

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
from this position ever I use the fine
tuner<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.939> any<00:01:33.060> string<00:01:33.450> always<00:01:34.040> all

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
tuner for any string always all

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.370 
tuner for any string always all
professionals<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.509> E<00:01:36.750> string<00:01:36.990> fine<00:01:37.170> tuner

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
professionals use an E string fine tuner

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
professionals use an E string fine tuner
unless<00:01:37.680> they're<00:01:37.890> baroque<00:01:38.220> specialists<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
unless they're baroque specialists and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.219 
unless they're baroque specialists and
they're<00:01:39.030> using<00:01:39.240> gut<00:01:39.540> strings<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they're using gut strings and then you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
they're using gut strings and then you
have<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> tune<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> e<00:01:40.979> string<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
have to tune in the e string from the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
have to tune in the e string from the
peg<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.270> peg<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> be

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
peg but the way you get your peg to be

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
peg but the way you get your peg to be
set<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.439> proper<00:01:46.860> place<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
set in the proper place would be to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.069 
set in the proper place would be to
you<00:01:50.979> unwind<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.729> string<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:52.030> little<00:01:52.060> bit<00:01:52.420> then

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
you unwind the string a little bit then

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.840 
you unwind the string a little bit then
pull<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.380> string<00:01:53.409> out<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.770> little<00:01:54.100> bit<00:01:54.369> or<00:01:54.579> push

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
pull the string out a little bit or push

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.669 
pull the string out a little bit or push
it<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.119> depending<00:01:55.329> on<00:01:55.719> where<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.320> think<00:01:56.350> it

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
it in depending on where you think it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.950 
it in depending on where you think it
was<00:01:56.859> wind<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.609> back<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.090> take<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.270> look<00:01:58.479> are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
was wind it back up and take a look are

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.490 
was wind it back up and take a look are
you<00:01:59.079> there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
you there

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.260 
you there
if<00:01:59.979> your<00:02:00.189> brand-new<00:02:00.490> strings<00:02:00.819> are<00:02:01.000> going<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
if your brand-new strings are going to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.090 
if your brand-new strings are going to
stretch<00:02:01.539> some<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.109> it's<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.590> problem<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:02.920> may

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
stretch some so it's a problem you may

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.950 
stretch some so it's a problem you may
have<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.399> tune<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.299> then<00:02:04.479> come<00:02:04.659> back<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
have to tune it and then come back the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.740 
have to tune it and then come back the
next<00:02:05.170> day<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.679> process<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.450> you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
next day and do this process so you you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.570 
next day and do this process so you you
work<00:02:07.959> with<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.289> pull<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.709> out<00:02:08.860> or<00:02:09.129> push<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.310> in

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
work with it pull it out or push it in

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.789 
work with it pull it out or push it in
after<00:02:10.090> you've<00:02:10.209> loosened<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.840> until<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.500> can

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
after you've loosened it until you can

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.789 
after you've loosened it until you can
get<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.540> vertical<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.019> okay<00:02:14.470> if

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
get it vertical like that okay if

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.259 
get it vertical like that okay if
there's<00:02:15.099> an<00:02:15.220> angle<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:16.000> going<00:02:16.150> to

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
there's an angle like this it's going to

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.780 
there's an angle like this it's going to
be<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> lot<00:02:16.690> harder<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.260> tune<00:02:17.440> at<00:02:17.620> first<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.640> get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
be a lot harder to tune at first you get

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.089 
be a lot harder to tune at first you get
to<00:02:18.849> where<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.299> do<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.860> isn't

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
to where you can do it but this isn't

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.490 
to where you can do it but this isn't
very<00:02:21.340> good<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.690> horrible<00:02:23.140> actually

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
very good and this is horrible actually

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.660 
very good and this is horrible actually
you<00:02:23.590> don't<00:02:23.680> want<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.340> one's<00:02:24.519> not

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
you don't want that one this one's not

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.509 
you don't want that one this one's not
great<00:02:25.120> either<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> but<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:27.400> in

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
great either but I can do it but not in

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.130 
great either but I can do it but not in
the<00:02:27.640> early<00:02:27.730> days<00:02:28.060> okay<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.450> then<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> next

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the early days okay so then the next

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
the early days okay so then the next
thing<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.769> strings<00:02:30.130> go<00:02:30.370> into<00:02:30.819> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
thing is that your strings go into the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.319 
thing is that your strings go into the
peg<00:02:31.120> box<00:02:31.329> correctly<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> string<00:02:33.819> comes

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
peg box correctly if the string comes

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.470 
peg box correctly if the string comes
across<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.900> nut<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.319> then<00:02:36.220> does<00:02:36.579> not<00:02:36.610> follow

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
across the nut and then does not follow

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.990 
across the nut and then does not follow
a<00:02:37.660> channel<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.379> track<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.040> puts<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.579> right<00:02:39.610> up

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
a channel a track that puts it right up

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.420 
a channel a track that puts it right up
near<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.660> wood<00:02:40.900> or<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> peg<00:02:41.440> box<00:02:41.590> wall<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
near the wood or the peg box wall on the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.789 
near the wood or the peg box wall on the
side<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.150> peg<00:02:43.360> head<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> problem

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
side of the peg head you have a problem

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.309 
side of the peg head you have a problem
if<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.579> crosses<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.120> nut<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.660> goes<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
if it crosses the nut and goes the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.160 
if it crosses the nut and goes the
opposite<00:02:47.890> direction<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.670> any<00:02:48.910> way<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:50.049> are

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
opposite direction in any way you are

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.479 
opposite direction in any way you are
going<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> string<00:02:50.980> that's<00:02:51.099> pushing

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
going to have a string that's pushing

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.440 
going to have a string that's pushing
that<00:02:52.299> way<00:02:52.569> now<00:02:53.530> your<00:02:53.709> pegs<00:02:53.920> are<00:02:54.130> conical<00:02:54.639> it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
that way now your pegs are conical it

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.720 
that way now your pegs are conical it
tapered<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.590> have<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.859> push<00:02:57.069> this<00:02:57.310> way<00:02:57.519> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
tapered and you have to push this way to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.640 
tapered and you have to push this way to
get<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> sit<00:02:58.359> and<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:59.049> it's<00:02:59.230> pushing<00:02:59.500> that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
get it to sit and if it's pushing that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.629 
get it to sit and if it's pushing that
way<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.190> trying<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.850> unlock<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.639> loosen

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
way it's trying to unlock and loosen

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.300 
way it's trying to unlock and loosen
yours<00:03:03.880> your<00:03:04.420> peg<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.019> make<00:03:05.709> sure<00:03:05.739> when<00:03:06.280> you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
yours your peg so make sure when you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.759 
yours your peg so make sure when you
wind<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.849> up<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.750> ends<00:03:08.019> up<00:03:08.079> going<00:03:08.290> near<00:03:08.680> at

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
wind it up that it ends up going near at

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.280 
wind it up that it ends up going near at
the<00:03:08.889> peg<00:03:09.069> box<00:03:09.250> wall<00:03:09.519> if<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.150> too<00:03:10.480> hard<00:03:10.930> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the peg box wall if it's too hard to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.259 
the peg box wall if it's too hard to
move<00:03:11.440> look<00:03:11.799> in<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.160> see<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.430> you've<00:03:12.549> jammed<00:03:13.000> it

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
move look in and see if you've jammed it

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.000 
move look in and see if you've jammed it
up<00:03:13.389> against<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.780> peg<00:03:14.019> rock<00:03:14.200> peg<00:03:14.560> box<00:03:14.739> wall

up against the peg rock peg box wall

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.059 
up against the peg rock peg box wall
there's<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.670> risk<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.120> cracking<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.630> wood

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
there's a risk of cracking the wood

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.509 
there's a risk of cracking the wood
right<00:03:18.389> where<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.599> hole<00:03:20.169> is<00:03:20.380> drilled<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
right where the hole is drilled so you

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.610 
right where the hole is drilled so you
do<00:03:21.819> not<00:03:22.090> want<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.540> jam<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.109> there<00:03:23.319> right

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
do not want to jam it in there right

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.680 
do not want to jam it in there right
next<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.099> wood<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.489> then<00:03:24.609> keep<00:03:24.970> turning

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
next to the wood and then keep turning

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.449 
next to the wood and then keep turning
it<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:26.049> you're<00:03:26.560> putting<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:26.950> new<00:03:27.160> string

it as you're putting on a new string
it's<00:03:27.849> very<00:03:28.030> dangerous

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
it's very dangerous

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.750 
it's very dangerous
also<00:03:29.319> you<00:03:29.590> will<00:03:29.799> not<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.190> will<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.669> able

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
also you will not you will not be able

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.370 
also you will not you will not be able
to<00:03:30.910> move<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.359> peg<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.870> can<00:03:31.989> actually<00:03:32.260> hurt

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
to move the peg and it can actually hurt

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.930 
to move the peg and it can actually hurt
your<00:03:32.590> hand<00:03:32.799> hurt<00:03:32.950> your<00:03:33.160> wrist<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.459> can<00:03:33.489> strain

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
your hand hurt your wrist you can strain

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.180 
your hand hurt your wrist you can strain
your<00:03:34.209> muscles<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.349> should<00:03:35.590> be<00:03:35.739> really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
your muscles so it should be really

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.819 
your muscles so it should be really
close<00:03:36.400> or<00:03:36.700> even<00:03:36.790> maybe<00:03:37.269> just<00:03:37.419> touching<00:03:38.049> but

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
close or even maybe just touching but

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.780 
close or even maybe just touching but
not<00:03:39.069> tight<00:03:39.489> okay<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:42.099> these<00:03:42.519> two

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
not tight okay so you know these two

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.360 
not tight okay so you know these two
would<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.120> against<00:03:43.630> this<00:03:43.780> side<00:03:44.049> okay<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.010> then

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
would be against this side okay so then

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.580 
would be against this side okay so then
what<00:03:45.579> do<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.849> do<00:03:46.030> with<00:03:46.359> your<00:03:46.599> hand<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.410> tune

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
what do you do with your hand to tune

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.129 
what do you do with your hand to tune
from<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.889> pegs<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:49.389> would<00:03:49.569> tune<00:03:49.750> our<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.079> string

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
from the pegs we would tune our a string

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.699 
from the pegs we would tune our a string
first<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.859> either<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:52.299> piano<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.079> or<00:03:53.560> an

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
first to either a piano a or an

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.820 
first to either a piano a or an
electronic<00:03:54.190> pitch<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:55.799> so

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
electronic pitch a so

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.280 
electronic pitch a so
you're<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.880> pick<00:03:59.150> your<00:03:59.180> middle<00:03:59.780> finger

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
you're going to pick your middle finger

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.100 
you're going to pick your middle finger
and<00:04:00.470> your<00:04:00.830> thumb<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.270> put<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:02.390> on<00:04:02.600> your<00:04:03.080> a

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
and your thumb and put it on your a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.200 
and your thumb and put it on your a
string<00:04:03.350> peg<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.700> take<00:04:04.880> your<00:04:05.060> first

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
string peg like that and take your first

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.290 
string peg like that and take your first
finger<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.960> wrap<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.770> around<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.250> scroll<00:04:07.550> so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
finger and wrap it around the scroll so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.790 
finger and wrap it around the scroll so
there's<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.780> pulling<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:11.660> will<00:04:11.930> pull<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.560> peg

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
there's a pulling this will pull the peg

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.300 
there's a pulling this will pull the peg
into<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.150> hole<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.660> help<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.410> stick<00:04:15.650> so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
into the hole and help it to stick so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.340 
into the hole and help it to stick so
not<00:04:16.549> only<00:04:16.730> are<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.000> turning<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.780> direction

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
not only are you turning this direction

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.380 
not only are you turning this direction
but<00:04:18.860> you're<00:04:19.070> pulling<00:04:19.250> sideways<00:04:20.230> okay<00:04:22.390> that's

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
but you're pulling sideways okay that's

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.590 
but you're pulling sideways okay that's
how<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:23.570> do<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.960> string<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:24.620> get<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.600> from

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
how I do the a string I get the a from

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.080 
how I do the a string I get the a from
the<00:04:26.780> electronic<00:04:27.500> tuner<00:04:27.830> or<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.190> piano<00:04:28.580> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the electronic tuner or the piano and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.580 
the electronic tuner or the piano and
then<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.300> learned<00:04:29.570> how<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.810> listen<00:04:30.410> carefully

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
then I learned how to listen carefully

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.350 
then I learned how to listen carefully
for<00:04:30.920> Beats<00:04:31.280> or<00:04:31.460> flutter<00:04:31.730> that's<00:04:32.090> another

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
for Beats or flutter that's another

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.080 
for Beats or flutter that's another
lesson<00:04:33.290> completely<00:04:34.130> right<00:04:34.580> now<00:04:34.760> if<00:04:34.940> you're

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
lesson completely right now if you're

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.910 
lesson completely right now if you're
using<00:04:35.120> an<00:04:35.540> electronic<00:04:35.990> tuner<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.560> trying<00:04:36.800> to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
using an electronic tuner and trying to

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.710 
using an electronic tuner and trying to
learn<00:04:37.040> how<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.250> tune<00:04:37.460> from<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.700> pegs<00:04:37.970> no

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
learn how to tune from the pegs no

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.910 
learn how to tune from the pegs no
problem<00:04:39.110> we're<00:04:39.350> just<00:04:39.530> learning<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
problem we're just learning the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.490 
problem we're just learning the
mechanics<00:04:40.430> here<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:40.880> for<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.720> D<00:04:41.930> string

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
mechanics here so for the D string

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.220 
mechanics here so for the D string
I<00:04:42.700> hold<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.850> peg<00:04:44.030> between<00:04:44.420> my<00:04:44.570> index<00:04:44.930> finger

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
I hold the peg between my index finger

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.130 
I hold the peg between my index finger
our<00:04:45.350> first<00:04:45.560> finger<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:45.920> my<00:04:46.040> thumb<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.930> take

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
our first finger and my thumb and I take

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.420 
our first finger and my thumb and I take
the<00:04:48.350> middle<00:04:48.800> finger<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.190> ring<00:04:49.220> finger

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
the middle finger and the ring finger

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.650 
the middle finger and the ring finger
and<00:04:50.240> set<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.720> around<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.140> scroll<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.940> then<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
and set it around the scroll so then the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
and set it around the scroll so then the
pulling<00:04:54.050> motion<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.670> this
