00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
for this how because of how crucial it
is<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.079> grow<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.860> channel<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.250> youtube<00:01:44.640> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
is to grow your channel on youtube with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
is to grow your channel on youtube with
early<00:01:45.240> access<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> game<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.369> even<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
early access to a game and even on that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
early access to a game and even on that
it<00:01:47.759> makes<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.270> rare<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.659> it'll<00:01:48.869> be

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it makes it more rare because it'll be

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.679 
it makes it more rare because it'll be
less<00:01:49.320> content<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.850> than<00:01:51.149> previously

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
less content on there than previously

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
less content on there than previously
cuz<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.320> ps4<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.189> yeah<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
cuz it's not with ps4 so yeah that's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
cuz it's not with ps4 so yeah that's a
crucial<00:01:54.329> time<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.869> even<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.500> me<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
crucial time so even more so for me to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950 
crucial time so even more so for me to
get<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.340> content<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:57.329> early<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.840> you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.260 
series so it doesn't usually yeah I was
surprised<00:05:12.159> by<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:12.699> yeah<00:05:12.880> Liverpool

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
surprised by that but yeah Liverpool

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.520 
surprised by that but yeah Liverpool
I'll<00:05:13.389> probably<00:05:13.539> do<00:05:13.750> Liverpool<00:05:14.110> at<00:05:14.199> one<00:05:14.349> point

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
I'll probably do Liverpool at one point

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.170 
I'll probably do Liverpool at one point
so<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.800> begin<00:05:15.190> this<00:05:15.340> teams<00:05:15.729> I'm<00:05:15.909> gonna<00:05:16.030> do

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
so to begin this teams I'm gonna do

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.240 
so to begin this teams I'm gonna do
eventually<00:05:16.720> just<00:05:17.229> Manchester<00:05:17.770> United<00:05:18.130> from

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
eventually just Manchester United from

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.649 
eventually just Manchester United from
the<00:05:18.430> start<00:05:18.669> as<00:05:18.789> I<00:05:18.909> feel<00:05:19.090> there's<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.330> of<00:05:19.569> a

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
the start as I feel there's more of a

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.600 
the start as I feel there's more of a
challenge<00:05:20.080> with<00:05:20.590> Manchester<00:05:21.069> United<00:05:21.099> because

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
challenge with Manchester United because

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.189 
challenge with Manchester United because
of<00:05:21.729> how<00:05:21.849> they've<00:05:22.060> dropped<00:05:22.240> off<00:05:22.479> with<00:05:22.990> last

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
of how they've dropped off with last

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.320 
of how they've dropped off with last
season<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.740> there<00:05:24.520> may<00:05:24.610> sound<00:05:24.819> like<00:05:24.849> Luke

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
season and there may sound like Luke

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.450 
season and there may sound like Luke
Shaw<00:05:25.629> from<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.349> start<00:05:26.650> because<00:05:26.979> it'll<00:05:27.400> be

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
Shaw from the start because it'll be

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.589 
Shaw from the start because it'll be
kind<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:27.759> fitting<00:05:28.060> because<00:05:28.120> people<00:05:28.479> always

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
kind of fitting because people always

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.480 
kind of fitting because people always
like<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.930> see<00:05:29.080> high<00:05:29.379> potential<00:05:29.710> players<00:05:30.039> so<00:05:30.340> be
