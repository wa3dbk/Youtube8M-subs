the<00:04:20.440> analogy<00:04:20.680> with<00:04:21.100> horse<00:04:21.310> racing<00:04:21.730> that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the analogy with horse racing that

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.020 
the analogy with horse racing that
Hingis<00:04:22.780> has<00:04:22.990> been<00:04:23.250> running<00:04:24.250> an<00:04:24.400> allowance

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
in the class races where she's going to

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.800 
in the class races where she's going to
