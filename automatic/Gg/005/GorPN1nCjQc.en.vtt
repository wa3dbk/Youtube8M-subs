00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
to make a check style pilsner that we

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.100 
to make a check style pilsner that we
thought<00:01:25.009> could<00:01:25.250> actually<00:01:25.550> really<00:01:26.119> be<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
thought could actually really be the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.249 
thought could actually really be the
benchmark<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:29.539> craft<00:01:29.929> beer<00:01:30.200> industry

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
will check style filter and I really

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.320 
will check style filter and I really
believe<00:01:33.800> how<00:01:34.220> if<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.759> know<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.240> that's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
believe how if I know that that's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.109 
believe how if I know that that's
exactly<00:01:35.810> what<00:01:36.020> we've<00:01:36.170> done<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.850> what<00:01:37.850> we<00:01:37.970> have
