00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
did is i started to make the hard on the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800 
did is i started to make the hard on the
inside<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:17.820> take<00:00:18.119> two<00:00:18.390> oval

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
inside to do that you just take two oval

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.189 
inside to do that you just take two oval
mediums<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.029> shrink<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.570> rotate<00:00:21.990> them

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
mediums and shrink them and rotate them

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.230 
mediums and shrink them and rotate them
flip<00:00:23.070> them<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.460> whatever<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> do

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
flip them do whatever you have to do

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
flip them do whatever you have to do
until<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> heart<00:00:26.310> that's

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
until you have about the heart that's

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
until you have about the heart that's
you<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:28.789> looks<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> heart<00:00:30.240> anyway<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you know looks like a heart anyway the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.740 
you know looks like a heart anyway the
next<00:00:32.130> step<00:00:32.610> i<00:00:33.350> use<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.160> ring<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
next step i use the ring to make my

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.790 
next step i use the ring to make my
outline<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.890> i<00:00:38.520> found<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> ring<00:00:39.870> opened<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.680> up

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
outline so i found the ring opened it up

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
outline so i found the ring opened it up
hit<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:41.940> bumper<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.960> have

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
hit the right bumper so you just have

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
hit the right bumper so you just have
the<00:00:43.230> outline<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.860> made<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> size<00:00:44.700> big<00:00:45.480> enough

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the outline and made the size big enough

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.190 
the outline and made the size big enough
so<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> inner<00:00:46.559> ring<00:00:47.010> became<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.450> ring<00:00:48.989> i

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so that the inner ring became the ring i

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.330 
so that the inner ring became the ring i
was<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:51.050> after<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> i<00:00:52.559> put<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
was going to use after that i put the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.549 
was going to use after that i put the
useless<00:00:53.850> sped<00:00:54.090> snap<00:00:54.329> sped<00:00:55.110> snaps<00:00:55.469> fist<00:00:56.870> on<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
useless sped snap sped snaps fist on the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
useless sped snap sped snaps fist on the
inside<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.280> first<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.910> i<00:00:59.940> made<00:01:00.030> was

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
inside there i first one i made was

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
inside there i first one i made was
black<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> i<00:01:00.930> made<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.670> bigger

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
black and i made it a little bit bigger

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
black and i made it a little bit bigger
so<00:01:02.969> was<00:01:03.210> sticking<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.290> was

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so was sticking it just a little bit was

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.730 
so was sticking it just a little bit was
sticking<00:01:04.920> out<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> bottom<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.540> I'm

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
sticking out the bottom and then I'm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.870 
sticking out the bottom and then I'm
duplicated<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.070> made<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.250> white<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
duplicated it and made it white and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.670 
duplicated it and made it white and
shrunk<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
shrunk it down so you can see it on the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
shrunk it down so you can see it on the
black<00:01:10.920> heart<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:12.360> also<00:01:12.510> gives<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
black heart and it also gives that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.499 
black heart and it also gives that
little<00:01:12.990> outline<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> bottom<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
little outline at the bottom of the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.700 
little outline at the bottom of the
forearm<00:01:17.509> once<00:01:18.509> that's<00:01:18.689> done<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
forearm once that's done you have to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
forearm once that's done you have to
make<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.159> triangles<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.810> arrows<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> go

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
make the triangles like arrows that go

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
make the triangles like arrows that go
around<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.830> ring<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> triangle<00:01:24.960> thin<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
around the ring the triangle thin and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
around the ring the triangle thin and
the<00:01:26.310> triangle<00:01:26.820> medium<00:01:27.180> work<00:01:27.360> best<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> put<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the triangle medium work best to put the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.230 
the triangle medium work best to put the
triangle<00:01:28.439> medium<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> bottom<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
triangle medium on the bottom and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
triangle medium on the bottom and
triangle<00:01:30.689> thin<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> top<00:01:31.350> rotate<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
triangle thin at the top rotate them and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
triangle thin at the top rotate them and
shrink<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.200> sure<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.619> aren't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
shrink them and to make sure they aren't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
shrink them and to make sure they aren't
like<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.880> aren't<00:01:36.119> connecting<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> other

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
like they aren't connecting to the other

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.950 
like they aren't connecting to the other
half<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> ring<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> took<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
half of the ring you just I took the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
half of the ring you just I took the
explode<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.400> liked<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
explode just because I liked the way it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
explode just because I liked the way it
looked<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.740> put<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.220> layer

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
looked and put it in the right layer

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
looked and put it in the right layer
spot<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:45.659> underneath<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
spot so that it was underneath the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.429 
spot so that it was underneath the
triangle<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.340> above<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> ring<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.439> give

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
triangle but above the ring and give

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.310 
triangle but above the ring and give
your<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.100> gives<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.670> gap

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
your so it gives you that little gap

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.920 
your so it gives you that little gap
once<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> done<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:54.270> took<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
once I had that done I just took the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
once I had that done I just took the
drip<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> made<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.250> red<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> gave<00:01:56.909> myself<00:01:57.090> two

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
drip and made it red and gave myself two
