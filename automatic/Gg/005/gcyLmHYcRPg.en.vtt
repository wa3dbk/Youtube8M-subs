00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
situation is in control

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.090 
situation is in control
alright<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.289> think<00:01:37.380> where<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> people

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
alright I think where a lot of people

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
alright I think where a lot of people
make<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> mistake<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.570> designing<00:01:40.079> stalking

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
make a mistake when designing stalking

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.169 
make a mistake when designing stalking
rods<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.399> they<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.609> they've<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:41.939> me<00:01:42.149> a

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
rods is they think they've got me a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.319 
rods is they think they've got me a
broom<00:01:42.359> handle<00:01:42.509> okay<00:01:43.909> it's<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.030> their<00:01:45.210> head

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
broom handle okay it's in their head

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.870 
broom handle okay it's in their head
it's<00:01:45.539> it's<00:01:45.780> hook<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:46.500> hold<00:01:46.619> right<00:01:47.219> so<00:01:47.759> it's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it's it's hook and hold right so it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.279 
it's it's hook and hold right so it's
got<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.149> strong<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.990> really

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
got to be strong but that's not really

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.139 
got to be strong but that's not really
the<00:01:49.380> case<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.280> line<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.820> got<00:01:50.969> to<00:01:51.060> be

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the case it's your line that's got to be

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
the case it's your line that's got to be
strong<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> say<00:01:52.170> let<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.499> stiffer<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
strong well I say let the stiffer the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.109 
strong well I say let the stiffer the
rod<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> more<00:01:53.280> pressure<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.880> rest<00:01:53.999> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
rod the more pressure on the rest of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.399 
rod the more pressure on the rest of
your<00:01:54.210> circle<00:01:54.539> isn't<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> end<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> day

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
your circle isn't at the end of the day

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
your circle isn't at the end of the day
that<00:01:55.649> close<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> pressures

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that close up all the pressures

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
that close up all the pressures
transferred<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.929> hook<00:01:58.109> what's<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
transferred to the hook what's the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.959 
transferred to the hook what's the
stretch<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> gone<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> light<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.850> all

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
stretch is gone from the light it's all

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.239 
stretch is gone from the light it's all
just<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.170> you've<00:02:01.289> got<00:02:01.499> to<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
just right so so you've got to have the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.789 
just right so so you've got to have the
rod<00:02:02.429> that's<00:02:02.609> got<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.850> decent<00:02:03.090> buffer<00:02:03.840> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
rod that's got a decent buffer in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.730 
rod that's got a decent buffer in
between<00:02:04.859> okay<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.420> acting<00:02:06.840> yeah<00:02:07.289> it's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
between okay this is acting yeah it's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
between okay this is acting yeah it's
like<00:02:07.979> pole<00:02:08.729> elastic<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.420> you've<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
like pole elastic so you've got a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.510 
like pole elastic so you've got a
strength<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> bank<00:02:10.470> itself<00:02:10.920> yeah<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
strength in the bank itself yeah but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.030 
strength in the bank itself yeah but
obviously<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.970> bend<00:02:12.240> in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.450> risers<00:02:12.750> gonna

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
obviously that bend in the risers gonna

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.870 
obviously that bend in the risers gonna
come<00:02:14.040> third

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
come third

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.390 
come third
of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.330> rod<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.750> where<00:02:16.200> oh<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.890> all<00:02:16.980> rapid

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
of the rod is where oh it's all rapid

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520 
of the rod is where oh it's all rapid
yeah<00:02:17.700> yeah<00:02:18.000> sure<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:18.990> oh

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
yeah oh yeah that's lots of stalker rods

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.480 
yeah oh yeah that's lots of stalker rods
in<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> past<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.590> there<00:02:23.130> pokers

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
to this section of the rod that starts

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.580 
to this section of the rod that starts
to<00:02:27.510> flatten<00:02:27.720> nail<00:02:27.960> because<00:02:28.200> that's<00:02:28.320> what<00:02:28.470> sure
