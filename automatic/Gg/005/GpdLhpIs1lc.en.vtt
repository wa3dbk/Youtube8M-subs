00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
so this is a video response to Alan w2a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.650 
so this is a video response to Alan w2a
ews<00:00:05.779> video<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.280> RF<00:00:08.280> samplers<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.980> AMD<00:00:10.980> mods

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
ews video on RF samplers and AMD mods

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.240 
ews video on RF samplers and AMD mods
yeah<00:00:12.690> neat<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.049> video<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.650> he<00:00:13.799> showed<00:00:14.040> how

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
yeah neat little video or he showed how

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.810 
yeah neat little video or he showed how
to<00:00:14.280> monitor<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> ham<00:00:15.089> radio<00:00:15.269> station<00:00:16.160> using<00:00:17.160> an

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
to monitor a ham radio station using an

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.380 
to monitor a ham radio station using an
oscilloscope<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.619> took<00:00:19.740> his<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.460> his<00:00:20.670> design

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
oscilloscope so I took his on his design

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.349 
oscilloscope so I took his on his design
and<00:00:21.720> built<00:00:22.199> into<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.859> case<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:23.880> I'll

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and built into a little case here I'll

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.790 
and built into a little case here I'll
open<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.019> show<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> insides<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
open it up and show you the insides of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
open it up and show you the insides of
it<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.430> back<00:00:26.640> side<00:00:27.090> has<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.900> output<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.820> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it the back side has the output so you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
it the back side has the output so you
have<00:00:29.970> an<00:00:30.090> eye<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.539> RF<00:00:31.019> input<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.800> output<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
have an eye an RF input and output and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.150 
have an eye an RF input and output and
then<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.750> sampler<00:00:35.600> port<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.160> damad

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
then you have a a sampler port and damad

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.090 
then you have a a sampler port and damad
port<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.230> I'll<00:00:40.230> open<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> I'll<00:00:40.950> show<00:00:41.070> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
port and I'll open up and I'll show you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
port and I'll open up and I'll show you
the<00:00:41.190> schematics<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.329> I'll<00:00:42.480> demonstrate

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the schematics and then I'll demonstrate

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
the schematics and then I'll demonstrate
how<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> works<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> digital<00:00:44.879> scope<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.570> use

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
how it works on a digital scope you use

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.340 
how it works on a digital scope you use
an<00:00:45.899> analog<00:00:46.170> scope<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> analog<00:00:47.430> scope<00:00:48.350> has

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
an analog scope and the analog scope has

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
an analog scope and the analog scope has
different<00:00:49.800> performance<00:00:50.449> than<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
different performance than way the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.650 
different performance than way the
digital<00:00:52.020> scopes<00:00:52.820> pick<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> signals<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.420> so

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
digital scopes pick the signals up so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
digital scopes pick the signals up so
the<00:00:55.260> interesting<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> show<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> differences

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the interesting to show the differences

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.349 
the interesting to show the differences
between<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:57.180> digital<00:00:58.140> rhaegal<00:00:58.680> scope<00:00:58.980> here

put a higher wattage resistor there to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.770 
put a higher wattage resistor there to
make<00:02:29.090> sure<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.480> wear<00:02:29.569> my<00:02:29.630> how<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
make sure that I can wear my how to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380 
make sure that I can wear my how to
route<00:02:29.989> watt<00:02:30.230> radio<00:02:30.410> into<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.239> a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
route watt radio into it so this is a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.449 
route watt radio into it so this is a
this<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.260> 1<00:02:33.410> watt<00:02:33.560> resistor<00:02:34.010> here

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
this is a 1 watt resistor here

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.080 
this is a 1 watt resistor here
then<00:02:35.420> there's<00:02:36.260> my<00:02:37.450> register<00:02:38.450> ground<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
then there's my register ground and the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.900 
then there's my register ground and the
capital<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:43.180> points<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:44.269> 1<00:02:44.480> nano<00:02:44.690> farad<00:02:44.870> cap

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
capital the points are 1 nano farad cap

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.410 
capital the points are 1 nano farad cap
and<00:02:46.910> then<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.630> D<00:02:47.780> mod<00:02:47.959> circuit<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:50.060> top<00:02:50.269> off

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and then the D mod circuit we top off

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.530 
and then the D mod circuit we top off
the<00:02:50.660> same<00:02:50.840> point<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:51.739> through<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.670> 10<00:02:53.360> peak

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the same point here go through a 10 peak

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.350 
the same point here go through a 10 peak
affair<00:02:53.750> cap<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:56.200> diode<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.530> ground

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
affair cap we have a diode to ground

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.640 
affair cap we have a diode to ground
this<00:02:59.360> got<00:02:59.930> another<00:03:00.140> one<00:03:00.319> here<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.980> then<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.030> go

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
this got another one here and then we go

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.070 
this got another one here and then we go
with<00:03:03.650> another<00:03:04.120> thousand<00:03:05.120> watt<00:03:05.269> capped<00:03:05.569> ground

with another thousand watt capped ground

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.160 
with another thousand watt capped ground
for<00:03:06.590> filtering<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.480> enable<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.540> resistor<00:03:08.989> here

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
for filtering and enable a resistor here

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.420 
for filtering and enable a resistor here
1k<00:03:09.670> resistor<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.820> then<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.420> our<00:03:11.510> D<00:03:11.660> mod

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
1k resistor and then out to our D mod

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.289 
1k resistor and then out to our D mod
port<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.420> that's<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:15.049> right<00:03:15.109> here<00:03:15.560> so

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
port so that's this one right here so

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.920 
port so that's this one right here so
there's<00:03:17.299> our<00:03:17.859> 10<00:03:18.859> Pico<00:03:19.160> farad<00:03:19.430> cap<00:03:19.750> here's<00:03:20.750> our

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
there's our 10 Pico farad cap here's our

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.259 
there's our 10 Pico farad cap here's our
2<00:03:21.709> diodes<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.950> our<00:03:24.950> capacitor<00:03:25.519> yeah

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
2 diodes and then our capacitor yeah

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.500 
2 diodes and then our capacitor yeah
better<00:03:26.480> picture<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:26.959> here<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:28.820> capacitor

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
better picture of this here on capacitor

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.130 
better picture of this here on capacitor
and<00:03:29.750> bleeder<00:03:30.680> resistor<00:03:30.820> going<00:03:31.820> around<00:03:32.140> so

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
and bleeder resistor going around so

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.330 
and bleeder resistor going around so
that's<00:03:33.320> about<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.560> little<00:03:33.739> better<00:03:33.890> picture<00:03:34.070> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
that's about a little better picture the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.190 
that's about a little better picture the
whole<00:03:34.459> circuit

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.410 

okay<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.010> now<00:03:41.250> I've<00:03:41.400> got<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.580> hooked<00:03:41.819> up<00:03:42.060> here

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
okay so now I've got it hooked up here

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.479 
okay so now I've got it hooked up here
I've<00:03:42.750> got<00:03:42.959> my<00:03:42.990> scope<00:03:43.440> my<00:03:44.340> gall<00:03:45.530> ds-11<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:47.040> to

test<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.830> 20<00:03:59.730> meters<00:04:00.200> got<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:02.310> gnar

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
test it it's on 20 meters got the gnar

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.970 
test it it's on 20 meters got the gnar
sampler<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.750> got<00:04:03.930> my<00:04:04.050> output<00:04:04.410> for<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.709> radio

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
sampler so I got my output for the radio

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.670 
sampler so I got my output for the radio
going<00:04:05.190> into<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.489> back<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.880> our<00:04:06.030> sampler

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
going into the back of the our sampler

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.559 
going into the back of the our sampler
and<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:07.890> I've<00:04:08.040> got<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.670> when<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.330> comes

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
and then I've got that's when this comes

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.780 
and then I've got that's when this comes
out<00:04:09.720> here<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.110> dummy<00:04:10.380> load<00:04:10.530> under<00:04:11.489> what<00:04:11.610> dummy

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
out here to dummy load under what dummy

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.540 
out here to dummy load under what dummy
load<00:04:11.940> back<00:04:12.180> there<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.350> then<00:04:13.739> I've<00:04:14.010> got<00:04:14.190> my<00:04:14.370> arm

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
load back there and then I've got my arm

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.680 
load back there and then I've got my arm
sampler<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.300> on<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:16.019> green<00:04:16.820> coax<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.479> goes

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
sampler for it on the green coax it goes

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.680 
sampler for it on the green coax it goes
down<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.079> channel<00:04:19.380> 1<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.709> my<00:04:19.859> scope<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:21.450> then

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
down to channel 1 on my scope and then

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.260 
down to channel 1 on my scope and then
I've<00:04:21.780> got<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.200> red<00:04:23.190> coax<00:04:23.580> here<00:04:23.760> on<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> D<00:04:24.120> mod

just fine so you can see that that's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.880 
just fine so you can see that that's
showing<00:04:59.550> how<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.750> RF<00:05:01.020> carrier<00:05:01.200> on<00:05:01.470> a.m.<00:05:01.740> it

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
showing how the RF carrier on a.m. it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.310 
showing how the RF carrier on a.m. it
goes<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.370> then<00:05:03.300> we<00:05:03.450> have<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.900> amplitude

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
goes and then we have the amplitude

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.950 
goes and then we have the amplitude
modulation<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:05.250> switch<00:05:05.970> over<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.180> USB<00:05:06.479> mode<00:05:06.780> and

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
modulation I switch over to USB mode and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240 
modulation I switch over to USB mode and
you'll<00:05:07.080> see<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.380> carrier<00:05:07.650> goes<00:05:07.770> away<00:05:08.039> and

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
you'll see the carrier goes away and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.640 
you'll see the carrier goes away and
you'll<00:05:08.460> see<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.930> just<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.140> modulated

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
you'll see the just the modulated

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.819 
you'll see the just the modulated
signals<00:05:10.950> we'll<00:05:11.130> do<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.310> here

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:14.829 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.969 

okay<00:05:15.829> now<00:05:16.129> we're<00:05:16.279> on<00:05:16.369> USB<00:05:16.879> and<00:05:17.779> now<00:05:18.679> when<00:05:18.949> I

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
okay now we're on USB and now when I

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.719 
okay now we're on USB and now when I
transmit<00:05:19.839> then<00:05:20.839> we'll<00:05:21.199> see<00:05:21.439> more<00:05:22.159> just<00:05:22.639> the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
transmit then we'll see more just the

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.879 
transmit then we'll see more just the
modulation<00:05:23.179> there<00:05:23.539> a<00:05:23.719> little<00:05:24.559> bit<00:05:24.649> of<00:05:24.739> sine

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
modulation there a little bit of sine

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.200 
modulation there a little bit of sine
wave

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.590 

okay<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:30.960> now<00:05:31.139> I've<00:05:31.350> turned<00:05:31.650> on<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:32.600> channel

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
okay so now I've turned on the channel

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.620 
okay so now I've turned on the channel
to<00:05:34.490> output<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:36.350> now<00:05:37.350> we're<00:05:37.590> still<00:05:37.830> on<00:05:38.330> AM<00:05:39.330> mode

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
to output and now we're still on AM mode

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.650 
to output and now we're still on AM mode
here<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.169> then<00:05:40.919> when<00:05:41.039> I<00:05:41.070> keep<00:05:41.310> transmit<00:05:42.030> we'll

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
here and then when I keep transmit we'll

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.700 
here and then when I keep transmit we'll
see<00:05:42.900> on<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.080> scope

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
see on the scope

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.640 
see on the scope
there's<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:44.190> modulated<00:05:44.759> signal<00:05:45.650> signal

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
there's the modulated signal signal

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.689 
there's the modulated signal signal
there<00:05:46.800> so<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.699> can<00:05:47.789> see<00:05:47.880> my<00:05:48.000> voice<00:05:48.210> Peaks<00:05:49.699> and

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
there so you can see my voice Peaks and

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.689 
there so you can see my voice Peaks and
that's<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.690> said<00:05:52.110> Allen's<00:05:52.740> video<00:05:53.430> looks<00:05:53.639> a

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
that's I said Allen's video looks a

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.689 
that's I said Allen's video looks a
little<00:05:53.789> different<00:05:54.060> than<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.900> analog<00:05:55.229> scope

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
little different than the analog scope

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.330 
little different than the analog scope
versus<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:56.910> digital<00:05:57.240> scopes<00:05:57.509> I<00:05:58.039> can<00:05:59.039> do<00:05:59.220> the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
versus the digital scopes I can do the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.770 
versus the digital scopes I can do the
other<00:05:59.490> thing<00:05:59.699> Alan<00:06:00.360> showed<00:06:00.570> with

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
other thing Alan showed with

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.260 
other thing Alan showed with
superimposing<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.500> two<00:06:01.800> so<00:06:02.130> you<00:06:02.190> do<00:06:03.120> that

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
superimposing the two so you do that

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.610 
superimposing the two so you do that
here<00:06:03.509> we'll<00:06:03.660> turn<00:06:03.780> both<00:06:03.960> channel<00:06:04.470> 1<00:06:04.590> and

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
here we'll turn both channel 1 and

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.439 
here we'll turn both channel 1 and
channel<00:06:04.800> 2<00:06:05.039> on<00:06:07.220> so<00:06:08.220> this<00:06:08.699> is<00:06:08.849> a<00:06:08.880> little<00:06:09.150> trick

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
channel 2 on so this is a little trick

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.659 
channel 2 on so this is a little trick
that<00:06:09.710> he'll<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:10.889> an<00:06:11.099> arrow<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:11.580> I'll

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
that he'll and an arrow so I'll

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.230 
that he'll and an arrow so I'll
duplicate<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.330> where<00:06:13.080> he<00:06:13.289> puts<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:14.240> channel

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
duplicate that where he puts the channel

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.969 
duplicate that where he puts the channel
2<00:06:15.419> and<00:06:15.720> positioned<00:06:16.139> up<00:06:16.229> there<00:06:16.440> so<00:06:16.650> it's<00:06:16.830> right

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
2 and positioned up there so it's right

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.089 
2 and positioned up there so it's right
on<00:06:17.130> top<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.020> top<00:06:19.020> part<00:06:19.289> of<00:06:19.440> carrier<00:06:19.860> on<00:06:20.070> the

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
on top of the top part of carrier on the

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.950 
on top of the top part of carrier on the
AM<00:06:20.370> signal<00:06:20.789> so<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.090> see<00:06:21.270> demodulated<00:06:21.930> signal

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
AM signal so you see demodulated signal

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.890 
AM signal so you see demodulated signal
writing<00:06:22.440> on<00:06:22.530> top<00:06:22.770> of<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.539> carrier<00:06:24.539> so<00:06:24.570> you<00:06:24.780> get

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
writing on top of the carrier so you get

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.240 
writing on top of the carrier so you get
your<00:06:24.960> two<00:06:25.110> signals<00:06:25.440> simultaneously<00:06:25.590> going

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
your two signals simultaneously going

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.640 
your two signals simultaneously going
into<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.490> screen<00:06:26.759> there<00:06:26.970> so<00:06:27.560> hope<00:06:28.560> you

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
into the screen there so hope you

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.950 
into the screen there so hope you
enjoyed<00:06:28.889> watching<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.250> video<00:06:29.750> there's<00:06:30.750> a<00:06:30.810> mat

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
enjoyed watching the video there's a mat

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.520 
enjoyed watching the video there's a mat
