00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.720
 we have to make the second delivery 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.599
 of these fingering exercises in 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.089
 this time I give you 4 that have to 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.429
 see directly with force speed and 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.429
 Precise exercises that will help you 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.679
 a lot if they are starting and maybe 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.900
 You will also help yourself if you have 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.820
 some difficulties or some problems 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.820
 with your technique so let's go there 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.990
 well this first exercise is planned 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.509
 and already has the goal of starting 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.940
 make a little more precise with your fingers 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.170
 of the left hand 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.310
 normally we always play so 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.560
 linear as if we were but not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 always as if we were playing 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.240
 complex chords 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.369
 this sequence of 1 2 3 4 but separated 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.340
 by strings is a bit of a sensation 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.080
 strange and at the beginning it's going to cost you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.180
 but if I 'm going to tell you it's a 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.770
 spectacular tool to generate 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.409
 independence of movements with 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.170
 fingers and on the other hand another goal that 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.399
 has the exercise is that of the barb that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 it's descending and ascending almost almost 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.119
 giving it as a hand or as a greeting 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.119
 al sweet picking 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.340
 well this second exercise has things 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 very very interesting and one of them is 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.980
 how much can we jump ropes in this 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.720
 exercise that is an extreme what we are going 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.600
 to do is jump 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.910
 from the sixth string to the first 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.460
 rope always playing with the puja 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.240
 alternating bone down up up down 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.090
 and the other grace is that it also makes us 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.730
 locate very well with the barb comprising 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.760
 very good where in the guitar 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 we are playing his sixth first fourth 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.850
 fifth second or third wherever 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.140
 that you are taking with this exercise to 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.140
 end you will see where it is 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.969
 do not 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.640
 well this third fingering has to 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.170
 see directly with rhythmic but not 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.300
 necessarily with the rhythm that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.750
 we make the first part of the 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.500
 Exercise is a combination of barb 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.500
 interned 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.080
 and for the second round when it sounds like 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.080
 same 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.700
 what we are going to do is occupy hammer 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.310
 and now in the grace of the hammer is that 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.600
 leave only the left hand as 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.430
 matrix as a source of rhythm and no longer 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.300
 we occupy in the barb the only thing we do 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.300
 is to hit once the rope and the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.340
 following two strokes are responsible 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.550
 directly from this hand then what 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.040
 what we are trying to achieve is that 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.820
 this hand has rhythmic and above all 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.820
 force 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
 do not 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.659
 the fourth exercise is based 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.909
 directly in the same mechanics of 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.969
 exercise number 3 but now there is a 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.530
 ease and there is a grace in this that 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.560
 have to see that we are going to occupy now 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.479
 finger four and three that are the fingers 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.120
 that are a little more committed 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.219
 when we touch and feel weaker 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.710
 what we are doing is generating outside 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.889
 that skill and precision in a single 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.050
 exercise and is that this video liked you 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.060
 please I'm going to ask you to give me a 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.490
 like and if you liked it much more 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.830
 please subscribe, I'll ask you 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.150
 who share this video with the people 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.370
 that you know he's learning to play 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.650
 guitar or who wants to improve his technique 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.949
 we see another time I leave a kiss 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.949
 bye
