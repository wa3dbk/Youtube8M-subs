that this is very just basic stuff and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.580 
that this is very just basic stuff and
I'm<00:04:43.370> sure<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.820> all<00:04:43.910> changes<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> time<00:04:44.720> but

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I'm sure it all changes the time but

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.040 
I'm sure it all changes the time but
