you're finished with using it like this
here<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.880> good<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> finish<00:01:15.530> there<00:01:16.530> really

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
here it's good to finish there really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
here it's good to finish there really
because<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.110> fabric<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
because you know it's the fabric is a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.870 
because you know it's the fabric is a
little<00:01:20.960> flimsy<00:01:21.960> ER<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.500> okay<00:01:22.880> cause

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
little flimsy ER but it's okay cause

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
little flimsy ER but it's okay cause
seriously<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.479> used<00:01:24.869> lots<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.259> sleeping<00:01:25.680> bags

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
seriously I used lots of sleeping bags

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
seriously I used lots of sleeping bags
and<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:28.610> minus-35<00:01:29.840> comfort<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:32.990> it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and for a minus-35 comfort that's it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
and for a minus-35 comfort that's it's
better<00:01:34.229> than<00:01:34.409> most<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> sleeping<00:01:35.310> bags

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
better than most of the sleeping bags

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
better than most of the sleeping bags
that<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:35.820> been<00:01:35.939> using<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.869> prefer<00:01:37.259> using

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
then a baby the BT doesn't tend to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.520 
then a baby the BT doesn't tend to
breathe<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.720> much<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.689> yeah<00:01:45.689> yeah<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.470> was

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
neck collar here over here and then make

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.080 
neck collar here over here and then make
