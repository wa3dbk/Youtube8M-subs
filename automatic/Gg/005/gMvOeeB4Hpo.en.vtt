00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.500
 installation of a washing machine in this 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.049
 case 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.949
 set day washing machine what 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.039
 necessary for washing installation 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 machines are required to connect 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.720
 cold water here you can see that the hose from 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.650
 washing machine plug crane 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.650
 cold water supply 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 output output diameter just to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.140
 tap is three three-quarters of an inch 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.140
 standard thread 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.690
 special tap is usually called 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.690
 faucet for washing machines 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:06.540
 in this case it is open you can close 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:09.990
 and draining the water from the washing machine into 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:17.610
 sewer pipe case 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:22.549
 32 mm tube and special 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 check valve is worth it is clear that he 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.930
 the hose is bolted to the clamp 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.460
 the check valve flew off just in case 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 guarantees that from there from the sewer 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.290
 no washing water back 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.409
 well basically in this case you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:51.110
 impossible since height 80 somewhere 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.110
 millimeters from floor to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.970
 sewer pipes and hardly of course 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.300
 she will rise but I don't know if you have 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 first floor friend then such a thing 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.240
 you need to suddenly clog up the sewer 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:18.050
 that means cold water connection 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.590
 washing machine and drain connection from 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.970
 washing machine down the drain and third 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.640
 the moment that is needed to connect 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.110
 washing machine is electricity 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.470
 Accordingly, the socket is usually 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 use a socket with a lid if u 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.730
 you bath is worth protects from hitting 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.840
 moisture if you accidentally have something there 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.030
 splattered 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.430
 water and it can fly into the outlet 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.530
 better still with a cap use 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.709
 that's all so connects 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.709
 washing machine at the ready supply 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.379
 there
