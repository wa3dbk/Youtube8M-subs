00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 Y 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.230
 Y 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.230
 yes 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.570
 hello friends and welcome to another video 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.450
 Today I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.160
 make a glass or cup for water with 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 just using a piece of paper 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.610
 this is very useful if you 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.470
 they find in a place like 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.279
 airport or college university 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 where they do not have access to a glass but yes 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.489
 to drinkers and where you do not want 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.220
 be able to bring your mouth to the water troughs 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.590
 that normally are not very very 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.589
 hygienic but with cope connected 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.100
 of paper to be able to fill it and it's 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.610
 also a very attractive thing and I 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 It seems that it is very useful to know 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.940
 all you need is a piece of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 role as you see here and I'm going to start 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 make the different folds seemed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.790
 how it is done 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 then the first fold will consist of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.130
 move one of the ends of paper or 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 paper angles here we go to this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 right and move it all up from 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.659
 this way forming a kind of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.460
 triangle 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.469
 make sure that the paper or the fold 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.929
 match as best as possible with the part 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.229
 above do not stop here because it's done 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.229
 easier 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.590
 this is the first sheet now the 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.159
 second hit as you see here I'm going to fold 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.939
 this this remaining excess of the triangle 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.909
 which is actually a square that 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.259
 we are trying to do we are not going to 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.119
 see so we're going to flip this is the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.119
 first click like this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.200
 make sure that this fold does not pass 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.590
 of the size of the triangle of the first foot 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.579
 what we did then to recap 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.549
 we have our piece of paper the 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.870
 first fold we make a triangle 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:15.390
 second fold 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.720
 we bend here in this way 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 as you can see when I speak like that is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.420
 we make a perfect triangle 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.190
 now the third fold is to see what is left 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.530
 here an excess 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.770
 this access we are going to double this 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.770
 way 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.990
 we have this folded in this way 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.330
 and finally 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.360
 on the side you see all the creases 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:55.130
 open here are going to grab one of the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.130
 angles of the triangle and they will take it 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.720
 to an extreme in this way like that 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.080
 let the tip touch here and try 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.680
 that this is right let's flip it 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 to make it look better 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.890
 he explains us in this way and then 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.250
 to repeat this fold but this 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.450
 side with this angle I'm softening 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 a little bit the bottom part to make it 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.500
 easier tubular paper 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.760
 and make sure you're about here 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.760
 touch the paper end 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.830
 what we are almost ready now the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 last two folds if you do not notice 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.900
 here 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.409
 here on the top there are these 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.230
 two paper stamps or folds we are going to 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.020
 make grab this one that is on one side and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.990
 put it down 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.480
 and fold and this one that stays here grab it 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.780
 and put it down the other side and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.780
 achieve 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.800
 and we have our cup made 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.900
 this glass of water and if you will see that 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.170
 they will go on the slow they simply put the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.060
 finger and separate the two sides of paper 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.900
 in the trick of putting the hand of this 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.450
 way to form the cup and soften 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.790
 here this end because it is that the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.460
 extreme where you are going to put your mouth 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.919
 to take as you can see is done in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.010
 a few simple folds have a 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.630
 perfect cup or glass of water I'm going to 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.760
 make an approach to be seen 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.790
 here is the place where you can 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.090
 put your mouth this component is 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.490
 sealed this is the part above by 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.530
 inside and it's the outside part but 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.820
 now to prove to you that if it serves you 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.710
 let's put some water so that 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.910
 see that there is no type of drip 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.340
 to bring it closer than a glass of water 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.810
 let's bring it closer to the camera I'll 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.600
 put a finger under so you can 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.790
 bear the weight 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.790
 and we started to put water 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.330
 never put too much water because of course 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.789
 it's a piece of paper and it's not going to give 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.080
 but as you can see I already put all the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.569
 water and the spear inside the cup 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.550
 perfect you can take there is no 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.090
 type of liquid I will remove the finger 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.090
 so I can see it 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.140
 there is no type of water liquid and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.470
 is perfect but of course this is not going to 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.410
 last a lot to start cleaning 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.290
 maybe in the next 30 or 40 seconds 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.880
 and that's why I recommend you take 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.220
 as soon as possible and not to put much 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.350
 Water 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.880
 well that was all for now I hope that 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.420
 have enjoyed this video and thanks 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.420
 to look
