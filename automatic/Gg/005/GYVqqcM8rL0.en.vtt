not 100% realistic also got finally got

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
not 100% realistic also got finally got
a<00:00:42.300> fuel<00:00:42.540> gauge<00:00:42.570> actually<00:00:43.260> fuel<00:00:43.470> gauge<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
a fuel gauge actually fuel gauge as you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510 
a fuel gauge actually fuel gauge as you
can<00:00:44.250> see<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:46.040> you<00:00:47.040> can<00:00:47.160> thank<00:00:47.370> now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
can see there which you can thank now

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
can see there which you can thank now
James<00:00:47.790> might<00:00:47.970> be<00:00:48.120> free<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.390> creating<00:00:48.930> the

James might be free for creating the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
James might be free for creating the
design<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.650> fuel<00:00:49.980> gauge<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.490> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.850> think

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
design of fuel gauge and you can think

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
design of fuel gauge and you can think
max<00:00:51.330> speed<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.100> almost<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.310> whole<00:00:53.340> fuel

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
max speed for almost the whole fuel

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.040 
max speed for almost the whole fuel
system<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.990> tool<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.440> timer

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you can run out of fuel and you get a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
you can run out of fuel and you get a
quarter<00:01:12.420> tank<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> reserve<00:01:13.020> fuel<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:14.009> you
