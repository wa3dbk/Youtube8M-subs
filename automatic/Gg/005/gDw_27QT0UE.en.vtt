to<00:00:38.410> do<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.770> or<00:00:39.040> you<00:00:39.220> find<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.610> easier<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.059> curl

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
to do that or you find it easier to curl

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.420 
to do that or you find it easier to curl
your<00:00:40.510> hair<00:00:40.809> with<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.050> curling<00:00:41.290> iron<00:00:41.620> then<00:00:42.160> just
