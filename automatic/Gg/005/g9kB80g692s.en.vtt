00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
wrist this morning I think it may be a

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820 
wrist this morning I think it may be a
bit<00:02:22.030> less<00:02:22.510> than<00:02:22.810> playful<00:02:23.290> after<00:02:23.650> this

bit less than playful after this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.870 
bit less than playful after this
afternoon<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:24.520> that's<00:02:24.700> funny

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
afternoon because that's funny

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880 
afternoon because that's funny
disappointing<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:26.020> bear<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.320> mind<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.739> course

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
disappointing but bear in mind of course

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
disappointing but bear in mind of course
that<00:02:27.040> he<00:02:27.220> has<00:02:27.459> got<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> 11th<00:02:28.150> passed<00:02:28.360> this

that he has got the 11th passed this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.570 
that he has got the 11th passed this
time<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.080> unlikely<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.220> he<00:02:30.340> would<00:02:30.489> have

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580
