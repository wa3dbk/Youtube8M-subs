i'm<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.969> showing<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.750> works<00:02:07.580> look

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
i'm just showing off that it works look

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460 
i'm just showing off that it works look
at<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:08.879> i<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.300> move<00:02:09.450> around

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
at me i can move around

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
at me i can move around
all<00:02:10.649> right<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.100> ahead<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.430> exit<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:16.490> so

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
all right and go ahead and exit this so

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.980 
all right and go ahead and exit this so
that<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.240> proof<00:02:18.630> right<00:02:18.780> there<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that is just the proof right there that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.840 
that is just the proof right there that
I've<00:02:19.200> bypassed<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.520> zero<00:02:21.560> 000<00:02:22.850> time

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
I've bypassed it I have zero 000 time

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.790 
I've bypassed it I have zero 000 time
left<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.300> my<00:02:24.420> trial<00:02:25.370> big<00:02:26.370> whoop<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.990> end<00:02:28.710> up

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
left on my trial big whoop and I end up

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.080

going<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:30.890> try<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> find<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.250> match<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
going in to try to find a match but the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.210 
going in to try to find a match but the
matchmaking<00:02:33.570> on<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.560> terrible<00:02:34.860> i

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
matchmaking on this is just terrible i

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.590 
matchmaking on this is just terrible i
mean<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.460> takes<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.820> long<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> find<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> game
