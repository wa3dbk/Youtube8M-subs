about fail and when picking gameplay to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.470 
about fail and when picking gameplay to
showcase<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.800> fail<00:00:17.130> /<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.090> went<00:00:18.300> wrong

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
showcase in a fail / what went wrong

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.410 
showcase in a fail / what went wrong
scenario<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.230> had<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> really<00:00:19.859> hard<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.420> not

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
scenario I had a really hard time not

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.570 
scenario I had a really hard time not
because<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> don't<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.160> any<00:00:23.400> fail

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
because you know I don't have any fail

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
because you know I don't have any fail
captured<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.350> difficult

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
captured just because it's so difficult

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.370 
captured just because it's so difficult
to<00:00:25.890> choose<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.300> fails<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.199> most

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to choose which of my fails is the most

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.470 
to choose which of my fails is the most
relevant<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.670> video<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> thought<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
relevant so for this video I thought I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.080 
relevant so for this video I thought I
would<00:00:30.810> discuss<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.340> general<00:00:32.669> failure

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
would discuss more of a general failure

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
would discuss more of a general failure
on<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.360> part<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> next<00:00:35.219> video

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
on my part and in the next video

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
on my part and in the next video
submission<00:00:36.120> I'll<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.079> game

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270 
failures but in this game I want to talk
about<00:00:41.730> frame<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.329> mind<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.870> gaming<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
about frame of mind when gaming and I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
about frame of mind when gaming and I
feel<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> isn't<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.899> main<00:00:46.140> mistake

and we are playing the sector control
game<00:01:17.430> type<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.570> did<00:01:19.170> help<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.530> capture

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
game type and I did help out capture

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.200 
game type and I did help out capture
some<00:01:20.100> objectives<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> beginning

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
some objectives here in the beginning

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.539 
some objectives here in the beginning
but<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.720> moving<00:01:22.049> around<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.380> map

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
but I'm not moving around this map

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.370 
but I'm not moving around this map
slowly<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> carefully<00:01:23.970> enough<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
slowly and carefully enough and the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.719 
slowly and carefully enough and the
gaming<00:01:25.680> session<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.130> become<00:01:26.400> somewhat

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
gaming session have become somewhat

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
gaming session have become somewhat
frustrating<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.500> doing<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
frustrating and so what I was doing is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
frustrating and so what I was doing is
basically<00:01:29.040> rushing<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.090> moves<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
basically rushing a lot of my moves and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
basically rushing a lot of my moves and
not<00:01:31.229> making<00:01:31.500> good<00:01:31.530> decisions<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.280> when

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
not making good decisions and when

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
not making good decisions and when
things<00:01:33.540> went<00:01:33.720> wrong<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> started<00:01:34.560> taking

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
things went wrong and I started taking

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.520 
things went wrong and I started taking
some<00:01:35.100> deaths<00:01:35.369> rather<00:01:36.119> than<00:01:36.509> reassess<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
some deaths rather than reassess and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950 
some deaths rather than reassess and
slow<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.759> again<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> was

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
slow down because again you know I was

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
slow down because again you know I was
impaired<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.560> decision-making<00:01:41.009> wasn't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
impaired and my decision-making wasn't

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
impaired and my decision-making wasn't
the<00:01:41.610> best<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.030> decided<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.960> rush<00:01:43.229> harder

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the best I decided to just rush harder

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
the best I decided to just rush harder
and<00:01:43.799> hope<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.579> result<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> when

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and hope for a better result and when

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.090 
and hope for a better result and when
you<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.350> things<00:01:46.649> over<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> over

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you do the same things over and over

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
you do the same things over and over
again<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> expect<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> result<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> be

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
they're probably going to know where I

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.289 
they're probably going to know where I
am<00:03:58.419> and<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:59.769> shouldn't<00:04:00.340> push<00:04:00.760> into<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:00.970> enemy
