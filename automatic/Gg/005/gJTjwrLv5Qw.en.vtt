called<00:01:26.250> sheet<00:01:26.580> metal<00:01:26.939> parameters<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.320> bend

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
called sheet metal parameters the bend

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
called sheet metal parameters the bend
radius<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.579> 1<00:01:30.180> millimeter<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
radius here will be 1 millimeter it's a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
radius here will be 1 millimeter it's a
hit<00:01:33.479> tab<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.380> bend<00:01:34.590> allowance<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.220> be

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
now the total length of the flattened

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.670 
now the total length of the flattened
part<00:04:48.510> equals<00:04:49.410> length<00:04:50.130> 1<00:04:50.810> plus<00:04:51.810> lengths<00:04:52.350> to
