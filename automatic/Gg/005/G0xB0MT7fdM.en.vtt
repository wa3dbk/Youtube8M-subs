00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Men do not understand women that is 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.640
 But they do not think anything new now 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.799
 the whole is even now 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.090
 scientifically proven and indeed 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 from the uni bochum 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 a study clearly shows male field 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.549
 Much more difficult looks from women 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 to interpret correctly 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 in men, however, they know immediately 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 what they are what the other person feels and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 Were another slip so for that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.359
 why the gender fight probably never 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359
 end will have 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 It can be so much in a women's view 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.190
 lie for that the body language and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.210
 be pretty clear on the looks 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 Can you really need that? 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.850
 Spoken word no longer what 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 if that looks so attractive if 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 If someone looks at me then you have the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.300
 attention as an eye contact 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.309
 and there is already one 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.309
 misunderstanding between man and woman 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.230
 that is a bad one 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:17.690
 Women are unique 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:19.869
 At least they mean signals in and 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 Accordingly, then look a bit 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.930
 and then you can often do that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.520
 to start what is behind it 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 should 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 Many women give you riddles 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.840
 You can count on a few men right away 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.810
 understand when the eyes rolled away like that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.369
 be bored or so just that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.700
 After 15 years of sight can be undermining 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.649
 his 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.789
 I think it comes with a view 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.030
 appreciation over and if thats 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.090
 You can feel it then it is pleasant 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.890
 how please try appreciation women 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 Schachner watches with her men 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.930
 put and men speak of 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.880
 esteem where are you the men 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.369
 Deep women look right interpret 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 husbands, maybe they are 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.860
 trains with the partner 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.860
 to understand workflows 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.790
 then I see this lightning that is 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:23.260
 So give in to compromise then rest 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:26.290
 and that does not seem to be that hard 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.060
 yes you have to look him eyes and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.319
 I do not smile often 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.319
 because something like this I want to painted 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.829
 I think that works for everyone 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.239
 You just have to go crazy if yes and 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.310
 in our studio is boris schiffer 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.319
 Psychologist at the University Hospital in Bochum 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.900
 you have the study why men women 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.099
 do not understand how published are 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.120
 they, anyway come to the 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.150
 to explore the topic 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.200
 yes that was actually a coincidence 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.379
 it was really about us 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.709
 to find out if violent offenders 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.510
 Difficulties have more 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.609
 difficulties have the emotions in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.919
 to read other people's eyes because 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.310
 that is an important skill in the 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.450
 understanding in social interaction 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.250
 represents and if you do not in the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 situation, it comes to misunderstandings 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.510
 may also be misinterpretation 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.109
 which then trigger reactive violence 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.470
 can 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.519
 and yes it was like that we have none 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.199
 differences between the 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.379
 violent offenders and the controls 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.120
 and then I thought about it 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.949
 how can that be and then have something 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.840
 have looked more closely at the data and have 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.019
 looked if there are differences 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.479
 in the interpretation of positive or 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.000
 negative valent emotional states 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.560
 or in terms of how good the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.120
 people in a position are the emotions in 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.659
 male or female eyes too 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.400
 read 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.709
 and then I just noticed that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.849
 Men a lot more like that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.919
 violent offenders like healthy controls 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.599
 much more difficulties had the 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.310
 emotions in the eyes of women too 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.229
 So recognize a serious 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.079
 background that was behind it 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:01.650
 why is it all right? 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.689
 have noticed that in particular 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.669
 especially a brain areal at the 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.859
 Men were more activated when they were 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.599
 have looked at the eyes of men 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.849
 and that was the amygdala of the almonds 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.919
 and we know from this region that 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.350
 which is very important for the emotions 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:20.660
 regulation for emotion recognition and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.420
 the interpretation goes now that 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 We believe that men are easy in it 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.620
 stronger than other men 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.260
 emotionally involved are emotional 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.970
 Use empathy to recognize emotions 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.010
 and therefore in men to better in 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.620
 the situation is probably as the women 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.120
 more or less this areal from 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.230
 remains is then that men 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.300
 understand each other better 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.170
 as with a woman yes that could be 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.480
 conclude 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.560
 but where does that come from? 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.730
 a statement maybe one too 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.490
 historical explanation 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.640
 yes, yes, it was in earlier times 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.340
 So I'm talking about several thousand now 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.750
 so it's natural for men 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.680
 was much more important 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.010
 survival was in others 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.690
 Men friend or enemy to recognize 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.490
 it was less important to realize what 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.080
 in women is going on because then you have 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.020
 Just pull the call over your head 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.820
 The stage was dragged exaggerated 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.710
 and it is apparently now that way 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.230
 evolution lags a bit behind 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 Of course, these days no longer talk 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.260
 it can be that it is for men 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.940
 more important is the emotions of others 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.710
 men to understand but many 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.530
 men at the female supervisor and that 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.630
 Of course, it is also important 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.800
 understand how the tick 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.370
 that would be my question what can you do 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.080
 one can eventually learn women's looks 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.390
 So you can already be a verbal 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.340
 to understand expressive behavior 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.130
 of course, the eyes are one 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.300
 important source of information others 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.520
 Of course, information sources are in 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.890
 the facial expression the posture 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.440
 and then, of course, situational 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.780
 Aspects to recognize what in the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.770
 other people just what is happening 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.140
 right now you are seeing in my eyes 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.760
 that the conversation ended very good 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.760
 Partie behind many visitors
