00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's my first time these are a bell

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's my first time these are a bell
shape<00:00:42.000> bottom<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> fold<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.969> up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
shape bottom so at when you fold it up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
shape bottom so at when you fold it up
now<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> bottom<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.620> bigger<00:00:46.860> than<00:00:47.160> where

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
now the bottom is bigger than where

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.740

you're<00:00:47.670> sewing<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> too<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.719> doing

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you're sewing it too so what I'm doing

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
you're sewing it too so what I'm doing
is<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.140> stretching<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.340> hopefully<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
is I'm stretching it so that hopefully I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
is I'm stretching it so that hopefully I
won't<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.030> any<00:00:51.270> gather<00:00:55.219> all<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
won't have any gather all right so this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
won't have any gather all right so this
looks<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:57.899> smooth<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.829> worth<00:00:59.039> that

remembered after playing with it for a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
remembered after playing with it for a
few<00:01:46.590> minutes<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.759> heels<00:01:48.000> so
