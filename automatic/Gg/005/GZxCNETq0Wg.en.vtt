00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.369 
a tip today of how to use floral tape
floral<00:00:11.280> tape<00:00:11.490> comes<00:00:11.789> in<00:00:11.999> a<00:00:12.150> wide<00:00:12.389> widths<00:00:13.200> which

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
floral tape comes in a wide widths which

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.020 
floral tape comes in a wide widths which
very<00:00:13.650> often<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.129> sugar<00:00:14.400> flower<00:00:14.610> making<00:00:14.849> is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
very often for sugar flower making is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.720 
very often for sugar flower making is
too<00:00:15.269> wide<00:00:15.539> so<00:00:15.869> we<00:00:16.470> cut<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.949> half<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.610> in

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
too wide so we cut it in half or in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.020 
too wide so we cut it in half or in
quarters<00:00:18.210> using<00:00:19.200> a<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.620> cutter<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.160> this

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
quarters using a little cutter and this

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.000 
quarters using a little cutter and this
will<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.540> cut<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.930> through<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.830> can

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
will actually cut this through you can

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.590 
will actually cut this through you can
also<00:00:23.160> use<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> pair<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> scissors<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.240> this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
also use a pair of scissors but this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.520 
also use a pair of scissors but this
makes<00:00:24.840> life<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.200> lot<00:00:25.350> easier<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.410> we

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
makes life a lot easier and then when we

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.140 
makes life a lot easier and then when we
have<00:00:28.680> got<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> floral<00:00:29.190> tape<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.790> will<00:00:30.000> give

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have got the floral tape this will give

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
have got the floral tape this will give
us<00:00:30.300> half<00:00:30.600> with<00:00:30.870> floral<00:00:31.289> tape

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
us half with floral tape

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.980 
us half with floral tape
now<00:00:32.399> half<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.879> floral<00:00:33.210> tape<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.629> be<00:00:33.660> used

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
now half with floral tape can be used

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.010 
now half with floral tape can be used
for<00:00:34.290> making<00:00:34.730> wrapping<00:00:35.730> flowers<00:00:36.240> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.900> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
for making wrapping flowers a lot of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.100 
for making wrapping flowers a lot of
times<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.560> make<00:00:37.860> sugar<00:00:38.430> flowers<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.090> use<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
times when I make sugar flowers I use a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350 
times when I make sugar flowers I use a
floral<00:00:40.860> tape<00:00:41.100> bud<00:00:41.310> method<00:00:41.790> where<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.060> would

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
floral tape bud method where I would

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.210 
floral tape bud method where I would
take<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.720> floral<00:00:43.020> tape<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> need<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
take the floral tape now I need to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.650 
take the floral tape now I need to
stretch<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> tape<00:00:44.880> to<00:00:45.090> make<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> little

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
stretch the tape to make it a little

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
stretch the tape to make it a little
sticky<00:00:46.020> by<00:00:46.260> opening<00:00:46.560> up<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> pores<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
sticky by opening up the pores of the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
sticky by opening up the pores of the
tape<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.480> wrap<00:00:48.660> around<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.110> end<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
tape and I will wrap around the end of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
tape and I will wrap around the end of
the<00:00:49.860> wire<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:51.060> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.660> around

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the wire and then I'm going to go around

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
the wire and then I'm going to go around
depending<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> size<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> flower<00:00:53.640> ten

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
depending on the size of the flower ten

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.500 
depending on the size of the flower ten
times<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.870> three<00:00:55.500> four<00:00:55.980> five<00:00:56.489> six<00:00:57.030> seven

times two three four five six seven
eight<00:00:57.870> nine<00:00:58.020> ten<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.130> then<00:00:59.700> I<00:00:59.760> will<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
eight nine ten and then I will take a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
eight nine ten and then I will take a
pair<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.390> pliers<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.620> mold<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
pair of pliers and I will then mold this

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
pair of pliers and I will then mold this
around<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.019> form<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.739> small

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
around so I actually form a little small

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
around so I actually form a little small
click<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> end<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.690> will<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:06.960> go

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
click on the end and then I will then go

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
click on the end and then I will then go
around<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.530> additional<00:01:07.979> ten<00:01:08.220> times<00:01:08.580> four<00:01:09.090> five

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
around an additional ten times four five

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.860 
around an additional ten times four five
six<00:01:09.960> seven<00:01:10.590> eight<00:01:10.799> nine<00:01:10.830> ten<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.690> are

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
six seven eight nine ten and when we are

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.660 
six seven eight nine ten and when we are
using<00:01:13.200> floral<00:01:13.799> tape<00:01:14.070> we're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> use

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
using floral tape we're going to use

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
using floral tape we're going to use
this<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.390> knit<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.290> need

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this like you would knit you need

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.130 
this like you would knit you need
tension<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.340> floral<00:01:17.970> tape<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.020> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
tension on your floral tape so then this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.680 
tension on your floral tape so then this
goes<00:01:19.440> on<00:01:19.650> nice<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:19.920> tight<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.540> how

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
goes on nice and tight and this is how

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.899 
goes on nice and tight and this is how
you<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.049> make<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> floral<00:01:23.159> tape<00:01:23.400> bud

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you would make a floral tape bud

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
you would make a floral tape bud
so<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.290> covering<00:01:25.650> wise<00:01:25.950> which

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so then when we are covering wise which

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
so then when we are covering wise which
we<00:01:26.520> often<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.030> sometimes<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.600> use<00:01:27.750> silver<00:01:28.170> wire

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
we often do sometimes we use silver wire

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
we often do sometimes we use silver wire
and<00:01:28.560> cover<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.950> green<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.460> white<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.060> sometimes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and cover it green or white or sometimes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
and cover it green or white or sometimes
when<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.409> certain<00:01:31.770> flowers<00:01:31.979> like

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
when we do certain flowers like

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
when we do certain flowers like
hydrangeas<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.180> Lily<00:01:33.330> LaValley<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.869> actually

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
hydrangeas or Lily LaValley I actually

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
hydrangeas or Lily LaValley I actually
cover<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> wire<00:01:34.890> over<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.790> quarter<00:01:36.150> with

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
cover the wire over with quarter with

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
cover the wire over with quarter with
tape<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> quarter<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.040> tape<00:01:38.280> we're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
tape so with the quarter with tape we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.070 
tape so with the quarter with tape we're
going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> wrap<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> around<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.689> end<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
going to wrap this around the end of the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.899 
going to wrap this around the end of the
wire<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.130> technique<00:01:41.549> we're<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
wire and the technique we're going to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
wire and the technique we're going to
use<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.510> is<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.830> much<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
use here is going to be very much the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
use here is going to be very much the
same<00:01:44.520> keep<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> tension<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> tape<00:01:45.840> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
same keep in tension on the tape but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780 
same keep in tension on the tape but
you're<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.799> pulling<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.310> tape<00:01:47.520> down

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you're actually pulling the tape down

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
you're actually pulling the tape down
and<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.180> stretching<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.900> with<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.350> other

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and I'm stretching this with my other

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.570 
and I'm stretching this with my other
hand

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
hand

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.219 
hand
so<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.240> how<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.390> tape<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.900> coming

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so you can see how the tape is coming

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
so you can see how the tape is coming
down<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.670> cover<00:01:53.939> over

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
down and you're going to just cover over

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
down and you're going to just cover over
the<00:01:54.900> wire<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> come<00:01:56.189> down<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.700> gets

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the wire and as you come down this gets

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.870 
the wire and as you come down this gets
tension<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> wire<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.640> how<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
tension on the wire and this is how you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.929 
tension on the wire and this is how you
would<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.299> cover<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:01.049> wire<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.520> floral

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
would actually cover a wire with floral

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.819 
would actually cover a wire with floral
tape<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.110> will<00:02:04.229> continue<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
tape and you just will continue down to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.710 
tape and you just will continue down to
the<00:02:05.100> bottom<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.150> could<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.509> cut

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
the bottom and then this could be cut

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.419 
the bottom and then this could be cut
into<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.860> making<00:02:08.189> a<00:02:08.220> little

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
into like if I was making a little

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.820 
into like if I was making a little
Valley<00:02:08.700> six<00:02:09.119> sections<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.869> use<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
Valley six sections and use for the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.390 
Valley six sections and use for the
little<00:02:11.160> Valley<00:02:11.310> flowers

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
little Valley flowers

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.130 
little Valley flowers
