00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
look better than just having a hose or a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.660 
look better than just having a hose or a

the<00:02:41.640> hose<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.150> actually<00:02:42.540> heated<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the hose it's actually heated with a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.380 
the hose it's actually heated with a
heat<00:02:43.740> gun<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.640> shrinks<00:02:44.850> down<00:02:45.180> on

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
heat gun and it actually shrinks down on

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
heat gun and it actually shrinks down on
the<00:02:45.510> holes<00:02:45.690> puts<00:02:46.410> dynamic<00:02:46.950> pressure<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.370> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the holes puts dynamic pressure on it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.090 
the holes puts dynamic pressure on it
and<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> does<00:02:48.960> is<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.260> actually<00:02:49.560> gets<00:02:49.770> rid
