00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
seemed that when I would put it on
nightly<00:01:29.780> as<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.170> would<00:01:31.350> toss<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> turn<00:01:32.369> through

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the night my eyelashes would kind of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.789 
the night my eyelashes would kind of
like<00:01:38.060> break<00:01:39.060> almost<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> put

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
like break almost because when you put

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
like break almost because when you put
this<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.280> he<00:01:41.909> makes<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.299> eyelashes<00:01:42.750> very

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this on he makes your eyelashes very

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
this on he makes your eyelashes very
stiff<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> feel<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.790> my<00:01:45.210> eyelashes<00:01:45.810> were

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
stiff so I feel like my eyelashes were

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
stiff so I feel like my eyelashes were
almost<00:01:46.680> breaking<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.420> toss<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> turn

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
almost breaking as I would toss and turn

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.580 
almost breaking as I would toss and turn
throughout<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> night<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> felt<00:01:52.439> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
throughout the night and so I felt like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.959 
throughout the night and so I felt like
this<00:01:52.770> almost<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:55.790> went<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this almost kind of like went the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
this almost kind of like went the
opposite<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:58.049> instead<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.710> helping

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
opposite way like instead of helping

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
opposite way like instead of helping
them<00:01:59.250> grow<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.479> diminished<00:02:01.020> their

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
them grow kind of like diminished their

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
them grow kind of like diminished their
growth<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.159> made<00:02:02.310> them<00:02:02.460> even<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
growth and kind of made them even in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.899 
growth and kind of made them even in
worse<00:02:03.840> condition<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> put<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.460> nightly

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
worse condition when I put it on nightly

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
worse condition when I put it on nightly
but<00:02:06.450> when<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> put<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:06.990> during<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> day<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
but when I put it on during the day I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.089 
but when I put it on during the day I
felt<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> did<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.959> might<00:02:10.410> condition<00:02:11.009> my

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
felt like it did it might condition my

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.660 
felt like it did it might condition my
eyelashes<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.030> better

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
I noticed that my when I use this my

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.810 
I noticed that my when I use this my
mascara<00:05:19.890> like<00:05:20.890> slides<00:05:21.430> on<00:05:21.700> smoothly<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.810> like

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
mascara like slides on smoothly and like

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.310 
mascara like slides on smoothly and like
when<00:05:24.820> I'm<00:05:24.910> not<00:05:25.150> using<00:05:25.420> this<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.930> doesn't<00:05:26.200> work

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
when I'm not using this it doesn't work

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.410 
when I'm not using this it doesn't work
as<00:05:26.500> well<00:05:26.680> my<00:05:26.920> mascara<00:05:27.280> doesn't<00:05:27.490> seem<00:05:27.790> to<00:05:28.000> be<00:05:28.180> as

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
as well my mascara doesn't seem to be as

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.110 
as well my mascara doesn't seem to be as
a<00:05:28.450> nice<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:29.050> like<00:05:29.290> coat<00:05:29.920> my<00:05:30.100> eyelashes<00:05:30.970> as

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.650 
a nice and like coat my eyelashes as
well<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.460> was<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:33.790> think<00:05:34.000> about<00:05:34.270> nine

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
well so this was I think about nine

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.740 
well so this was I think about nine
dollars<00:05:35.140> on<00:05:35.530> Amazon<00:05:36.100> become<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:37.360> really

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
dollars on Amazon become so it's really

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.550 
dollars on Amazon become so it's really
inexpensive<00:05:38.080> as<00:05:38.770> well<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:40.020> for<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.260> between

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
inexpensive as well and for like between

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.360 
inexpensive as well and for like between
this<00:05:42.120> this<00:05:43.120> one<00:05:43.330> this<00:05:43.870> one<00:05:44.080> is<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.710> much<00:05:45.040> better

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
this this one this one is so much better

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.760 
this this one this one is so much better
than<00:05:45.940> any<00:05:46.420> other<00:05:46.630> product<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.260> I<00:05:47.380> have<00:05:47.560> tried

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
than any other product that I have tried

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.770 
than any other product that I have tried
so<00:05:50.770> then<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:51.040> last<00:05:51.250> product<00:05:51.730> was<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.630> most

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
so then the last product was the most

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.910 
so then the last product was the most
expensive<00:05:53.020> product<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:53.620> it<00:05:53.710> was<00:05:53.800> very

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
expensive product and it was very

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.980 
expensive product and it was very
expensive<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.490> was<00:05:54.550> fifty<00:05:55.420> dollars<00:05:55.780> I<00:05:55.930> believe

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
expensive it was fifty dollars I believe

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.550 
expensive it was fifty dollars I believe
and<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.440> was<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.710> rapid<00:05:57.130> lash<00:05:57.480> growth

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
and it was the rapid lash growth

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.450 
and it was the rapid lash growth

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.700 
it's just like a little bit of oil and
there<00:06:24.130> was<00:06:24.220> so<00:06:24.550> little<00:06:24.580> product<00:06:25.420> to<00:06:25.780> I<00:06:26.020> mean<00:06:26.680> I

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
there was so little product to I mean I

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.400 
there was so little product to I mean I
literally<00:06:27.040> went<00:06:27.310> through<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.700> and<00:06:27.940> I<00:06:28.000> think

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
literally went through that and I think

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.050 
literally went through that and I think
like<00:06:29.410> three<00:06:29.800> to<00:06:29.920> four<00:06:30.100> weeks<00:06:30.310> like<00:06:30.700> a<00:06:30.760> month

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
like three to four weeks like a month

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.800 
like three to four weeks like a month
maybe<00:06:31.570> at<00:06:31.810> most<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.860> was<00:06:32.950> gone<00:06:33.450> but<00:06:34.450> this<00:06:34.600> last
