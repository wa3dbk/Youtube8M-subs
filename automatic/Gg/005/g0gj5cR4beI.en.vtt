00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
take care of it a couple of observations

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.649 
take care of it a couple of observations
when<00:01:32.009> using<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.549> tools<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
when using these tools it is a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
when using these tools it is a
high-performance<00:01:34.320> air<00:01:35.009> driven<00:01:35.369> tool<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
high-performance air driven tool so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
high-performance air driven tool so
there's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> vibration<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.590> using

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
there's a lot of vibration when using

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
there's a lot of vibration when using
these<00:01:38.130> tools<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:40.049> tools

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
these tools you can see that these tools

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920 
these tools you can see that these tools
have<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> series<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.670> needles<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
have a series of little needles and this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.440 
have a series of little needles and this
is<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.290> fractures<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> concrete<00:01:44.520> away<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
is what fractures the concrete away so a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
is what fractures the concrete away so a
common<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.280> pre

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
common use for this would be to pre

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.760 
common use for this would be to pre
staying<00:01:48.210> areas<00:01:48.780> whether<00:01:49.049> you're<00:01:49.320> using<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
staying areas whether you're using a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030 
staying areas whether you're using a
reactive<00:01:50.250> acid<00:01:50.670> stain<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.630> many<00:01:51.810> cases<00:01:52.040> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
reactive acid stain or in many cases you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.130 
reactive acid stain or in many cases you
can<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> water-based<00:01:53.939> stain<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.659> bright

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
can use a water-based stain for bright

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.670 
can use a water-based stain for bright
vibrant<00:01:55.409> colors<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:56.700> dry<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
vibrant colors that would dry and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.270 
vibrant colors that would dry and
preferably<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:58.979> even<00:01:59.159> consider

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
preferably you would even consider

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
preferably you would even consider
sealing<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> simply<00:02:00.840> stand<00:02:01.290> on

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
sealing it and then you simply stand on

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.300

dust where the proper dust mask and like

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.760 
dust where the proper dust mask and like
I<00:02:41.340> said<00:02:41.400> they<00:02:42.060> are<00:02:42.090> noisy<00:02:42.990> at<00:02:43.110> times<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.620> go

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
I said they are noisy at times so go

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.860 
I said they are noisy at times so go
ahead<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:43.950> protect<00:02:44.400> your<00:02:44.490> ears<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.360> last<00:02:45.570> tip

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
ahead and protect your ears one last tip

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.200 
ahead and protect your ears one last tip
it<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> great<00:02:47.010> idea<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.400> consider<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.180> use

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
it is a great idea to consider the use

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.540 
it is a great idea to consider the use
of<00:02:48.420> leather<00:02:48.930> gloves<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.740> when<00:02:50.160> using

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
of leather gloves because when using

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.310 
of leather gloves because when using
these<00:02:50.670> tools<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> vibration

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
these tools there is a lot of vibration

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
these tools there is a lot of vibration
that<00:02:52.920> occurs<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.150> could<00:02:54.330> transmit

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
that occurs and so that could transmit

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.350 
that occurs and so that could transmit
into<00:02:55.470> your<00:02:55.620> hands<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> use<00:02:56.760> some

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
into your hands so I do like to use some

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.060 
into your hands so I do like to use some
gloves<00:02:57.630> when<00:02:57.900> working<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.350> these<00:02:58.560> tools<00:02:58.830> as

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
gloves when working with these tools as
