as I remember it never saw the sequel so

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.389 
as I remember it never saw the sequel so
this<00:01:31.750> was<00:01:31.899> actually<00:01:32.020> my<00:01:32.740> first<00:01:32.920> time<00:01:33.099> seeing

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
the problem with Kronk's New Groove I

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.060 
the problem with Kronk's New Groove I
believe<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.820> that<00:05:43.000> it<00:05:43.270> recycles<00:05:44.080> too<00:05:44.620> many<00:05:44.830> of

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
believe is that it recycles too many of

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.400 
believe is that it recycles too many of
the<00:05:45.310> jokes<00:05:45.610> from<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.850> first<00:05:46.180> movie<00:05:46.570> which

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
the jokes from the first movie which

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.110 
the jokes from the first movie which
sort<00:05:47.890> of<00:05:47.980> read<00:05:48.160> tools<00:05:48.430> them<00:05:48.670> to<00:05:48.760> fit<00:05:48.940> his

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
sort of read tools them to fit his

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.970 
sort of read tools them to fit his
character<00:05:49.600> it<00:05:49.780> doesn't<00:05:50.080> really<00:05:50.170> work<00:05:50.470> um

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
character it doesn't really work um

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.460 
character it doesn't really work um
there's<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.640> couple<00:05:51.670> good<00:05:52.360> laughs<00:05:52.660> but<00:05:53.050> again

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
there's a couple good laughs but again

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.050 
there's a couple good laughs but again
it's<00:05:53.650> not<00:05:53.980> as<00:05:54.160> funny<00:05:54.400> as<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.700> birds<00:05:54.910> New

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.140 
it's not as funny as that birds New
Groove<00:05:55.240> which<00:05:55.630> again<00:05:55.990> is<00:05:56.290> hilarious<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:57.460> it

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
Groove which again is hilarious so it

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.850 
Groove which again is hilarious so it
really<00:05:58.450> pales<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:58.960> comparison<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.740> is

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
really pales in comparison it is

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.380 
really pales in comparison it is
interesting<00:06:00.190> to<00:06:00.400> note<00:06:00.640> that<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:01.000> entire

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
interesting to note that the entire

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.120 
interesting to note that the entire
voice<00:06:01.720> cast<00:06:02.080> came<00:06:02.320> back<00:06:02.530> for<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.830> movie

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
voice cast came back for that movie

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.760 
voice cast came back for that movie
which<00:06:03.670> is<00:06:03.880> nice<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.930> animation<00:06:05.440> is<00:06:05.530> up<00:06:05.650> to

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
which is nice and the animation is up to

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.320 
which is nice and the animation is up to
par<00:06:05.920> at<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.190> first<00:06:06.400> point<00:06:06.640> but<00:06:06.910> it<00:06:07.270> just

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
par at the first point but it just

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.650 
par at the first point but it just
doesn't<00:06:08.050> deliver<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.920> laughs<00:06:09.220> and<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:10.000> heart

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
doesn't deliver the laughs and the heart

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.260 
doesn't deliver the laughs and the heart
the<00:06:10.960> first<00:06:11.110> film<00:06:11.500> had<00:06:11.710> so<00:06:12.070> I'd<00:06:12.700> say<00:06:12.940> Kronk's

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
the first film had so I'd say Kronk's

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.730 
the first film had so I'd say Kronk's
New<00:06:13.330> Groove<00:06:13.450> is<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.780> bit<00:06:13.990> of<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.140> disappointment

and<00:06:15.010> it's<00:06:15.790> a<00:06:15.940> real<00:06:16.090> shame<00:06:16.120> so<00:06:16.720> that's<00:06:17.170> it<00:06:17.410> for

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
and it's a real shame so that's it for

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.410 
and it's a real shame so that's it for
