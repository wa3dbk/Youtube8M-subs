this page and this is Thunderbird 5 and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.900 
this page and this is Thunderbird 5 and
it's<00:00:17.520> kind<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> main<00:00:18.000> control<00:00:18.660> sent<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> bit

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
it's kind of main control sent a bit

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
it's kind of main control sent a bit
like<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.449> something<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.080> earth

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
it's kind of like one of those pizza

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.019 
it's kind of like one of those pizza
delivery<00:00:24.180> things<00:00:24.510> knows<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
delivery things knows that is kind of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.950 
delivery things knows that is kind of
this<00:00:27.029> foam<00:00:27.830> kind<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.269> pizza<00:00:30.269> things<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
this foam kind of pizza things that you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040 
this foam kind of pizza things that you
get<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.149> trickier<00:00:33.690> then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
get and then this is a bit trickier then

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
get and then this is a bit trickier then
around<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.860> you've<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> quite<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
around here you've got this is quite a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.190 
around here you've got this is quite a
lot<00:00:39.629> trickier<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:41.000> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> coil

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
lot trickier this bit this is a coil

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
lot trickier this bit this is a coil
kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> thing<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.340> originally<00:00:45.140> in<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
kind of thing I think originally in the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
kind of thing I think originally in the
model<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.640> probably<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.030> coil

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
model of it it's it's probably a coil

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.290 
model of it it's it's probably a coil
from<00:00:48.480> an<00:00:48.600> old<00:00:48.750> TV<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.410> something<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
from an old TV or something like that

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.080 
from an old TV or something like that
because<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.820> built<00:00:53.820> those

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
because that's how they built those

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
because that's how they built those
things<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.199> they've<00:00:55.410> built<00:00:55.620> these

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
things that you know they've built these

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.470 
things that you know they've built these
models<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> bits<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> our<00:00:56.879> electronic

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
models out of bits of our electronic

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.970 
models out of bits of our electronic
equipment<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> to<00:01:00.120> make<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.449> look

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
equipment I think and to make them look

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
equipment I think and to make them look
cool<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> industrial<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> that's<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cool and industrial so that's kind of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.289 
cool and industrial so that's kind of
going<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.860> through<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.299> we've

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
going all the way through and then we've

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.410 
going all the way through and then we've
got<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.130> wind<00:01:11.130> days<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.790> control<00:01:12.210> room

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
got the wind days the control room

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.850 
got the wind days the control room
windows<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.760> you've<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:14.939> three<00:01:15.509> little

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
windows there you've got three little

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.539 
windows there you've got three little
boxes<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.259> side<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.189> thing<00:01:20.400> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
boxes on the side there and a thing that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.140 
boxes on the side there and a thing that
looks<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> screwdriver<00:01:21.540> sticking<00:01:22.259> here

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
looks like a screwdriver sticking here

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
looks like a screwdriver sticking here
so<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.250> we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so what it is really on the top here we

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
so what it is really on the top here we
got<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:27.020> observation<00:01:28.020> domes<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
got two little observation domes and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.260 
got two little observation domes and
then<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.170> kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> telescope

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
then what looks like a kind of telescope

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.429 
then what looks like a kind of telescope
kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> dome<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:35.270> down<00:01:36.270> below<00:01:36.299> you've<00:01:37.229> got

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
kind of dome there down below you've got

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.190 
kind of dome there down below you've got
all<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:39.860> dubbings<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.869> some<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
all this dubbings with a some kind of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.249 
all this dubbings with a some kind of
satellite<00:01:43.500> receiving<00:01:44.220> dish<00:01:44.670> thing<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
satellite receiving dish thing there and

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.480 
satellite receiving dish thing there and
then<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.950> need<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.280> come<00:01:50.579> around<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
then we need to come around like that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.710 
then we need to come around like that
make<00:01:53.490> sure<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.909> became<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> an

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
make sure that this became more of an

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
make sure that this became more of an
angle<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.350> doesn't<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.240> that's<00:01:57.240> sort<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
angle really doesn't it that's sort of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
angle really doesn't it that's sort of
coming<00:01:57.659> down<00:02:00.049> little<00:02:01.049> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.409> block<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
coming down little kind of block on the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.960 
coming down little kind of block on the
end<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:02.790> got<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> five<00:02:03.450> there

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
end there got the five there

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.710 
end there got the five there
in<00:02:06.970> fact<00:02:07.210> those<00:02:07.420> are<00:02:07.540> going<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:08.110> way<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
in fact those are going that way you

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.080 
in fact those are going that way you
know<00:02:10.869> some<00:02:11.170> strange<00:02:11.830> construction<00:02:12.790> about

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
know some strange construction about

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.090 
know some strange construction about
there<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.360> these<00:02:19.500> radiate<00:02:20.500> dish<00:02:20.800> kind

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
there and then these radiate dish kind

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100 
there and then these radiate dish kind
of<00:02:21.250> things<00:02:21.460> what<00:02:21.640> they<00:02:21.820> can't<00:02:22.210> any<00:02:22.540> kind<00:02:23.020> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
of things what they can't any kind of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.450 
of things what they can't any kind of
things<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:25.710> little<00:02:26.710> bit<00:02:26.860> hanging<00:02:27.160> on

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
things like that a little bit hanging on

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.380 
things like that a little bit hanging on
the<00:02:27.610> end<00:02:27.760> there

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
the end there

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.810 
the end there
okay<00:02:29.380> let's<00:02:29.590> draw<00:02:29.770> these<00:02:29.950> little<00:02:30.280> bits<00:02:30.460> in<00:02:30.640> on

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
okay let's draw these little bits in on

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.380 
okay let's draw these little bits in on
the<00:02:30.970> top<00:02:31.210> first

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the top first

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.980 
the top first
these<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.540> been<00:02:34.660> little<00:02:34.990> glass<00:02:35.230> domes

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
these have been little glass domes

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:48.810 
these have been little glass domes
Plexiglas<00:02:38.040> probably<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:47.610> draw<00:02:48.610> in

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
Plexiglas probably and then draw in

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.480 
Plexiglas probably and then draw in
these<00:02:49.000> little<00:02:49.200> box<00:02:50.200> things<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.440> side<00:02:53.860> and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
side somebody stabbed it with a
