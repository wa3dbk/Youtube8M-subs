00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 and welcome to 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.569
 a new episode in the last corner of the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.820
 clans and today there are interesting 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.170
 I wanted and I had news on the one hand 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.849
 also said to the last video again 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 sorry for the micro today yes 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
 is how the right is evaluated to me 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.080
 So far , that happened twice 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 if you run while the program is running 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 usb-port out put back in it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 then the micro did not turn around then did 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.140
 was unfortunately see the internal left 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.810
 the last time a sound so bad 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.880
 but today again in the usual good 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 quality as I would say and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 of course I wanted you to start 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.880
 inform as if now the ten 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 Going out against ten small is now 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 already based on the clear advantages can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 to make first suspicions and we 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.370
 have a 19 to 14 here 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 Of course, in the end, very white get something 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 I liked the war bonus 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 900 12,000 4140 dark so there you can 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 Do something right and you have to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 say we used all attacks 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
 they used 19 out of 20 so they were 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 we simply the clear one to my 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 Pace has funnily nobody ran 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.440
 married 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.940
 all other bases were attacked 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.589
 do that was brought 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 monsters ground brought and moritz 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.710
 was felled so have two bosses 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.530
 which in that case are not spotted and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.080
 as well as here on the basis of the rewards 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.130
 see, we have all the points the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.330
 means we have ministers everywhere 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 monster fetched when we over again 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.680
 go to the one of the start of holsten 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.659
 scottin then we have three 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.259
 stars and otherwise stars and im 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 lower area 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
 her yes waiting attending to one or 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 other priest so two pieces 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.229
 network and it was my very different 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.490
 experience so i really have to say 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.290
 it was somehow more relaxed 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.150
 it was quieter by the fact that not so 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 many were there you had to be okay 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.750
 people who are here are 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.439
 reliable we will attack the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.939
 donate 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.049
 So we had to clear this example 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.070
 not even the reminder emails 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.229
 write that you please the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 should make full slapstick from his 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.930
 down because it's one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.950
 Of course, there you can 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 sometimes people say that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.790
 were already part of the hard core 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 So you know that's good 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.159
 does it was fun the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.530
 ran around 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.310
 Of course, in the beginning or me 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 it was about that a bit 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 Startled when you face them 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.930
 it was shit, it is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.969
 less well could total are 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.399
 only get 30 stalls and we have it 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.700
 19:20 what I've been so cool about 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.879
 a toaster 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.170
 Altogether ratio but so everything ok 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.200
 I think so for that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.910
 enemy clan 52 soundless 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.239
 had and also is a small group 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.780
 now even ten, and we only 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.819
 27 that are really happy with 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.660
 the result and accordingly 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.760
 I got the hat 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.709
 as a reward and yes you see everything here 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.390
 At least with me the elixir thing 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.650
 is because with the money happened with the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 gold is this happened here i have it 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.799
 yesterday started nixdorf level 2 have 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.590
 said that brings now also on 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.090
 Stage 3 that all are on level 3 and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.849
 then I continue with the infernos 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.349
 on level 2 and alex your still has one 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.519
 be little saved again 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.480
 are a few brands of video again 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.069
 we also we do today will be times 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.680
 look like the lupo currently in 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.299
 Crystal 2 is 7.5 million I need 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.790
 still with me this little sweet 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.930
 when you can toast the magician and it 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.239
 is running small again and this time 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.799
 which I am very happy s last most 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.260
 from many months there are months yes 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.880
 many months ago against one 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.530
 German clan I do not know how far 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.819
 who follow me or what then 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.170
 so that the people under the videos 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.940
 I will be commenting on all 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.079
 I also can not try 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
 I promise to make that clear 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.040
 minimum one maybe even two videos 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.049
 because I just think against 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480
 German is it something else and 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.620
 we have it here 28 years mclaren 33 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.430
 that pretty much made up for it 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.780
 if you look at the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.980
 Descriptions read this pulls 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.389
 but after a professional 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.090
 organization 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.799
 established since 513 they have record low 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
 pokale smart construction gloss you have 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.670
 Feierabend rudel and wolfsrudel bau &amp; 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.910
 Clank is on Tuesdays at 20 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.930
 Clock 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.450
 because we have the last one 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.590
 nevertheless, the ten went against ten 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.510
 we also made against 20:00 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.859
 started and yes see there it was 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.780
 German opponents and before that it was the 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.859
 creeping so we said the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.780
 will probably do so now 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.329
 that we will not be the next time he does 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.519
 around 17 18 but rather at 19:20 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.290
 watch the tournament so the first successes 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.579
 if you want to call it for the better 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.560
 and I'm really curious how 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.940
 give that clear in the end and I am 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.780
 it also curious what the courage makes us 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.370
 have a tactic strong on barbarians 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.500
 because I donated a lot of bows 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.720
 have both heroes at the start and in the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.000
 We have a clear focus for that 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.019
 have a few bow and yes after 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.489
 long time again 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.560
 I think it is completely different from each other 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.390
 Interesting look something 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.440
 so in crystal 2 with rates level 10 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.880
 So I'm in the last one 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.720
 stream 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:31.300
 or you hello my friend hello there 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.230
 at the same time to keywords and then 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.070
 Actually, I'll continue right away 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.630
 actually wanted to say 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.700
 in bow then I have to say here 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.710
 to handle something with a bit of squeamish 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.600
 it then more must barbarians here 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.910
 think but that's it that it was 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.220
 It 's just as nice as it is 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.510
 wants 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.610
 It has been placed outside but it is here 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.230
 divided into a few areas that is in 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.910
 the case really not tragic in 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.190
 golden ax her and we can 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.750
 really wonderful and me 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.730
 think from the side of the machine as 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.050
 Also have a look and look with our 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.190
 heroes and everything and see what we do 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.920
 can reach as far as we come in 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.730
 I think I might even do it 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.370
 be inside 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.860
 here it is still a few troops 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.990
 outside the army camp pick that we're there 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.220
 get a few extra percent and 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.200
 then at the end even the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.770
 Archer Queen Igniting and Looking 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.840
 if you do not know if I have it 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.940
 left the two drill ignored here 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.900
 My main thing I give to so small 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.950
 cat the nose ran no at the old center 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.170
 Hang on, I'm coming in 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.720
 The bowmen should cancel here 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.280
 in any case with tidying up 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.170
 Together, coach king and I think 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.710
 The town hall today is about to follow 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.120
 be inside 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.650
 they are first about true 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.360
 Turn off kings so that's ours 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.130
 has survived archer company 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.150
 not yet focused the city hall cars 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.250
 then take the case also directly times 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.960
 it is still a bit dark 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.280
 As a small reward export are here 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.890
 So void of which we have no 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.150
 have fear and now have that too 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.810
 city ​​hall now there is no 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.480
 more reason 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.110
 come now break off then today 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.090
 loaded well 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.370
 to try after a few and we 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.530
 Of course you get the 50,000 bonus in 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.210
 crystal second also very neat 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.510
 is pretty good and now can then 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.640
 also slowly the clear words 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.710
 It's my favorite five guys 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.190
 Men have paid attention but what 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.570
 does that mean 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.860
 Clear that a bit behind that 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.810
 means it is a bit reduced 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.310
 Apartment block produced pairs said 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.930
 made before the bent mate told 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.820
 Power on the baker's drive said 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.250
 in the fight makes the fries no we do 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.820
 Now the magic to which I am pleased 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.760
 for ten days 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.180
 runs well and live in the 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.350
 stream 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.660
 of course, have a little bit 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.100
 resources around trainees 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.230
 but we can always be like that 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.640
 group opponents watch green boss 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.780
 right answer i am here at six 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.960
 so also the six must be placed 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.180
 attack 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.720
 I do not quite know how I do 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.800
 have to look you see you one 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.840
 mediocre city ​​hall team base walls 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.250
 all on seven heroes 17 and 10 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.130
 remove that I had two xbox 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.120
 only for a clear castle would be on two 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.680
 theoretically feasible 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.360
 probably it will run on one again 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.620
 good tactics out there that ins 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.490
 Zentrum Rhein is doing well 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.200
 a little tuition 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.360
 but I have to be more specific 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.870
 look and why it's still there from alexei 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.840
 it is a small brook now it is gone 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.190
 have something still visible 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.410
 I'm still in the foam with something 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.190
 I'm currently reaching 27,000 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.470
 I do not have that far yet 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.640
 I can train two golems 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.810
 then I have three as well as when I'm for 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.820
 decide on a classic formation 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.030
 should and with the magic year 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.200
 you see is sometimes even a job 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.580
 I already have a foothold and train 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.890
 then have my collection now 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.240
 but little to produce on stage 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.800
 12 he works really well 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.230
 In the worst case, he gets it 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.310
 Shoe production 3500 per hour 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:47.260
 six times that one at 20,000 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.250
 about and it will be up tonight 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.820
 also make I'll be there again in 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.530
 nearly 200,000 so enough resources around 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.000
 then to be able to train jo 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.530
 would say that's it from today 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.780
 Video again, a small load 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.370
 Attack I hope you liked it 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.900
 and I'm curious how it is against ours 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.850
 German opponents let me take the names 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.440
 however, a man affected wolfsrudel 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.640
 if you liked it probably no 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.720
 thumb up there if he does not have a video 

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.460
 Of course, they also wanted to miss more 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.360
 an abo and we see each other but maximum 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.360
 again, it'll be good until then
