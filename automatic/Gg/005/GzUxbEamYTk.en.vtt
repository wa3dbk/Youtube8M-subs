an adapter that allows us to do either

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.190 
an adapter that allows us to do either
one<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> start<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.299> we'll<00:01:39.570> choose<00:01:39.960> the

three<00:01:40.500> inch<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.950> show<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.490> these

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
three inch to show you how these

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
three inch to show you how these
adapters<00:01:42.750> work<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:45.090> adapter<00:01:45.570> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
adapters work and the adapter just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
adapters work and the adapter just
simply<00:01:46.290> slips<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.430> only<00:01:47.549> go<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.850> one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
simply slips over it can only go on one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
simply slips over it can only go on one
way<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.869> matching<00:01:49.350> arrows<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:53.009> tell

to release these and they are these two
little<00:02:06.550> these<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.570> these<00:02:07.750> little<00:02:07.990> prongs

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
little these are these little prongs

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.760 
little these are these little prongs
that<00:02:08.619> will<00:02:08.920> unlock<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.690> slide<00:02:10.960> it<00:02:11.140> off<00:02:11.700> okay<00:02:13.770> so

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
that will unlock to slide it off okay so

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.510 
that will unlock to slide it off okay so
we've<00:02:14.890> snap<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:16.800> pick<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.980> other<00:02:18.130> end<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
we've snap it on pick the other end of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.290 
we've snap it on pick the other end of
the<00:02:18.640> spindle

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the spindle

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.450 
the spindle
and<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:20.410> snap<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.680> adapter<00:02:26.460> gently

and again snap on the adapter gently

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.460 
and again snap on the adapter gently
always<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> spindle<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.330> gray<00:02:31.780> part

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
always and the spindle the the gray part

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.470 
always and the spindle the the gray part
of<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> spindle<00:02:32.950> matches<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.209> gray

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
of the spindle matches up with the gray

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.610 
of the spindle matches up with the gray
side<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.740> spindle<00:02:36.040> holder<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:38.350> black

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
side of the spindle holder and the black

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.800 
side of the spindle holder and the black
side<00:02:39.040> matches<00:02:39.670> up<00:02:39.820> with<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> black<00:02:40.270> side<00:02:40.540> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
side matches up with the black side so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.050 
side matches up with the black side so
that's<00:02:40.930> pretty<00:02:41.290> straight<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.950> therefore<00:02:42.910> we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
that's pretty straight and therefore we

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.110 
that's pretty straight and therefore we
want<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.420> paper<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.840> roll<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.459> front<00:02:46.890> so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
want the paper to roll to the front so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
want the paper to roll to the front so
you'll<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.420> back<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.959> handful<00:02:50.830> of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you'll do this back with a handful of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:03.800 
you'll do this back with a handful of
times<00:02:51.190> at<00:02:51.550> first<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:52.900> ever<00:02:53.140> again

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.690 

and<00:03:04.350> there<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:04.950> push<00:03:05.310> them<00:03:05.520> together

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and there we go just push them together

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.720 
and there we go just push them together

and they squeeze and hold it drop that

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.270 
and they squeeze and hold it drop that
in<00:03:08.940> gently<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.910> pull<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.300> paper<00:03:12.480> out<00:03:13.280> now

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
paper settings and we'll move to in this

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.190 
paper settings and we'll move to in this
case<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.890> proofing<00:04:39.370> paper<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.870> they<00:04:41.050> have

automatic and then you have three
choices<00:05:58.960> for<00:05:59.500> alignment

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
choices for alignment

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.000 
choices for alignment
this<00:06:00.580> will<00:06:00.760> really<00:06:00.940> tune<00:06:01.450> your<00:06:01.780> heads<00:06:02.050> up<00:06:02.350> you

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
this will really tune your heads up you

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
do the Uni D a directional

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.710 
do the Uni D a directional
uni-directional

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
uni-directional

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.250 
uni-directional
first<00:06:08.260> and<00:06:08.830> then<00:06:09.640> complete<00:06:10.180> it<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.780> go<00:06:11.020> back

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
first and then complete it and go back

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.350

to the bi-directional all second so you

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.159 
to the bi-directional all second so you
have<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.889> separate<00:06:18.819> head<00:06:19.150> alignments<00:06:19.990> that

just select it and hit print and the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.089
