welcome<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.149> rustic<00:00:03.449> garden<00:00:03.780> today<00:00:04.140> I

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
welcome to the rustic garden today I

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.889 
welcome to the rustic garden today I
wanted<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> talk<00:00:04.650> about<00:00:04.680> cucumbers<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
wanted to talk about cucumbers a

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.259 
wanted to talk about cucumbers a
magnesium<00:00:06.899> deficiency<00:00:07.970> which<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
magnesium deficiency which is a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.020 
magnesium deficiency which is a
yellowing<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> leaves<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.670> hopefully

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
yellowing of the leaves and hopefully

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.250 
yellowing of the leaves and hopefully
you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.530> see<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> here<00:00:14.960> tomatoes<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
you can see it in here tomatoes and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.490 
you can see it in here tomatoes and
cucumbers<00:00:16.830> will<00:00:17.039> start<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.789> blotchy

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
cucumbers will start to get a blotchy

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.130 
cucumbers will start to get a blotchy
yellow<00:00:19.500> color<00:00:19.740> throughout<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.779> leave<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
yellow color throughout the leave you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.000 
yellow color throughout the leave you
can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.670> picture<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
can see it in this picture and that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
can see it in this picture and that
yellowing<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.180> often<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> sign<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
yellowing is often the sign of a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.380 
yellowing is often the sign of a
magnesium<00:00:28.590> deficiency<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.060> start<00:00:30.330> at

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
magnesium deficiency and if you start at

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.120 
magnesium deficiency and if you start at
the<00:00:30.480> top<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> cucumber<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> leaves<00:00:31.890> tend

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the top of the cucumber the leaves tend

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
the top of the cucumber the leaves tend
to<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.430> green<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.480> magnesium<00:00:33.809> deficiencies

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to be green the magnesium deficiencies

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.990 
to be green the magnesium deficiencies
and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> yellowing<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> leaves<00:00:35.399> usually

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and the yellowing of the leaves usually

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
and the yellowing of the leaves usually
start<00:00:36.270> from<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> bottom<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.410> work<00:00:37.770> your

start from the bottom as you work your
way<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.500> here's<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> good

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
way down you can see here's a good

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.700 
way down you can see here's a good
example<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:42.360> cucumber<00:00:42.870> leaf<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.379> getting

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
example a cucumber leaf that's getting

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.569 
example a cucumber leaf that's getting
yellowing<00:00:44.160> throughout<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.370> see

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
yellowing throughout it and you can see

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.790 
yellowing throughout it and you can see
it<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.620> down

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.100 

let's<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.850> let<00:00:53.969> me<00:00:54.000> walk<00:00:54.420> over<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> here

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
let's see well let me walk over to here

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
let's see well let me walk over to here
on<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> other<00:00:55.739> side<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> cucumber<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
on the other side that can cucumber you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
on the other side that can cucumber you
can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.719> damage<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> work<00:00:58.949> your

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
can see more damage and as you work your

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.630 
can see more damage and as you work your
way<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.250> you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:01.410> damage<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
way down you can see more damage now the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
way down you can see more damage now the
first<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.210> thought<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.559> know<00:01:04.650> maybe

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
first thing I thought was you know maybe

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
first thing I thought was you know maybe
there's<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> blight<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.570> virus<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
there's some kind of blight or virus I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.179 
there's some kind of blight or virus I
don't<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
don't think that it's that I'm going to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.380 
don't think that it's that I'm going to
come<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:16.280> clear

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
come around because it's a very clear

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.490 
come around because it's a very clear
yellowing<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.600> starting<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> happen<00:01:19.200> all

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
yellowing that's starting to happen all

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
yellowing that's starting to happen all
throughout<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.009> cucumber<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:21.450> damaged

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
throughout the cucumber also damaged

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.649 
throughout the cucumber also damaged
along<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> engines<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:24.180> tends<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
along the engines and that tends to be

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.450 
along the engines and that tends to be
more<00:01:25.229> associated<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.920> magnesium

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
more associated with magnesium

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
more associated with magnesium
deficiency<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.799> could<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.920> wrong<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.369> I'm

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
deficiency I could be wrong but I'm

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.050 
deficiency I could be wrong but I'm
going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:33.030> best

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going to start with that and the best

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.740 
going to start with that and the best
way<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> treat<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:35.240> Epsom<00:01:36.240> salt<00:01:36.540> which

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
way to treat it is with Epsom salt which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
way to treat it is with Epsom salt which
is<00:01:36.900> magnesium<00:01:37.229> sulfate<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.119> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is magnesium sulfate and you can just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
is magnesium sulfate and you can just
buy<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:41.030> Epsom<00:01:42.030> salt<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.890> grocery

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
buy the Epsom salt just at your grocery

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060 
buy the Epsom salt just at your grocery
store<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.670> cost<00:01:44.939> about<00:01:45.149> two<00:01:45.390> dollars<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
store this cost about two dollars the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
store this cost about two dollars the
best<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> treat<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:48.000> cucumbers<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> they

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
best way to treat your cucumbers if they

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840 
best way to treat your cucumbers if they
have<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> yellowing<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.860> their<00:01:50.460> leaves<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
have that yellowing on their leaves and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
have that yellowing on their leaves and
again<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.390> start<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> bottom<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
again it will start at the bottom and it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
again it will start at the bottom and it
will<00:01:52.439> affect<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.820> whole<00:01:53.850> leaf<00:01:54.240> you'll<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
will affect the whole leaf you'll just

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
will affect the whole leaf you'll just
see<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.829> green<00:01:56.070> starting<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> turn<00:01:56.820> yellow<00:01:57.060> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
see the green starting to turn yellow in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.440 
see the green starting to turn yellow in
places<00:01:59.780> in<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> best<00:02:01.229> way

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
places in the best way

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.779 
places in the best way
to<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.229> deal<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> mix<00:02:05.460> two

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
to really deal with it is to mix two

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.040 
to really deal with it is to mix two
tablespoons<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:08.369> Epsom<00:02:08.910> salt<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.660> gallon

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
tablespoons of Epsom salt in one gallon

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
tablespoons of Epsom salt in one gallon
of<00:02:10.140> water<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.519> create<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.000> foliar

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of water and you just create a foliar

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.270

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
can you don't need a sprayer for this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.990 
can you don't need a sprayer for this
but<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.069> two<00:02:17.250> tablespoons<00:02:17.760> per

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
soak all the leaves I soaked these

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.710 
soak all the leaves I soaked these
cucumbers<00:02:24.599> two<00:02:25.110> days<00:02:25.349> ago<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:27.390> seem<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
cucumbers two days ago and they seem to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.800 
cucumbers two days ago and they seem to
be<00:02:28.549> holding<00:02:29.549> their<00:02:29.910> own<00:02:29.940> I'll<00:02:30.390> know<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
be holding their own I'll know in a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.470 
be holding their own I'll know in a
couple<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.170> days<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.370> Epsom<00:02:32.910> salts<00:02:33.209> really

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
couple of days if the Epsom salts really

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.140 
couple of days if the Epsom salts really
made<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> difference<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:35.370> again<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> best<00:02:35.940> way

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
made a difference but again the best way

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.880 
made a difference but again the best way
to<00:02:36.180> deal<00:02:36.450> with<00:02:36.599> yellowing<00:02:36.989> leaves<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.650> use

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
to deal with yellowing leaves is to use

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220 
to deal with yellowing leaves is to use
magnesium<00:02:38.430> sulfate<00:02:39.060> which<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.510> buy<00:02:39.660> at
