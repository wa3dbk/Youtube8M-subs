00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.870
 lately the real devalued itself to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.760
 inflation rose the stock market ibovespa fell 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.800
 now you are recovering then the staff 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.590
 was very pessimistic about the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.710
 Brazil but now the thing of a reverses 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 so I'll do a size analysis 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.650
 from the fall of Brazil a weighted analysis 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's not going either way 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.500
 Good, then, the fall of Brazil. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.300
 happened the devaluation of the real did 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.579
 with which the pib of Brazil in dollars 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 with this we lost positions in the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.730
 world ranking 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 so before the world really Brazil 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 it is not as much as it was in the past 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 This is the truth here so I brought 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 by fmi both imf published have some 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 ten 15 days today numbers have economic 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 October now outlook 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.390
 here are the main competitors of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.930
 Brazil up these tones are the 35 is 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 france italy and united kingdom this one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 is canada tac is a rich country but he 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.049
 is he behaving in a position 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 between the rich and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.030
 emerging markets because the rich in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 commodities and here are the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 emergency from russia to india or brazil 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.060
 then the three with account the forecast of the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 fmi after a long time is that russia 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 will pass Brazil and India that was the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 goldman sacks big bet is not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.560
 doing as well as India 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 Brazil has a fall tone 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 So, there 's Brazil up there and catch. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.509
 Since 1980 people are coming up 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.189
 only lately in the last 2011 to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.590
 here we are developing a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.070
 game that we won from 2002 to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.130
 2011 rich countries come in a fall 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 strong is mainly here after the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.350
 break the lehman ball until a little before 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.479
 huh 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.490
 but now the intensity of the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.740
 This is the fall that is the forecast but 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 continue to fall and 10 agents will 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.570
 keep going up and canada 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.299
 is practically retaining the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.280
 where are you here then I just got the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.319
 Brazil, we saw what happened. 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 What happened to Brazil since 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.120
 major crisis is that of 1980 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.970
 in 1984 the great external debt crisis 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.510
 Can we notice that Brazil has gone up? 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.000
 tam 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 then fell here with a fernando 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.680
 henrique cardoso in the country rose a lot 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.130
 with the real plan beyond what it could 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.440
 climb up fell down then climb up very strong 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.569
 now with squid much more than it should 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.030
 be giving back then the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.670
 capitalism is cyclical, it can not 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 be different only Chinese currency and that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.780
 controlled by the state that does not have these 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 and it is clear that it would be better not to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.100
 to have these cycles that we were like 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.739
 China, but Brazil has not made it to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.250
 hold the coin like china makes people 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.650
 you may notice then that although you have 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.019
 had this fall is that this decline was 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.940
 much larger than this then we 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.310
 we are only developing part of the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
 that we earn is in excess 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.730
 here I put that in scale 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 logarithmic one can notice that this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.510
 stay here 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.640
 it is much stronger than bringing 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.920
 a trend line for you to see 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.819
 that Brazil is in a strong trend 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.609
 High 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.620
 despite these ups and downs and now 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.540
 we are nothing more than 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.959
 practically over the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.730
 trend then 2011 was an exaggeration to 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.160
 That business from Brazil? 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.500
 world's darling or an exaggeration of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.140
 international market exaggeration in the list 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.400
 exaggeration of everybody including exaggeration 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.380
 My here is here 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480
 in fact I saw that it was exaggerated is 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.920
 just do not want personal slutty 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.810
 Believe that Brazil was okay. 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.180
 So now Brazil is not well or 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.370
 badly he is on average there the staff speaks 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.320
 that is in the back of the station, not even that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.170
 is only under inflation control 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.720
 is under control the real is if 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.579
 valuing ibovespa has recovered part of 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.250
 of stone gain 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.470
 then everything is under control then but the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.359
 What is missing for Brazil to grow more 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.010
 because Brazil does not grow in Brazil 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.200
 crash people because it's not a dictatorship 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.870
 like China that a democracy a 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.450
 responsible democracy is a democracy 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.359
 which encourages consumption so people 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.030
 Encouragement is the study of savings 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.950
 investment and never invest is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.470
 encourage consumption 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.710
 Consumption is a shot in the foot because 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.110
 you buy today 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.819
 Do you spend today enjoy today and you? 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.740
 compromises your future 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.080
 then Brazil to be able to grow more 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.370
 we should all be more austere 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.259
 We want to blame the government. 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 with the country but everyone just wants to know 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.039
 of spending to make day 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.560
 so if we were more austere as 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.870
 the Chinese and the Germans Brazil 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.759
 would grow even more if we voted 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.889
 in honest politicians would not have politician 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.090
 thief but we do everything wrong 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.139
 blame others 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.419
 so we have to pull the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.639
 responsibility for us and do the 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.639
 Brazil grow faster dove knows
