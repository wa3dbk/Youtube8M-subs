00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
about four cups so here's what I'm going

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
about four cups so here's what I'm going
to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> take<00:00:53.489> about<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:53.969> thirds<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to do to take about two thirds of it and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.010 
to do to take about two thirds of it and
put<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:56.550> vitamin<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.780> you'd<00:00:57.899> only

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
put it into my vitamin now if you'd only

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
put it into my vitamin now if you'd only
on<00:00:58.260> speed<00:00:58.770> blender<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> regular

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on speed blender I think a regular

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
on speed blender I think a regular
blender<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> fine<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
blender would be fine you can do this in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.020 
blender would be fine you can do this in
the<00:01:01.440> food<00:01:01.739> processor<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> little

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the food processor or just be a little

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.560 
the food processor or just be a little
bit<00:01:03.149> chunkier<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> let's<00:01:05.220> say<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.210> about
