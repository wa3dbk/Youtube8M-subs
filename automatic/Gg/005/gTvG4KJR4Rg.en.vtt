00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.430
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.320
 androidworld.it we are here to do a 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.180
 quick comparison between motorola moto ge 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.920
 show the motorcycle hicks are two products 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.009
 very very similar aesthetically but 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.300
 under the body in reality very different 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.730
 from where I show them on screen 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.279
 stuck and see how hard it is 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 really so much to distinguish them if there 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.039
 we vote 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.839
 here too the biggest difference is 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.300
 speaker that has been moved to the side but 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.329
 the motorola symbol also here sunken 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.960
 up here you see they are practically 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.149
 identical on the side here we have here 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.870
 the flap for symmetry instead 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.710
 on the bike and under the micro door body 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.780
 usb rocker switch power button 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.510
 volume now I might even have some 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.460
 difficulty finding out what the motogp is and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.089
 which motorcycle hicks ship is ok ok moto ge 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.150
 motorcycle hicks from the hardware point of view 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.570
 in more well-known hicks compared to moto g 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.950
 has up to 100 connectivity 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.820
 megabits per second 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.180
 the wifi abgn is present nfc 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 the processor becomes a dual core from 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.130
 1.7 giger teams nano 320 the rome 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.700
 doubles and becomes 2 gigabytes la 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.770
 basic memory doubles from 8 to 16 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.259
 gigabyte internal memory is present on 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 gyroscope the barometer on the motion hicks 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:37.479
 the camera is 10 megapixels against i 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.399
 5 of the motion one finally the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.680
 the most striking difference is certainly it 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.810
 screen passing from 4 inches and 5 to 4 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.329
 inches and 7 though the size 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.119
 remains the resolution sorry remains hd 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.820
 passes from a standard tft to an amoled 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.950
 of moto hicks 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 I'll show you more closely you see 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.550
 how the screen difference is 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.080
 quite important despite the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.070
 phone size is practically 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.170
 unchanged I set in both 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.050
 cases the brightness to the maximum so 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.680
 have no discrepancies and I'll show you 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 maybe I can start with the gallery 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 where up meanwhile on moggi is not present 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.980
 the gallery intended as an application that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.320
 it's called gallery but only 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.320
 the photo application of google plus 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.690
 see also how the colors are 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.280
 quite different even in the in 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.860
 color the whites definitely have one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.750
 different shade on the motorcycle hicks seem 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.340
 a little bit whiter in general 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.489
 colors are definitely brighter on 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.269
 matrix also see how much more blacks 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.890
 are the blacks of the motor hicks but anyway 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.780
 I remain I remain of the idea that they are 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.880
 the engines are two excellent screens 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.720
 obviously it shoots a little more because it is 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.040
 an amoled 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.440
 as for the applications 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.150
 we have motors motor assist that is 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.070
 present on both 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.549
 then we have the migration of motorola 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.890
 which is present on both though here 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.320
 now I don't see it if we go into the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.239
 settings 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 here we are obviously on the moto hicks in 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.049
 the more we have the active screen and the 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.549
 hands-free control 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.019
 as well as even the world 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.209
 word connect which is not present on the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.310
 moto g if we go to the info on 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.200
 phone let's see how android come 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 both cases updated version 4 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.890
 4 2 the kernel we see is later on 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.480
 on the motorcycle hicks 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.150
 in short, there are some differences 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.070
 but no major difference from the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.500
 point of view of the point of view 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.140
 software except for processors 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.890
 dedicated for example the one on motorcycles 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.269
 hicks that if i say ok now go now mi 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.290
 activate voice search what 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.820
 obviously it does not happen on the moto g 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.360
 therefore two devices as a whole 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.130
 very similar later 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.720
 view of software is not shown for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.710
 example the camera but the application 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.970
 it is that difficult to deliver one 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.370
 rather than the other the price 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.070
 obviously very different 199 to 399 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.480
 in their band, however, two products 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.490
 quite cheap gp bikes 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.810
 obviously even more convenient the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.500
 price difference turns into 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.420
 practically twice the price itself 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.280
 for this comparison between motion and motion 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.080
 hicks everything is a greeting from emanuele
