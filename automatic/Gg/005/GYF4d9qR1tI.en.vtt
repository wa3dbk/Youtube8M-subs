find the controls in UFC Unleashed to be
a<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:13.019> much<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.590> vastly<00:02:14.190> prefer<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.849> game

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
a little much I vastly prefer a game

in and play without the steep learning

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.970 
in and play without the steep learning
curve<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.330> conceptually<00:02:21.379> supremacy<00:02:22.379> MMA's

the<00:02:25.410> problem<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.220> how<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.610> concept<00:02:27.330> has<00:02:27.510> been

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the problem is how that concept has been

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.920 
the problem is how that concept has been
realized<00:02:28.400> if<00:02:29.400> you're<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.209> arcade

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
realized if you're going for that arcade

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.070 
realized if you're going for that arcade

like vibe fast and responsive action is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.350 
like vibe fast and responsive action is
