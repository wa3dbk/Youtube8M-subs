00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
not bad so there there it goes and now

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.540 
not bad so there there it goes and now
we're<00:02:02.180> going<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.440> turn<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.860> fix<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.190> for

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
we're going to turn it on and fix it for

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.730 
we're going to turn it on and fix it for
about<00:02:05.360> 30<00:02:05.780> seconds<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.350> sure<00:02:06.470> everything

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
about 30 seconds make sure everything

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740 
about 30 seconds make sure everything
gets<00:02:06.830> cooking<00:02:07.130> corporated<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:08.600> we're

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
gets cooking corporated so now we're

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.730 
gets cooking corporated so now we're
going<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.899> sift<00:02:09.110> all<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.410> our<00:02:09.530> dry<00:02:09.709> ingredients

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
going to sift all of our dry ingredients

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.320 
going to sift all of our dry ingredients
we're<00:02:10.340> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.520> start<00:02:10.700> off<00:02:10.759> with<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.030> flour

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
we're going to start off with the flour

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.420 
we're going to start off with the flour
we're<00:02:11.630> going<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> use<00:02:11.930> one<00:02:11.959> cup<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.250> way

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
we're going to use one cup and the way

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.460 
we're going to use one cup and the way
that<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.700> measure<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.450> cup<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.660> flour<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.290> by

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
that I measure one cup of flour is by

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.229 
that I measure one cup of flour is by
fluffing<00:02:15.950> up<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> flour<00:02:16.430> before<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.940> put<00:02:17.150> in

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
fluffing up the flour before I put in

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.090 
fluffing up the flour before I put in
the<00:02:17.360> code<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> make<00:02:18.650> sure<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:18.950> aren't

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the code just to make sure there aren't

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
the code just to make sure there aren't
any<00:02:19.250> clumps<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> fill<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.590> your<00:02:21.620> cup

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
any clumps and then you fill up your cup

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.470 
any clumps and then you fill up your cup
and<00:02:22.070> then<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.550> knife<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
and then you get a knife and you do the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.240 
and then you get a knife and you do the
same<00:02:23.630> thing<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.959> did<00:02:24.080> with<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.380> sugar<00:02:24.650> we're

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
same thing we did with the sugar we're

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.130 
same thing we did with the sugar we're
going<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> run<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.850> along<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> top<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.959> cup

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
going to run it along the top of the cup

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.620 
going to run it along the top of the cup
just<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.590> make<00:02:27.769> sure<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.070> we<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.850> exact

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
just to make sure that we have the exact

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.390 
just to make sure that we have the exact
measurement<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.650> that's<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:30.980> important

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
measurement because that's so important

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.890 
measurement because that's so important
when<00:02:31.519> you're<00:02:31.580> baking<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.510> we're<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.660> going

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.050 
when you're baking so we're just going
to<00:02:32.959> throw<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.380> into<00:02:33.590> our<00:02:33.830> Bowl<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:34.580> zipper

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.630 
to throw that into our Bowl with zipper
on<00:02:35.090> top<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:36.680> we're<00:02:36.799> going<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> get<00:02:37.100> half

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640
