this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> first<00:00:41.760> time<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.239> saw<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> tool

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this is the first time we saw this tool

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.170 
this is the first time we saw this tool
in<00:00:43.110> action<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> biggest<00:00:44.129> problem<00:00:44.610> was

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
in action and the biggest problem was

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
in action and the biggest problem was
cutting<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> existing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
cutting all the way through the existing

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
cutting all the way through the existing
material<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.360> didn't<00:00:48.629> notice<00:00:48.780> why<00:00:49.200> until

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
material but we didn't notice why until

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.790 
material but we didn't notice why until
the<00:00:50.070> film<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.520> being<00:00:50.820> edited<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:52.500> first

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the film was being edited the first

example<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> pretty<00:00:53.820> obvious<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.719> we

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
example is pretty obvious but not we

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
example is pretty obvious but not we
didn't<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.520> some<00:00:56.879> guys

didn't see it but you know some guys

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
didn't see it but you know some guys
that<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> crank<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.410> nifty<00:00:58.680> tool

that just want to crank that nifty tool

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
that just want to crank that nifty tool
up<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> let<00:00:59.699> her<00:00:59.820> rip<00:01:00.059> folks<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.260> needs<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> flat

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
up and let her rip folks it needs a flat

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
up and let her rip folks it needs a flat
surface<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> glide<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.019> second

surface to glide on and the second

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
surface to glide on and the second
example<00:01:04.769> shows<00:01:05.129> why<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> cut<00:01:05.760> wasn't<00:01:06.150> going

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
