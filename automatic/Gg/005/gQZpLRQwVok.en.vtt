community or homosexuals in general is
that<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> truth<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:31.980> God<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that there is a truth from God there is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760 
that there is a truth from God there is
a<00:00:32.820> standard<00:00:33.420> there<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.630> Elijah<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> Senate

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

Jesus said that he did not condemn her

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
Jesus said that he did not condemn her
but<00:00:46.050> his<00:00:46.200> words<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> her<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> sin<00:00:47.700> no

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
you're doing that for you because

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.039 
you're doing that for you because
perhaps<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.910> were<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.480> people<00:03:51.810> it

perhaps you were one of the people it
was<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.319> nurture<00:03:52.769> thing<00:03:52.980> not<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> nature<00:03:53.519> thing

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.220 

yeah<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:01.950> understand<00:04:02.669> that<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.599> don't<00:04:03.870> get

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
yeah I understand that and I don't get

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.170 
yeah I understand that and I don't get
into<00:04:04.410> nurture<00:04:04.739> nature<00:04:05.040> arguments<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.669> get<00:04:05.880> into

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
