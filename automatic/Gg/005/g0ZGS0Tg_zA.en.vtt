00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.170
 g will give 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.930
 Today 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.790
 demonstrated new technology 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.690
 polycarbonate protection 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.069
 developed by our company 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.279
 for this we need little 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.239
 several prototypes but 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:14.379
 plastic 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.169
 specimen dear inflicted special 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:17.960
 coating 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 and the price of landfill coating was applied 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 Now we will inflict the non-fans big 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.569
 number of paint exits 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.839
 in conditions 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.739
 Yu 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.170
 new leadership is one of the ways 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170
 small performance throw 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.810
 has smooth surface points 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.850
 According to the composition to react with 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.830
 all solvents that go into 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.680
 composition 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.270
 Not only 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.960
 able to strip the paint with a new composition 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.630
 paint itself 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.530
 which is used by vandals 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.350
 thereby employees 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 these company facilities 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770
 rendered practically hopeless 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.210
 provisions 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.320
 physical exposure brothers 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.700
 material does not lead 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.850
 horsetail surface 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 solvent exposure 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.570
 boxing or plastic 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.420
 removing paint composition in front of the driver us 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.050
 nuns 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.550
 very expensive and 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.110
 unproductive since cancer 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.990
 leaving color on plastic 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.730
 solvents and part 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.830
 paints 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.100
 service plans practically 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 powerless against whom such comforts 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.980
 here is our paint 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.290
 bit dried out on specimen number one and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.480
 apparently 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.090
 what surface 15 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.790
 since cocaine was bringing she was 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.860
 price 2 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.590
 image of saint patrick east 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 already says that he 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.490
 collapses 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.870
 field gorbal addition 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.100
 directly from solvent fires 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 who steal is he in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.410
 bologna tale 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 mug let's try 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.619
 given pollution 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.199
 but this technique 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 usually solvent 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.249
 first there in paris 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.939
 hard to choose 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.939
 bets 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.159
 I have a similar operation 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.669
 the stain has gone down the composition of polycarbonates 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.229
 and how we see what 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.229
 big st te spend big ruined 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.159
 directly 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.559
 cover surfaces 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.559
 sample 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.929
 the substance became soft 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 naturally 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.449
 and a good result 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.939
 let's try brethren 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.939
 paint first sample 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.219
 it is immediately visible that no impact 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.049
 eg 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.049
 Did not happen 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.430
 story 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.419
 ffu provence 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.309
 from the surface 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.650
 sample clear 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.650
 stayed 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.680
 rub directly 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.680
 maybe you 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.139
 police act 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.139
 politicians 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.870
 has come 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.849
 in absolute customs 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.680
 who was show what it really is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.379
 polycarbonate they 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.449
 usually silicate glass 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.059
 but upside down will affect 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:12.229
 unprocessed 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.779
 surface 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.939
 surfaces without residue just 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.499
 to understand correctly 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.499
 tampons solvent 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.489
 here we will see turbidity 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.489
 surface 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 of course with a note 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.919
 similar 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.110
 has undergone 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.460
 exactly the same impact 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.199
 surface bargain
