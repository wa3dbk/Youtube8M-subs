00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.039
 or 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.849
 go ahead save us is taken over for the little ones 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.930
 great sound tutorial today I you 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.420
 learn to make a quick stop that 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.640
 intrigue already a little harder I pulled 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.730
 a little bit harder than 3.6 fip and at 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 at the beginning it goes very badly we understand that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.070
 nothing to the strictest for art we're going 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 put his feet like that there so 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.710
 like that a little care right limit the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.239
 foot under the vices 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.640
 the back foot we'll put it in fact 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.640
 really at the beam 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.870
 we will put his foot like that after in 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.910
 it's a weird tricks 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.220
 because you must not miss it like a 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.930
 little clip like that we'll drape it to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.930
 scratch a little like that 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.270
 and with what she is we will push a 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.670
 little like that for first of all to go she 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.220
 do what there is also it is that it is 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.040
 not really finally this is a pop a 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.750
 little weird in fact it's before we do 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.660
 his entry he must 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.680
 be well pressed on the edge a 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.680
 tiny of course before 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100
 concentrates that 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.200
 not at all 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.830
 where semih it's a little bit long to 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.240
 learn 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.210
 at the beginning the plates and all the time a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.640
 foot any simple field but after that is 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.049
 a tricks quai joly to go back so that's it 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.049
