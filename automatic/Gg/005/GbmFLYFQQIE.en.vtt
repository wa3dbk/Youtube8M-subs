00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.740 
and there it is see that it's not in
full-hd<00:04:03.710> because<00:04:04.430> obviously<00:04:04.640> Netflix<00:04:05.480> does

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
full-hd because obviously Netflix does

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.740 
full-hd because obviously Netflix does
not<00:04:05.900> stream<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.410> HD<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.240> keep<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.390> in<00:04:08.450> mind

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
not stream in HD so keep that in mind

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.740 
not stream in HD so keep that in mind
it's<00:04:09.050> not<00:04:09.110> going<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.410> show<00:04:09.680> at<00:04:10.060> 1080<00:04:11.060> p<00:04:11.240> or<00:04:11.270> 720

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
it's not going to show at 1080 p or 720

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.420 
it's not going to show at 1080 p or 720
resolution<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:13.550> is<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.760> little<00:04:14.180> bit<00:04:14.360> blurry

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
resolution it is a little bit blurry

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.860 
resolution it is a little bit blurry
because<00:04:16.430> basically<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.269> screen<00:04:17.660> on<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
because basically the screen on the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.020 
because basically the screen on the
Kindle<00:04:18.350> is<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.620> better<00:04:19.459> resolution<00:04:19.640> so<00:04:19.940> it

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
Kindle is a better resolution so it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.729 
Kindle is a better resolution so it
looks<00:04:20.209> better<00:04:20.480> on<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.810> Kindle<00:04:21.170> but<00:04:21.320> still

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
looks better on the Kindle but still

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.270 
looks better on the Kindle but still
Netflix<00:04:22.700> doesn't<00:04:22.880> output<00:04:23.530> 1080p<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.010> keep

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
Netflix doesn't output 1080p so keep

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.310 
Netflix doesn't output 1080p so keep
that<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.460> mind<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.030> all<00:04:26.660> your<00:04:26.690> other<00:04:26.900> apps<00:04:27.170> you
