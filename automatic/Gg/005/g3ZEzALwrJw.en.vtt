00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.920

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.630

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.429
 fashion favorites this is one of the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.849
 things I like most about 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.060
 Youtube 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.820
 and as I moved and do not like 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 too much this place so to film for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 filming I finally found a way to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.269
 make a favorite fashion video in this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 space with good immunity with the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.660
 good place with a morgue and that's 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 true it's youtube problems 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.030
 I made a favorite fashion video 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.969
 special office working in son macha 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 in short, I feel a little broken my head 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.329
 for a while I tried 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 a lot of things and then finally I think 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.840
 to have found my style and I think that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.489
 in a fashion favors a little I can 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 to share with you it can help a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 one or the other and it can be very 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.190
 present letter if you spend an internship 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.230
 happened an interview in the left 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 if you start working too or 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.820
 if you are already working and you have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.359
 want to change a bit of thinking 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 a little things 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.989
 short if you are interested in this 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 video if you want to see how 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 I get dressed for the office for a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 more professional way 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 I invite you to watch this video and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 this is my first outfit it's a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 black outfits as I like 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.180
 but I wanted and incorporate a shirt 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.439
 and there are different types of shirts are 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.759
 full full of types of shirts 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.890
 in fact finally with reasons 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.330
 overreacting with a state s in details and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.009
 right now I do not really know what 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 I like and I love the weights and I have 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.520
 found this shirt always in the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 same sting shop like where I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 purchased this t-shirt this polk shirt 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 endows with polka dots and blacks is very 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.540
 fluid too so I like a lot of the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.670
 material 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.010
 '' my topic I thought it could 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.270
 pass to work buttoned 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.200
 to the top and I like it I read 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.330
 parcel to accessorize the thing and a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.760
 simple black pants and ankle boots 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.350
 remains basic black but you have the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 polkas detail two reassembled the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.760
 shirt up with a nice package 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.010
 for the bi and more I think it 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.410
 goes very well and that's my first 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.320
 holding second holding can not pass 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.840
 next door is the little black dress 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.209
 and there I finally found one for the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.800
 office is the two plates 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.180
 I find that Prague sometimes makes 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.340
 things where we do not really have 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 the impression that it comes from prague and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.100
 this rom is part of this kind of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.830
 things so the material is very fluid 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.680
 like for the shirt and I like them 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.480
 crossover facts actually enlist a pretty 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.030
 discounted but you can also put to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.340
 a t-shirt or that she will do anything for 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.080
 avoid the eagle at the cleavage and and the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.400
 bottom is also dug so she is not 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.230
 too short either 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.080
 and as it is still a little france 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.750
 moment I bought a ton of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.640
 cardigans I put cardigans a little to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.220
 all the sauces because I find 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.470
 that it's a bit of a bit intellectual 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.900
 biliothÃ¨que hours that I like a lot 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 and I bought a lot to dress 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.980
 finally but my clothes and I 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.989
 wins especially for the little dress 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 black with a nice pair of ballerinas 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.010
 it's very cute good quality too 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.799
 so I think it's nice for the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.209
 office from time to time my third 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.519
 holding breaks a little codes it's 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.890
 really when we imagine ourselves holding 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.200
 for the office we imagine the costume 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.970
 the shirt and a nice pair of 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.769
 shoes and ben me I have a little 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.700
 revisited the thing adore wear wearing 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.030
 jeans and I like or semi a jegging and a 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.720
 simple sweater actually from mungo who 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 is this one so a simple sweater with the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.420
 the collar in navy blue and also the sleeve 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.980
 in navy blue so a little detail without 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.170
 afraid because it finally coordinates 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.200
 with my blazer from zara 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.520
 I like it a lot and I have a lot of pain 1 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560
 for some time so the 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.270
 blazers are of very good quality which 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.180
 long enough according to me 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.160
 short I chose I choose the color 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.190
 navy blue to just wear this 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.140
 kind of blazer or that kind of pub with 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.209
 jeans because it's going to be a reminder 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.830
 of color and finally it's not too much 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.340
 shocking with that I put a beautiful 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.260
 pair of heels that dates lie down 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.880
 a little legs and that gives a side 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.410
 a little bit more elegant 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.640
 so I did not think of putting it with 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.979
 ballerinas that would be too casual 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.359
 finally so with talents that that 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.639
 lets you finally forget that 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.669
 wearing jeans with a sweater and a blazer 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.990
 it's very very glamorous business very 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.680
 finally also I find 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.700
 and I like his outfit finally too 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.580
 fourth and last outfit this is one of 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.940
 my favorite outfits is really 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.770
 this dress comes from the boudin 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.710
 twitter and I really like it's a 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.200
 sleeveless dress just like that very 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.180
 very very simple as it is a dress 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.250
 very simple we can well accessories and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.810
 you can put all the sauces months 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.510
 for the game office but just a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.880
 beautiful belt and I get a cardigan 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.680
 as I showed you my games sometimes 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.010
 I put it simply if a big vest 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.720
 all cozy I love this one I ' 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.940
 have seen the millennium emerge 2 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.980
 the channel so on youtube she had 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.270
 bought at pramac I found that 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.270
 I bought it right away because I 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.950
 thought it was too pretty too cozy and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.660
 I love wearing it in the office when 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.810
 it's cold 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.570
 and here is my outfit so I found that 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.100
 very cool but it's a little loose in 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.620
 does its features months actually it's very 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.780
 I love clothes where we are 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.670
 in in this direction well and I'm 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.010
 exactly in that state when I 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.620
 wear this dress I put proofs and 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.750
 this vest with a pair of boots that 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.820
 I love who are and says they will be 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.850
 very rock and they simply 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.240
 beautiful and that's it I finished with my 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.310
 favorite fashion special office or work in 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.380
