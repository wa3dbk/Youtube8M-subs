00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:07.370
 guys, we're going to film the looping of the 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:11.210
 I'll be right here now and that 's a 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.450
 very crazy thing and we stay 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.340
 remembering the time assist speed racer a 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.150
 Acrobatic team these things there 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.650
 Alpine gone and now after so 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.699
 Time we'll see the guys do it. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.420
 This is not going to come. 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.289
 first 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.289
 I did not watch 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.380
 It's not for school guys, he said he 's a magician. 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 ae 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.140
 an expectation that in the IMF 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 a looping 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.010
 but then good between 70 per hour the galley 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.820
 already physical does the rest is logical have to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.820
 get in right right 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.210
 already the word of the pilot who does the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.210
 stuff usually works out okay 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.990
 aac 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 haha ha 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.400
 was from that was the end of the concrete path 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 galley abrasu
