00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone here I am from 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.200
 back today with another video 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.830
 we will say that I am productive enough 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.210
 lately I'm laughing 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 so the video of the day is simply 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.340
 sos skin that pulls so it's winter the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 temperatures drop and the period 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.539
 that we hate the most because it makes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.039
 too cold to get covered with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 tons the two tons and thann and of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.930
 tons of clothes before going out of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.119
 at home 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 so obviously we are a little bad at the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 skin one has the skin that pulls so if in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 the more we live in the Paris region with 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.140
 the water which is extremely calcareous we have 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 extremely bad so has my little ones 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.170
 tips a month to avoid having the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 skin that pulls it's just me 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.200
 scratch the skin to the maximum so according to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 that you are rather a fan of products 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 natural or rather a fan of products 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.230
 found directly in the trade 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 There are two ways to moisturize the skin 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 so at the exit of your shower you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 apply your cream month creams 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 who will help me to spend this winter are 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.949
 these two take so so the first 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.320
 I'm going to talk about this one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.710
 it's the little Marseille is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.479
 repairer to spoil and parched 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.020
 none were with aloe and wax 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.970
 bee 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.380
 so why am I using this one is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 more young because I think that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 it was thin and yellow that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.750
 I had spoken in my previous video 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 on my favorite moisturizer it's 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 simply because the little 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 Marseille young stockings with the smell 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.799
 begin to remember that I do not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 support I can not stand this smell anymore 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.700
 so this one I like because 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 the smell is much softer 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:37.409
 so here morning story by apply 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 on the whole of your body here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.579
 so it can scratch the skin and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.820
 so to see it a little more malleable and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.549
 that she pulls a little less so 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 generally even though I missed the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.869
 skin in the morning in the late afternoon 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 especially when I wore tights 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.439
 I have the skin that pulls the call anyway 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.549
 I am extremely hurt 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.270
 the impression that tom the problem is in 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.369
 cotton or with holes 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 I do not know that he absorbs all this 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.579
 hydration using your skin and you 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.420
 have more and more harm to the skin more 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.590
 the day ahead is so in the evening what 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 that I generally apply for 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.709
 so relieve my legs it's this one 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.660
 it is therefore the cream sittomat centea 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.250
 soothing dermatological cream and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.569
 restorative then I want to show to what 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.900
 point I love this product the tube is 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.610
 practically empty avoids me from home fast 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.819
 this cream cij the discoveries thanks to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.989
 joel through corn leaves there already 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.940
 a little over a year is she who 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.880
 had passed me my first tube and since 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.440
 I give it so in the evening that's what 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.920
 I apply on my legs generally 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.560
 to soothe them moisturize and c 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.500
 is this cream she's just perfect 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 and use morning finally morning evening and 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.590
 it's the fact that youtube is not very 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.420
 great you can walk with 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.400
 in your purse and if you ever 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.410
 need during the day of 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.290
 ironing a layer of cream will you 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.000
 give back you can use it and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.359
 abuse 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.340
 so if you are rather fans of 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.799
 natural products that you are not from 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.569
 any fan train you are not oriented 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.090
 products found in the big business 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.030
 the best yet are the beurs so 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.400
 afraid of shea their demand or the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 oils so 8 fine 12 argan oil 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.600
 coconut oil olive oil is like 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.340
 you want the best is to achieve 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.980
 for example a nice shea or a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.980
 quarter and whipped as we will call it 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.599
 I already made a video about it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.150
 you can watch it because they were 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.290
 gold whipped guys were improved 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.730
 we're going to say that like that so it's 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.829
 just a shea butter that you 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.240
 mix with your favorite and so 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.910
 the same apply to the skin 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.070
 in full for late after after your 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.080
 shower every time that allows you the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.790
 made of mass and the skin already helps 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.920
 keep the elasticity of this behind 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.750
 but applying cream 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.150
 it's not bad with the hair that you 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.100
 moisturizes your skin and therefore 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.470
 feed her to fix it etc 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.260
 so that will prevent you from having the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.670
 skin that pulls so it will prevent that the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.230
 limestone make you skin 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.960
 completely white when you are black 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.180
 and do not apply cream and 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.100
 cold outside it's not pretty to see 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.620
 I tell you all that right now it's 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.720
 not pretty to see the country and its products 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.540
 moisturizers are valid for absolutely 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.370
 everyone not only far away 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.680
 but also the white ones the green ones the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 oranges the violets I do not know I'm 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.640
 am wrong to know what color of 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.560
 skin you are if you have skin that 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.740
 it must be moisturized and hydrated 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.420
 it's after you've got it that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.610
 you applied water on your 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.530
 body you apply a cream 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.410
 so be a cream of the big business 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.510
 be a cream a homemade cream a 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.280
 shea butter or him so that's it 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.980
 so it was for the top 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.910
 of the body in general we will talk about 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.890
 lips also winter hurts our 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.330
 lips they are usually gays and 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.180
 so the dead skin this trip two 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.920
 times more and it's the best scrub 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.860
 in the world for the lips it's 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.889
 simply 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.569
 cane sugar and a few minutes you 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.909
 mix both and you apply to 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.069
 using your finger rubbing well 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.169
 your lips for to remove the skins 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.449
 hand and you are finally you have 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.539
 the sweet student after but for 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.560
 maintain a relationship in the day 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.139
 here are two small products that I have 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.539
 discovered late that I bought there is little 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.550
 so that's the new baby lips of 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.409
 maybelline then at the base I was a 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.319
 big fan of the bike but I do not know 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.539
 not if it's usual where these covers 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.400
 and I do not know what but there melo does not 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.360
 will empty more to his students each time 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.550
 that I apply my bike I have 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.750
 the impression of not having applied anything 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.279
 without limits after I have again 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.550
 dry lips etc 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:56.500
 so I cut the ringtone world is 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.659
 come because it's my knowledge me that 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.550
 will ring for a long time 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.520
 So suddenly I dropped the case 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.529
 there bike and I had a little trouble at 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.000
 find lip balms that me 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:12.699
 gave this side I leave world he misses 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.319
 years alice et cetera and let him 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.610
 maintained for an hour 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.310
 or two or a little more 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.169
 so I am very happy with babies 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.830
 lips I write that two I have them 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.650
 bought at monoprix I took only 2 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.759
 blue so this one that is 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.770
 transparent like that so it's a label 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:35.710
 to the simple but with an unfortunate ward 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.319
 hydration and the rose which is so 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.029
 big like that is not bad 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.870
 hydration side and which in addition you 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.229
 bring color 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.719
 so if you are very dark 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:50.110
 this one you may want to want the 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:51.430
 marry with a lip pencil for good 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.810
 work the color otherwise they say 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.550
 to be a little too pink because 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.650
 it's really a rose a barbie rose 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.289
 So that's my two companions 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.749
 who will get everything 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.349
 all winter so these are the baby of 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:03.409

 I will go get their 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:08.639

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.930

 the senses I know it's going a lot 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.099
 much less clear so here 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.229
