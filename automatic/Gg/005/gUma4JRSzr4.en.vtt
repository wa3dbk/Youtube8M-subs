00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
I have a bunch of high-heeled shoes I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.970 
I have a bunch of high-heeled shoes I
can't<00:04:14.719> really<00:04:14.870> wear<00:04:15.019> because<00:04:15.379> I<00:04:15.500> can't<00:04:15.859> walk

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.699 
can't really wear because I can't walk
in<00:04:16.130> high<00:04:16.190> heels<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.669> yeah

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
in high heels so yeah

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.199 
in high heels so yeah
somewhere<00:04:18.709> between<00:04:18.859> 1,500<00:04:19.579> pairs<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:19.970> guess

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
somewhere between 1,500 pairs I guess

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.540 
somewhere between 1,500 pairs I guess
when<00:04:21.109> was<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.380> first<00:04:21.410> time<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:22.039> wore<00:04:22.250> heels
