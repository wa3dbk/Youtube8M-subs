00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 that diet to get into the bikini 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.050

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.730
 celso diet in a steak house because 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.940
 This is the novelty of this year for those who 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 You need to make peace with the balance. 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.580
 compact now is no longer a thing 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 from past 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 the researchers found that there is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 other things to worry about 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 our Christian reporter gomes was 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.880
 discover what changes these are 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.890
 and if they have even resulted the pants is 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 symbol of the time when gabriela was 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.700
 obese 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.059
 this is that everything was just a girl 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 pretty but weighed almost 120 pounds 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 many diets were always with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.140
 strong 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.410
 after so many failed attempts 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 I thought it has to be a magic to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 make it work 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 gabriela has lost almost 30 pounds in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.579
 four months when he began to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.190
 Glycemic Index Diet This picture of you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.729
 Kids know by shopping to choose 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 justifies great imagine leaving is more 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.320
 old cacoal bakhtin happen by 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 glycemic index is the amount of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.460
 glucose going into the blood 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 after ingestion of a food the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.659
 researchers found that food 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.409
 with low glycemic index help 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.970
 to slim down those with a reputation for 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.979
 fattening then there are drugs that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.600
 Most people know Glycemic Prince 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.520
 borges and has a rice and beans 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 corn you have the beacon 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 That's how Gabriela lost weight. 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 doctor explains that at the beginning the diet is 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 different 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 no vegetables or physical exercise 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.570
 meat can eat at will 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.280
 looking at the funny thing about the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 land programming to be that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.430
 person will do is I forbid exercise 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 exercise during the ten days of diet that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.790
 had a drug case and would have it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 stay the whole day at a steakhouse 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.909
 eating meat there was cheese 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.920
 looking on this side seems 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 extremely ludic wonders is remedy 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.590
 can even bacon salami 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.870
 raw ham this is another discovery to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 quantity of calories from a food already 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.069
 not the most important 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.319
 This is a meeting of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.720
 organization that many years ago 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.900
 helps people lose weight and here 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 diet has always been synonymous with counting 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.360
 calories but now even the vigilantes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 are on the alert because they consider this 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.380
 outdated rule 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.180
 on the basis of this novelty, the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.420
 already made changes to the programs 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.280
 in 30 countries where changes take place 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.190
 have not yet arrived at the units 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.700
 brazil this endocrinologist strengthens 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.849
 these diets with low glycemic index 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.459
 they produced a greater weight loss 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.110
 these people lost another kilo of 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.780
 than other dieters 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.480
 Normal but you take care of 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.569
 I prefer to take exams before 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.400
 see cholesterol and insulin the glucose 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.790
 uric acid before making any 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.459
 diet he sees in a magazine in a 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 a pizza with the children for whom 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.500
 lived the drama of obesity 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.049
 Gabriela says relearn how to eat and 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.299
 you can relax yourself from time to time. 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.440
 when a very happy laid back 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.440
 I find I like it a lot
