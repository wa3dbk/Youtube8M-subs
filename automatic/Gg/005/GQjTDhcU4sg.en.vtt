00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello there came another package with 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.440
 The aliexpress in this package must be 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.200
 These are mechanical watches, they are able to 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.180
 show time date on the day of the week and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:22.039
 a month at the time of order they cost 39 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.420
 dollars 60 cents so they 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.300
 look on the site in pictures 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.500
 let's see what they are 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.010
 present in reality the clock came 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.320
 But in such a small box in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:47.890
 no visible damage 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.890
 no so let's try to open 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.390
 3 seems to be another box 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.239
 Winner skeleton which is 500 rubles each 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.709
 ordered they came without any 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:15.999
 extra boxes just in 

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:22.719
 conventional packaging is lonely more expensive and 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:22.719
 packaging is more expensive here it is packaging 

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:28.270
 ordinary cardboard box let's 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:37.939
 look even inside 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:41.959
 red pad and watch yet 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.590
 additionally sealed bumpy 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.590
 film 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.710
 so here they are watch themselves 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.460
 In principle, everything looks very much like a clock 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.250
 for some reason probably 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.540
 self-winding is which during 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 transport spun 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:23.330
 pendulum pretty good working buttons 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:31.380
 here you see switches in my 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:37.310
 month this button switches apparently 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:45.140
 Date 7 8 9 10 and this button probably 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.140
 days of the week are switching all that way 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.640
 some kind of strange sound do not listen 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 know what that means 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.650
 maybe it should be so 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 let's try to translate the time 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.930
 also translated without problems 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.959
 in general, the watch looks very good 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.519
 it is immediately clear that they are still not 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.840
 200 300 rubles 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:27.530
 a little more expensive on the arrows i see that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.290
 there is a coating such phosphorus let's 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.609
 let's try to see how it works under 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.549
 our slats are really very 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:45.639
 not bad glows so bracelet bracelet y 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:51.139
 us standard chinese metal 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:54.280
 the lock is also standard in general these 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.810
 the clock was ordered by a friend for his brother 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.930
 wants to give him either a day 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.769
 the birth of either this holiday 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.629
 I hope that my brother will like this watch 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.519
 honestly the case of this watch to me 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.409
 very familiar 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.919
 since just recently I was doing a crash test 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.810
 similar Chinese watches are the only thing 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.530
 There these buttons did not work, they were 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.159
 fake 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.949
 This button was not there at all. 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:32.690
 the clock showed only time without any 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:35.479
 dates are not a week and so forth on this all 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 principle, the clock is very good not 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.169
 I know whether they are worth 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.330
 one and a half thousand or not worth the pendulum 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.070
 dangles very well i'm looking i'm not yet 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.020
 I havenâ€™t seen anything like that in skill tons 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.860
 Well, in general, that's all if you liked it 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.780
 Like if dislike 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.409
 if you want to see the crash test 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.490
 like hours click here on this 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.490
 all happy
