mid foot of the shoe for a little bit of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.319 
mid foot of the shoe for a little bit of
control<00:01:33.869> we've<00:01:34.290> added<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.829> drb<00:01:35.340> excel<00:01:35.790> which

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
control we've added the drb excel which

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
control we've added the drb excel which
keeps<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> shoe<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.290> twisting<00:01:37.770> torsionally

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
keeps the shoe from twisting torsionally

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
keeps the shoe from twisting torsionally
so<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> gives<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.270> teeny<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> support<00:01:40.049> even

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so it gives a teeny bit of support even
