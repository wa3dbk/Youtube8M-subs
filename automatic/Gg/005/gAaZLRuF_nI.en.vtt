00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.220
 Hi, I'm Lorenzo, responsible for 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040
 interior design for Spain and today 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.410
 we are in a great garden and you 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.570
 we invite you to celebrate a moment a 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.230
 very special event and we are going to do it 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.050
 with the architect and wedding macarena 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.119
 planner for the karim boyfriends that Swedish 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.760
 and we have thought of a Spanish 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.160
 Intimate celebration fresh and with a touch 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.650
 folk there are three main foreigners 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.140
 that articulate the wedding and that will be the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.820
 Outdoor food a relaxing area and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.540
 a corner of activities for the most 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.490
 little ones 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.250
 we are in the first scenario of 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.370
 our wedding that is this food area 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.990
 At first we thought about the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.610
 scheme in the distribution that better 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.500
 they went for our number of guests and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.270
 for the space that we had and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.790
 finally we opted for a 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.650
 distribution in whose seats they combine 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.660
 different types of chair and also 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.360
 banks in the in the inner zone of the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.220
 uv to pay tribute to the roots 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.900
 of karim we have based on a range 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.570
 chromatic that connects with 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.450
 traditions and with Swedish folklore and in 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.210
 which we can find earth tones the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.509
 red typical of the Swedish house and also 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.040
 blacks like the forge etcetera one of the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.560
 first elements that we choose for the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.020
 decoration of the tables was this jara 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.430
 so we found it very affordable already 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.050
 The time has served as thread 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.450
 driver for other areas of the wedding 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.369
 as tableware consulted by this 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
 combination of dishes and bowls of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.390
 different collections and different 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.310
 colors mounted on is bald tablecloth 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.500
 of natural fibers that limits the space 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.729
 of each guest as an original idea for 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.130
 lay our guests 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.960
 we have opted for this solution so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 simple as a wooden spoon 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.380
 we have written the name of each guest 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.979
 and that we have posed on the rag of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.570
 kitchen and that gives us a set of 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.280
 very special table service and at the same time 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 very functional 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.590
 all right 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.390
 we are in the second scenario that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.300
 we have designed for the wedding of karim and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.580
 pablo that is this relaxation area in the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.800
 that the guests can come after 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
 from the food to take a sweet a drink 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.640
 as important elements of you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 that nobody could highlight the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 carpets that help us exhaust the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.730
 space and we can use now for 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.190
 which is very well priced and can be 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 overlap each other and even the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 We can combine with type rugs 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.590
 perch can be seen like the ones we have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
 everyone at home and we can take them out 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.500
 garden and create a combined effect so 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.790
 interesting as this one would finally have 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.709
 to highlight a very important part 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.230
 of the official that would be enlightenment 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.810
 this scenario when night falls 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.940
 to collect a new life from the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 lanterns the candles that we can find 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 in and that you have to simply place and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.720
 a tray can give a very 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.060
 interesting and of course the lights and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.430
 Libyan sticks will also help us 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 get this magical atmosphere last 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.110
 that will transform this space and that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.910
 They will give a special charm and will surprise you 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.860
 to all our guests 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.840
 We do not forget the smallest of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.640
 the wave and for this we have designed a 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.040
 space full of creativity and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.960
 activities joining several trees of the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.090
 garden with a rope and covering it with 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.240
 mosquito nets we get a space 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.010
 cozy and full of magic 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.440
 As activities we have chosen 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.510
 crafts with colored boxes and papers 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 that can become a fun 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.690
 present
