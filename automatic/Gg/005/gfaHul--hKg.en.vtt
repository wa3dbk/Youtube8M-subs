00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.749 
really taking those cookies and those
bars<00:01:45.560> mixing<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.770> seeds<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> sprouted

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
bars mixing it with seeds the sprouted

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.660 
bars mixing it with seeds the sprouted
seeds<00:01:47.970> nuts<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> much<00:01:49.680> healthier<00:01:49.950> treat<00:01:50.490> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
seeds nuts so a much healthier treat but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
seeds nuts so a much healthier treat but
still<00:01:50.939> considered<00:01:51.329> recreational<00:01:51.960> raw<00:01:52.110> next

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
still considered recreational raw next

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
still considered recreational raw next
up<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.100> sensible<00:01:53.549> rot<00:01:53.820> now<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.299> still

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
up we have sensible rot now it's still

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.510 
up we have sensible rot now it's still
gonna<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.720> healthy<00:01:55.170> foods<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.860> our<00:01:56.100> stomach

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
gonna be healthy foods but our stomach

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
gonna be healthy foods but our stomach
only<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> ability<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> break<00:01:57.689> down<00:01:57.750> foods

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
only has the ability to break down foods

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.520 
only has the ability to break down foods
like<00:01:58.469> vegetables<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:59.250> fruits<00:01:59.729> independent

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
like vegetables or fruits independent

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.289 
like vegetables or fruits independent
so<00:02:01.159> when<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.400> start<00:02:01.610> pairing<00:02:01.970> them<00:02:02.090> together

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
so when we start pairing them together

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.200 
so when we start pairing them together
in<00:02:02.720> solids<00:02:03.260> maybe<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.460> haven't<00:02:04.640> been<00:02:04.850> paired

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
in solids maybe they haven't been paired

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.870 
in solids maybe they haven't been paired
ideally<00:02:06.080> but<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:06.680> still<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.190> sensible<00:02:07.729> meal

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
ideally but it's still a sensible meal

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.600 
ideally but it's still a sensible meal
so<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.420> might<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> salad<00:02:09.619> or<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.890> juice<00:02:10.340> or

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so you might have a salad or a juice or

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.850 
so you might have a salad or a juice or
a<00:02:10.670> smoothie<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.390> has<00:02:11.600> been<00:02:11.860> improperly

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
a smoothie that has been improperly

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.059 
a smoothie that has been improperly
combined<00:02:13.400> still<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.450> sensible<00:02:14.990> raw<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.890> not

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
combined still it's sensible raw but not

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.220 
combined still it's sensible raw but not
optimal<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.540> move<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.080> next

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
optimal then we move up to the next

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.290 
optimal then we move up to the next
level<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.739> raw<00:02:18.890> which<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.340> superior<00:02:19.670> raw<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
level of raw which is superior raw and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.820 
level of raw which is superior raw and
these<00:02:20.630> are<00:02:20.750> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:20.989> your<00:02:21.080> dark<00:02:21.440> leafy

equal<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.720> measure

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
equal but we can now measure
