haven't put any limitations on him since

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.760 
haven't put any limitations on him since
that<00:04:25.370> point<00:04:25.610> nor<00:04:26.360> do<00:04:26.450> we<00:04:26.480> expect<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.440> going

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that point nor do we expect to going

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.640 
that point nor do we expect to going
forward<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.310> he's<00:04:28.880> close<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.630> 210<00:04:30.229> pounds

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
forward so he's close to 210 pounds

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.409 
forward so he's close to 210 pounds
which<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.890> about<00:04:31.130> maxed<00:04:31.700> out<00:04:31.820> for<00:04:32.030> his<00:04:32.150> frame

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
which is about maxed out for his frame

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.360 
which is about maxed out for his frame
he's<00:04:33.320> worked<00:04:33.530> extremely<00:04:33.800> hard<00:04:34.010> in<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
he's worked extremely hard in the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.560 
he's worked extremely hard in the
offseason<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.790> get<00:04:34.880> himself<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.360> point

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
offseason to get himself to this point

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.480 
offseason to get himself to this point
so<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.199> feel<00:04:36.680> better<00:04:36.830> about<00:04:36.949> Jordan<00:04:37.340> right

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
