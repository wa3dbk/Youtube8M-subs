00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
with lasers it's nothing against a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.670 
with lasers it's nothing against a
floaty<00:03:43.120> character<00:03:43.599> it's<00:03:43.750> very<00:03:44.049> much<00:03:44.260> battle

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680

people to dreamland I like dreamland a
lot<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.299> think<00:03:58.510> it's<00:03:58.629> really<00:03:58.810> good<00:03:58.930> Falco<00:03:59.349> to

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
lot I think it's really good Falco to

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.559 
lot I think it's really good Falco to
you<00:03:59.590> so<00:03:59.829> yeah<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.549> like<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:01.120> just<00:04:01.419> don't

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
you so yeah so I like it I just don't

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.939 
you so yeah so I like it I just don't
think<00:04:01.750> it's<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.349> be-all<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.680> end-all

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
think it's like the be-all and end-all

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.399 
think it's like the be-all and end-all
now<00:04:03.430> first<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.120> every<00:04:04.419> time<00:04:04.569> against<00:04:04.989> them<00:04:05.109> it

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
now first and every time against them it

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.960 
now first and every time against them it
depends<00:04:05.769> on<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:05.889> character<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:06.699> depends

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
depends on the character and it depends

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.000 
depends on the character and it depends
on<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> player<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.389> how<00:04:07.750> they<00:04:07.900> play<00:04:08.109> I<00:04:08.349> think

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
on the player and how they play I think

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.670 
on the player and how they play I think
when<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.549> comes<00:04:09.729> to<00:04:09.879> age<00:04:10.000> pics<00:04:10.269> um<00:04:10.510> i<00:04:11.139> think<00:04:11.349> for

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
when it comes to age pics um i think for

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.129 
when it comes to age pics um i think for
a<00:04:12.340> lot<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:12.639> characters<00:04:13.150> especially<00:04:13.299> fox<00:04:13.870> who

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
a lot of characters especially fox who

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.649 
a lot of characters especially fox who
doesn't<00:04:14.500> really<00:04:14.799> have<00:04:15.099> a<00:04:15.370> terrible<00:04:15.760> stage<00:04:16.120> it

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
doesn't really have a terrible stage it

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.240 
doesn't really have a terrible stage it
all<00:04:16.780> depends<00:04:17.139> on<00:04:17.169> use<00:04:17.409> person<00:04:17.919> your<00:04:18.039> play

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
all depends on use person your play

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.029 
all depends on use person your play
style<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.079> size<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.409> the<00:04:20.470> stage<00:04:20.680> could

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
style so the size of the stage could

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.770 
style so the size of the stage could
depend<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:21.549> just<00:04:21.820> how<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.030> play<00:04:22.570> that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
depend on just how you play that

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.710 
depend on just how you play that
character<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.710> don't<00:04:24.280> rely<00:04:24.460> on<00:04:24.849> it<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.389> too

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
character so don't rely on it to too

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.130 
character so don't rely on it to too
much<00:04:26.130> focus
