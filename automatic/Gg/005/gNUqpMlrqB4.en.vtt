00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
it down but it just wasn't convenient

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.280 
it down but it just wasn't convenient
for<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.600> space<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> had

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

or your b and eight players on the map

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.449 
or your b and eight players on the map
so<00:03:30.690> maybe<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.380> v4<00:03:31.590> i'm<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.160> really<00:03:32.340> sure

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
so maybe not for v4 i'm not really sure

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.600 
so maybe not for v4 i'm not really sure
about<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.940> we'll<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.840> wait<00:03:33.989> until

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
about it we'll just have to wait until

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.150 
about it we'll just have to wait until
black<00:03:35.610> ops<00:03:35.820> comes<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.680> but<00:03:37.680> it'd<00:03:37.950> be

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
black ops comes out for that but it'd be

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.000

it's supposed to be those characters as
well<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:40.200> that'd<00:04:40.350> be<00:04:40.470> cool<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:41.010> pans<00:04:41.250> out

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
well so that'd be cool that pans out

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.300 
well so that'd be cool that pans out
because<00:04:41.760> then<00:04:41.940> call<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.720> dead<00:04:43.080> how<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:44.360> send
