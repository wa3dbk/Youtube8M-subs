as<00:01:27.529> director<00:01:27.979> i<00:01:28.009> think<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.369> Wachowski<00:01:28.909> has<00:01:29.359> a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
as director i think the Wachowski has a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.050 
as director i think the Wachowski has a
great<00:01:30.380> vision<00:01:30.829> towards<00:01:31.159> anything<00:01:31.609> so<00:01:31.909> i<00:01:31.939> think

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
great vision towards anything so i think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.910 
great vision towards anything so i think
she<00:01:32.329> could<00:01:32.479> do<00:01:32.569> a<00:01:32.599> good<00:01:32.779> job<00:01:32.840> but<00:01:33.679> what<00:01:33.859> are
