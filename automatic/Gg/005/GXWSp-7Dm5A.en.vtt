00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.700
 was my football figure is bringing 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.980
 here for you another envelope to 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 that the panini has launched in other 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.820
 countries 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.240
 It's how you see it here. It's a 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.279
 purple kind of a little bold but it's more 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 Go there purple 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.400
 It's okay, this has been released in Asia. 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.000
 This thing was released there, you see. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.350
 here behind the envelope 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 unlike the Brazilian for example 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.450
 that the Brazilian is not so in the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.870
 vertical and not behind her, and behind her lying down 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.170
 but here it is not that he is standing too and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.149
 Look at the personal writing here that was 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 printed by panini modena in italy 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.609
 Okay, so this one at the factory. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 Do not worry about the people in Asia. 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:17.520
 Jose has other sayings here in other 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:18.960
 languages ​​on the left side 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 People, I'll do the following, I'll open. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.150
 to see if there is any difference're 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 right 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.270
 ah I do not think there will be any 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.350
 difference 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.799
 but you know how it is, let's try it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.270
 once again the intelligence staff 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.549
 staff is there is no danger that it is okay 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.860
 It is dangerous if it will be cut, so it is better. 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.280
 you take the risk do not take the risk 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.700
 What can you see in a good way? 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.280
