00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
folding it right again certainly if

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.450 
folding it right again certainly if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
absolutely no reason to yeah I said just

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
absolutely no reason to yeah I said just
expecting<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.399> yeah<00:00:53.760> he's<00:00:54.359> probably

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
expecting that like yeah he's probably

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.939 
expecting that like yeah he's probably
gonna<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.170> wide<00:00:55.320> 3<00:00:55.559> bidding<00:00:55.770> range

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
gonna have a pretty wide 3 bidding range

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.009 
gonna have a pretty wide 3 bidding range
which<00:00:56.190> means<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.719> do

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
which means like it actually really do

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.500 
which means like it actually really do
not<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.059> surprised<00:01:00.059> by<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
not like this I'm very surprised by this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.709 
not like this I'm very surprised by this
play<00:01:00.870> okay<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.059> maybe<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.600> was

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
play okay um but you know maybe it was

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.280 
play okay um but you know maybe it was
just<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:05.940> mean<00:01:06.600> certainly<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:08.900> a<00:01:09.900> point

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
just I mean certainly there's a point

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
just I mean certainly there's a point
where<00:01:10.590> someone<00:01:11.009> would<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> wear

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
where someone would want to wear

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
where someone would want to wear
someone's<00:01:12.299> calling<00:01:12.689> wide<00:01:12.900> enough<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> where

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
someone's calling wide enough to where

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340 
someone's calling wide enough to where
you'd<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> okay<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.150> I'd<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you'd want to do this okay but I'd be

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.240 
you'd want to do this okay but I'd be
surprised<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.930> we<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.680> put<00:01:19.890> him<00:01:20.040> on

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
surprised if we if you could put him on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
surprised if we if you could put him on
that<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> fresh<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> definitely<00:01:22.409> don't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that sort of fresh so I definitely don't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.330 
that sort of fresh so I definitely don't
like<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.689> three<00:01:24.840> bit<00:01:25.020> here

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
like this I think if you three bit here

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
like this I think if you three bit here
I'm<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.970> hesitant<00:01:27.329> with<00:01:27.689> free<00:01:27.810> betting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I'm a little hesitant with free betting

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.480 
I'm a little hesitant with free betting
the<00:01:28.229> first<00:01:28.470> place<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> smaller

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the first place but I think a smaller

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.890 
the first place but I think a smaller
size<00:01:29.700> makes<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.390> sense<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
size makes a little bit more sense it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.399 
size makes a little bit more sense it
makes<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.960> what<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:33.990> rough

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
makes it more like what more rough

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
makes it more like what more rough
framing<00:01:34.619> normal<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.790> him<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> get

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
framing normal need to get him to get

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
framing normal need to get him to get
the<00:01:36.450> widest<00:01:36.810> range<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.890> sugar<00:01:38.369> that's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the widest range of all sugar that's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
the widest range of all sugar that's
that's<00:01:39.030> ideal<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.960> overall<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.590> don't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's ideal and I think overall I don't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's ideal and I think overall I don't
like<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.340> yeah<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.930> only<00:01:42.930> thing<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> size

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
like this yeah I only thing the size

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.350 
like this yeah I only thing the size
makes<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.860> comfortable<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.399> bed<00:01:45.270> as

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
makes it more comfortable for bed as

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.889 
makes it more comfortable for bed as
well<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> too<00:01:46.619> flat<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:48.180> mean
