average this or they shot this but test
alone<00:02:46.099> kind<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.609> gives<00:02:46.849> you<00:02:46.939> idea<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.510> how<00:02:47.659> much

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
alone kind of gives you idea of how much

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.270 
alone kind of gives you idea of how much
they<00:02:47.930> know<00:02:48.109> about<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.500> game<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:49.099> know<00:02:49.189> how

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
they know about the game you know how

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800 
they know about the game you know how
much<00:02:49.370> more<00:02:49.579> they<00:02:49.670> might<00:02:49.819> need<00:02:49.909> to<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
much more they might need to know and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.000 
much more they might need to know and
also<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.079> thought<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.349> coach<00:02:51.500> ability<00:02:51.889> was

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
also I thought the coach ability was

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.899 
also I thought the coach ability was
very<00:02:52.189> interesting<00:02:52.609> as<00:02:52.700> well<00:02:52.730> because

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
very interesting as well because

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.129 
very interesting as well because
obviously<00:02:53.840> coach<00:02:54.170> ability<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.950> big<00:02:55.129> factor

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
obviously coach ability is a big factor

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.599 
obviously coach ability is a big factor

through four different tests terms of

through four different tests terms of
