00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
in order to avoid stopping the heart the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
in order to avoid stopping the heart the

through small holes on a patient star X

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.830 
through small holes on a patient star X
so<00:00:43.500> through<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.070> small<00:00:44.910> incisions<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so through these small incisions in a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
so through these small incisions in a
patient's<00:00:46.200> body<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.860> surgeon<00:00:47.250> defines<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
patient's body the surgeon defines a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.940 
patient's body the surgeon defines a
region<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> interest<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.350> able<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
region of interest we are able to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.330 
region of interest we are able to
estimate<00:00:50.640> its<00:00:51.239> motion<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.960> 3d<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.980> robot

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
estimate its motion in 3d the robot

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.170 
estimate its motion in 3d the robot
tracks<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> motion<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.010> moves

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
tracks this motion and moves

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.069 
tracks this motion and moves
synchronously<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.719> beating<00:00:57.989> heart

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
synchronously with the beating heart

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
synchronously with the beating heart
ocean<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> surgeon<00:00:59.760> can<00:01:00.090> perform

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
ocean so that the surgeon can perform

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110 
ocean so that the surgeon can perform
his<00:01:00.899> gesture<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.530> he<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.219> operating<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
his gesture as if he was operating in a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.810 
his gesture as if he was operating in a
virtually<00:01:03.809> stable<00:01:04.289> environment

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 

the<00:01:09.300> problem<00:01:09.690> here<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.740> volume

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the problem here is actually the volume

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.330 
the problem here is actually the volume
of<00:01:11.250> data<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.060> treat<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:14.040> heart

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
of data that you have to treat the heart

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.940 
of data that you have to treat the heart
moves<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.510> high<00:01:15.570> speeds<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.530> therefore

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
moves at very high speeds so therefore

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.250 
moves at very high speeds so therefore
you<00:01:17.070> actually<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.820> visualize<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.050> heart

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
you actually have to visualize the heart

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.620 
you actually have to visualize the heart
motion<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:20.010> very<00:01:20.220> high<00:01:20.280> speed<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:21.270> order<00:01:21.510> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
motion at a very high speed in order to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.510 
motion at a very high speed in order to
do<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> acquire<00:01:22.830> images<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
do that we have to acquire images at a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240 
do that we have to acquire images at a
much<00:01:23.760> higher<00:01:23.810> frame<00:01:24.810> rate<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.590> demands<00:01:26.160> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
much higher frame rate that demands a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.090 
much higher frame rate that demands a
lot<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.550> computational<00:01:27.210> power<00:01:27.860> until<00:01:28.860> very

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
lot of computational power until very

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
lot of computational power until very
recently<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.600> didn't<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
recently we didn't have the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
recently we didn't have the
computational<00:01:31.860> power<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.400> process<00:01:32.880> these

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
computational power to process these

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.510 
computational power to process these
images<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.780> count<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:35.160> only<00:01:35.310> with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
images as they count it was only with

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
images as they count it was only with
the<00:01:35.640> GPU<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.300> this<00:01:36.750> became<00:01:37.020> possible

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the GPU that this became possible

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
the GPU that this became possible
because<00:01:37.950> before<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.540> computational<00:01:40.140> power

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
because before the computational power

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
because before the computational power
was<00:01:40.500> too<00:01:40.680> expensive<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.880> simply

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
was too expensive or it was simply

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
was too expensive or it was simply
impossible<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:43.170> perform<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.070> algorithms

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
impossible to perform the algorithms

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
impossible to perform the algorithms
that<00:01:44.820> were<00:01:45.240> needed<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.780> order<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> achieve

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that were needed in order to achieve

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
that were needed in order to achieve
this<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:49.050> motivates<00:01:49.619> us<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:51.240> keep

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this we actually motivates us to to keep

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.719 
this we actually motivates us to to keep
working<00:01:51.600> towards<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.289> such<00:01:53.160> a<00:01:53.190> system<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
working towards this such a system is

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.020 
working towards this such a system is
the<00:01:54.539> possibility<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.440> expanding<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.670> motion

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the possibility of expanding the motion

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
the possibility of expanding the motion

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
to enable surgeons to perform even more

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that today are not possible we're

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.509 
that today are not possible we're
actually<00:02:08.220> hoping<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:10.440> something<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.130> is

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
actually hoping to do something that is

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.400 
actually hoping to do something that is
going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> change<00:02:12.180> medicine<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.989> that's<00:02:13.019> going

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
going to change medicine so that's going

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
going to change medicine so that's going
to<00:02:13.500> provide<00:02:14.489> surgeons<00:02:15.030> with<00:02:15.390> more

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
to provide surgeons with more
