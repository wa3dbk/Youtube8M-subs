00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
you have the ability to create sub pages
within<00:01:23.250> pages<00:01:23.670> almost<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> hierarchy<00:01:24.930> or

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
within pages almost like a hierarchy or

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.060 
within pages almost like a hierarchy or
a<00:01:25.049> tree<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.740> paging<00:01:26.640> sections<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> good

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
example right here is actually the one

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
example right here is actually the one
that's<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:30.960> below<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that's right below it basically if you

they're usually ordered alphabetically

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.020

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
and that pretty much covers pages like I

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580 
and that pretty much covers pages like I
said<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.300> lot<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:51.840> posts<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.470> you're

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
going to grasp this pretty quickly so

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.270 
going to grasp this pretty quickly so
those<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> only<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:56.010> main

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
those are the only really main

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.880 
those are the only really main
differences<00:02:56.850> about<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> page<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.020> all<00:02:58.740> right
