00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.080
 I bought it received during the month of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.519
 January 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 The first book was the book I 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.080
 I bought it I was super super anxious 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.379
 to read that the failure of the last of the saga 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 xuxa written by becca fitzpatrick 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.109
 The free is so wonderful I'm in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.400
 half of the book I'm very much 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.170
 anxious to finish the book 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.699
 especially when it is a book that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 ends a room then that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 expectation of how the author 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 build outcome as will be the outcome 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 of the plot then there is only that one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 feel that society then very much 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 very anxious and I loved the cover of the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 book and I bought nothing for him he 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.280
 We arrived without problems tone Love 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.829
 reading current reading 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.449
 I received from the publisher courtesy gull 60 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 count the minutes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.980
 I feel for the majority a history of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.500
 cinema that autoeuropa is not is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 writer as she is also an illustrator 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 then the book is written and illustrated by 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.220
 she 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 the book is very much fire has several 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 graphic 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.729
 the next book received to burst 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 madras the passage 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 the book is small enough to be enough 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.750
 tiring but I have not yet started 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 reading seems to be an interesting game 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 The next book I received from the new publisher 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 century and it was a surprise because 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.729
 who is the publisher 's partner knows that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.220
 found the litle bride for the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 partners will only go monthly sweepstakes 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 that if you're really lucky and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 show up i was never kissed 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.530
 was a partner year of the new century ever 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 I've never been drawn and I do not know 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.460
 nobody wants to be closed and it was a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 surprise to find the name she was there 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 in the draw including the staff spoke 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.610
 Our finally know someone who gave 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.979
 the book of the new century and also 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.110
 intended for burial 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.869
 I still did not know this saga much 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 less work of the author and I hope 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.619
 I just like that I do not know if it's a book 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 is the first the second or third knots 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.710
 I did not get to research but when 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.780
 obviously start reading 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.810
 research on the book and it seems 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.510
 interesting deals a lot on the natural 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.780
 so I do not really know what to expect 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.269
 favorite book was still very 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.370
 anxious to buy too much 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.189
 I said that he will reactivate this 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930
 hail in reality often always 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.939
 we get there the woman lunch spoke 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.099
 who did not have that was missing and who 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.920
 had recommended to arrive and I stayed 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.540
 so I got frustrated because I 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.489
 I was not with the book, so I 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.609
 I decided to ask online for the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.140
 submarine and eventually it arrived 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.019
 super-fast hot blood 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.250
 I love honey for those who do not know people 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.989
 This book inspired the movie, my boyfriend. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.760
 a zombie in reality that is a 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.829
 adaptation of the book I know why they 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.690
 they chose the title my boyfriend came 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.769
 because it has nothing to do with blood 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.989
 Hot, but the book is fantastic. 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.069
 This author is wonderful. 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.230
 he turned that way from my authors 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.120
 2013 Favorite already at the top already 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.090
 Do you watch the movie trailer you? 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.099
 will think it's a silly book and many 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.129
 was already compared to the twilight people 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.609
 I do not know where and in what place the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.919
 people took away who knows how to complain 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.019
 inspiration to the new twilight, 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.879
 There's nothing silly about this book. 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.410
 in fact the book brings many 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.569
 issues that will make the voter 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.000
 reflect on various things that he 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.940
 addresses the current situations of society 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.739
 Can you make a comparison? 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.109
 incredible comparative I loved the book 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.760
 Account recording it is fantastic I 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.549
 I will show the details for you when 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.400
 I make a video with the readings of the month 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.989
 but I brought a favorite from 2013 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.760
 It's impossible not to be delighted with the book. 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.819
 I super recommend for everyone to see 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.799
 for that book so one day so super 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.180
 super recommend hot blood 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.669
 the next county to receive the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.260
 story, I want the best of me and neither 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.510
 by the parties 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.470
 I do not know the books with which I 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.970
 they always bring something amazing 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 so I honestly do not know what to expect 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.989
 The best of me ends up very much. 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.130
 Beautiful, I love it, I hope I like the book. 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.260
 Maria will receive from the intrinsic publisher 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.459
 and it's a book that's being super 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.320
 commented the social networks 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.200
 mainly because the film 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.720
 it goes 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.840
 Andrea if I'm not mistaken February together 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.170
 with my boyfriend a zombie book it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.870
 The good side of life is that you are a 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.510
 beautiful beautiful beautiful I so loved the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.970
 book that her recording is very cute and 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.710
 I hope to start reading until the beginning of 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.080
 next week if possible at the end of 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.790
 week but I know she'll never come to me 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.790
 disappoint because I've read some 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.120
 times some reviews about it too 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.920
 and everyone compliments this book so I 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600
 I hope you do not disappoint the book and I 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.210
 I feel I have the impression that I 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.510
 I will not disappoint very very beautiful 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 next books are two you make 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.600
 part of a saga type marine case 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.940
 and it is only when a discount of 15 to 20 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.040
 books so I found that 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.680
 it was valid to make the purchase and when 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.140
 commented on these books because 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.040
 they were controversial as were the 50 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:24.700
 shades of gray that are the books all his 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:29.560
 and deeply yours they are part 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:34.330
 of this new wave that is taking of books 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.680
 shut up, I do not know if it's better than 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.950
 Talk because it 's something else. 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.350
 anyway I do not know how the writing is 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.370
 better that it became difficult I think 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.080
 any book themes that also 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.310
 the clouds of gray but she 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.230
 know what to expect from the book I looked pro 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.510
 curiosity just to say so I 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.440
 I know what I'm talking about in what will come a 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.100
 ignorant not knowing how to criticize knowing 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.170
 and it 's a bag so Christmas has the same 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.480
 building science 50 promptly 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.310
 no problem the past not only now a 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.830
 protagonist as both the man 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.450
 how much time did women have 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.560
 childhood problems and they have to 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:19.360
 deal with it and everything else who 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.700
 like who likes to go do not know what has 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.290
 Curiosity of cold water plot is not a 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.010
 book as you play outside in the 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:30.180
 reality of super good ale and has the 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.180
 third book to be released

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.720
 i bought it all its deep south 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.760
 whose book is no less important is the 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.560
 book I was super super eager to 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.660
 received and suddenly courtesy of 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.980
 which was intrinsic label thief 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.050
 fossa rays

 he is part is the first book of the saga 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:55.310
 by jackson people that's how I devoured 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.040
 This book loved everyone. 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.470
 made it abundantly clear that I did not 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.750
 I was going to be disappointed with how healthy it was 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.180
 I got the book I started to read and I did not 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.800
 I could finish without preaching the reading 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.900
 Could not stay all day reading 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.370
 the book that I'm very much 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.130
 fierce by the others 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.770
 I'm holding on to not buying and only 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.830
 one by one through the publisher and only 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.750
 is one by one through the publisher is 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.150
 getting difficult because the story a lot 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.270
 very good is this people I hope you

 It's been a long time since I 've been there. 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.660

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.850

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.290
