00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.610
 in this new block comes to the section 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.680
 that allows us to analyze each component 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.840
 of our vehicle for its correct 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.179
 maintenance at the time of sharing 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.179
 a new dossier delivery workshop looks 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 the ignition system of the cars 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070
 current is a true gem of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 electronic science with components 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.989
 integrated that stand out for their 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.920
 remarkable efficiency do not have parts 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.840
 mobile phones and have a long lifespan 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.579
 but the electromechanical systems and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 electronic of previous generations 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.399
 still of massive presence in our 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.229
 country require maintenance and in all 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.750
 the systems are already last 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.440
 generation or conventional spark plugs 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.130
 they must be inspected cleaned and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 eventually changed 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.659
 When you study carefully the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 history of the automobile one technique 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 he finds surprises when he finds out 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.590
 through qualified sources of the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 automotive engineering that for example 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.310
 the rolls-royce of the spark plugs in the century 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.799
 twenty 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.049
 has been the golden slice of origin 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.930
 English although also manufactured in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.430
 Italy 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 considered by specialists 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 Europeans as the best spark plug in 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.570
 ignition of all times and the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.570
 preferred by many manufacturers as 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.490
 alfa romeo and ferrari includes 4 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 mass electrodes and a circuit 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.450
 internal electronics that has a micro 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.760
 capacitor that forms a circuit 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.700
 oscillating and also a jumping space 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.970
 of previous spark called structure 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 of gold metallic body this singular 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.180
 spark plug stopped being manufactured but not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.880
 get yourself with a little effort 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.910
 currently in the usa the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.319
 spark plug whose operation is almost 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 identical to golden 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.629
 however in the local market it is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.239
 possible to acquire excellent spark plugs 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.450
 quality that little have to envy to 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.430
 these special models and everything 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.950
 exposed shows that what many 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.889
 they kept as inexorable truths 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.629
 for decades and to this day in 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.939
 the sense that breaks sparks 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.700
 previous and the internal capacitors of 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.389
 the spark plugs are useless 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.389
 wrong 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 If our car still has a 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.600
 conventional ignition with distributor 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 and platinum we can do some 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.040
 jobs if we have certain 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.800
 mechanical knowledge and a little bit of 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.470
 practice 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.090
 for example we could regulate the light of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 the platinums controlling that the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.070
 contacts of the same ones are not chopped 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.190
 or burnt what forces them to replace them 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.930
 and also regulate the initial advance of 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.570
 the spark by moving the body of the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.910
 dealer and even change the 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.450
 condenser and remove clean and replace 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.400
 spark plugs likewise devote ourselves to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.860
 check the condition of the cables 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.680
 low and high voltage coil 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.380
 distributor and the spark plugs and verify 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.960
 your good contact 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.510
 in conventional distributors there are 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.820
 a lung or camera to advance through 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.830
 Ignition vacuum that is connected 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.620
 internally to the mechanism of advance and 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.840
 externally and by means of a tube at 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.940
 engine intake system 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.590
 you have to check that this tube is 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.930
 find yourself well adjusted in your 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.330
 connections and that does not show signs of 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.330
 scratches or that is very soft 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.209
 in any case and if there are doubts the best 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.150
 will change it the same thing happens with the 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.280
 spark plugs if when removing them we see that they have 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.830
 its worn electrodes 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.169
 it is not necessary to clean them and return them to 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.329
 install though so they could continue 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.010
 lasting and with the engine working well 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.410
 the best thing is to change the complete game 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.600
 keep in mind that the jump of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.730
 sparks in the spark plugs inside the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.330
 combustion chamber ignites a 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.910
 true hell you call thousands of 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.010
 grades combustion products of the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.460
 air and fuel mixture 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.860
 they attack the spark plugs for their daring the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.590
 they are also subject to strong 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.170
 chemical and mechanical stresses and 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.750
 that is why we must change them every 20 thousand 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.420
 kilometers when they are conventional or 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.050
 maybe every 100,000 kilometers if they are 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.590
 of platinum or other precious metal 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.440
 and let's not forget the distributor rotor 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.110
 a small economic element and that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.419
 fulfills a vital mission that of 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.669
 distribute the high attention that comes from 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.889
 the coil to the contacts of the stage 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.889
 of the distributor and thus to the spark plugs 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.700
 the rotor is encased in a single 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.980
 Possible position at the shaft end 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.980
 of the distributor so we will not fear 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.140
 when removing it you have to verify its 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.260
 metal upper contact sheet or 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.630
 bronze and replace it when we notice that 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.450
 is worn by sparks and 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.400
 slightly burned the rotor is left 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.590
 easily accessible when removing the lid 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.800
 distributor which is subject to 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.170
 body through springs clips more 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.060
 down are the platinums and maybe the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.790
 condenser 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.060
 below are still the 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:56.300
 Centrifugal advancements of the ignition parts 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.830
 which only the electrician has access to 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.830
 disarm the distributor 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.120
 in our next meeting we will continue 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.050
 analyzing the ignition system of a 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:13.870
 vehicle here right yesterday 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.870
 dossier aftermarket solutions 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.600
