and now I'm going to turn to the
Lightning<00:01:30.020> port<00:01:30.260> so<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.530> can<00:01:30.740> see<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.070> I'm

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
Lightning port so you can see what I'm

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.690 
Lightning port so you can see what I'm
doing<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.210> use<00:01:32.390> two<00:01:32.840> toothpicks<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
doing it you use two toothpicks the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.240 
doing it you use two toothpicks the
first<00:01:34.970> one<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.420> going<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.050> go<00:01:36.200> all<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.920> way<00:01:36.950> to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
first one is going to go all the way to

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.070 
first one is going to go all the way to
the<00:01:37.369> right<00:01:38.830> here<00:01:40.299> make<00:01:41.299> sure<00:01:41.330> it's<00:01:41.600> all<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
the right here make sure it's all the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.180 
the right here make sure it's all the
way<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.500> right<00:01:42.530> as<00:01:43.340> far<00:01:43.550> as<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.759> can<00:01:43.970> go

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
way to the right as far as you can go

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.940 
way to the right as far as you can go
and<00:01:46.190> this<00:01:46.369> one

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and this one

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.270 
and this one
some<00:01:48.700> go<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.090> left

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
some go to the left

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.149 
some go to the left
now<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.350> simulates<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:55.830> lightning<00:01:56.830> cable

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
now this simulates a lightning cable

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.399 
now this simulates a lightning cable
being<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.580> your<00:01:57.700> device<00:01:58.060> without<00:01:58.900> actually

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
being in your device without actually

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.350 
being in your device without actually
transmitting<00:01:59.920> power<00:02:00.190> which<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.970> what<00:02:01.180> turns

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
transmitting power which is what turns

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.920 
transmitting power which is what turns
on<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.890> iPad<00:02:02.890> automatically<00:02:03.790> plug<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
on the iPad automatically plug in the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.290 
on the iPad automatically plug in the
cable<00:02:05.229> it's<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.740> sensor<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.970> now<00:02:07.090> you're

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
cable it's like a sensor so now you're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.779 
cable it's like a sensor so now you're
going<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.540> turn<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.840> device<00:02:07.960> around<00:02:08.580> okay<00:02:09.580> my

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
going to turn the device around okay my

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.980 
going to turn the device around okay my
thing<00:02:10.780> finally<00:02:11.050> only<00:02:11.470> just<00:02:11.680> venting

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.250 

you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.500 

you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.940 

slightly<00:02:21.510> difficult<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.050> keep<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.350> man<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.740> I'm
