all<00:00:28.240> our<00:00:28.420> ventures<00:00:28.810> rolled<00:00:29.050> around<00:00:29.170> again<00:00:29.650> and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
all our ventures rolled around again and

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.130 
all our ventures rolled around again and
you<00:00:30.340> rolled<00:00:30.640> an<00:00:30.790> airplane<00:00:31.180> from<00:00:31.450> Canada<00:00:31.990> all

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
you rolled an airplane from Canada all

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.100 
you rolled an airplane from Canada all
the<00:00:32.169> way<00:00:32.349> over<00:00:32.590> here<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.980> did<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.850> this<00:00:34.840> time<00:00:34.989> we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
the way over here I did and this time we

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.660 
the way over here I did and this time we
thought<00:00:35.140> we'd<00:00:35.380> leave<00:00:35.500> it<00:00:35.650> naked<00:00:35.830> so<00:00:36.400> that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
thought we'd leave it naked so that

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.640 
thought we'd leave it naked so that
people<00:00:37.270> can<00:00:37.390> see<00:00:37.570> what's<00:00:38.080> inside<00:00:38.290> the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
people can see what's inside the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
there it comes in two different ways we

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.070 
there it comes in two different ways we

because<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.140> drill<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.470> during<00:01:14.770> rigging<00:01:15.130> but

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
because you drill it during rigging but

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.370 
because you drill it during rigging but
essentially<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.690> get<00:01:16.840> all<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.229> components

build kid will knock 200 hours off of

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.890 
build kid will knock 200 hours off of
that<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:15.580> airplane<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.360> did<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.599> first

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that now this airplane when did it first

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110 
that now this airplane when did it first
come<00:02:17.140> out<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.650> mark<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.700> would<00:02:18.879> have<00:02:19.000> come

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
come out for the mark it would have come

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.380 
come out for the mark it would have come
out<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.769> mid<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.950> late<00:02:21.129> 80s<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.239> been

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
out in the mid to late 80s so it's been

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.610 
out in the mid to late 80s so it's been
around<00:02:22.480> for<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> while<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.230> there<00:02:23.349> are<00:02:23.440> quite<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
around for a while and there are quite a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
around for a while and there are quite a
few<00:02:23.709> flying

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
few flying

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.540 
few flying
now<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:25.080> go<00:02:25.260> out<00:02:25.349> onto<00:02:25.590> YouTube<00:02:26.220> or<00:02:26.370> something

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
now you go out onto YouTube or something

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.910 
now you go out onto YouTube or something
you<00:02:27.360> see<00:02:27.599> pictures<00:02:27.930> suit<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.379> kinds<00:02:28.860> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you see pictures suit all kinds of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.149 
you see pictures suit all kinds of
different<00:02:28.980> shapes<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.330> colors<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.440> schemes

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
different shapes and colors and schemes

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.250 
different shapes and colors and schemes
on<00:02:32.370> yeah<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.450> that's<00:02:33.780> correct

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
on yeah that is that's correct

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.380 
on yeah that is that's correct
and<00:02:34.909> speaking<00:02:35.909> of<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.980> what<00:02:37.980> we're

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and speaking of that but what we're

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.030 
and speaking of that but what we're
looking<00:02:39.390> at<00:02:39.510> covering<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.590> aircraft

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
looking at covering this this aircraft

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250 
looking at covering this this aircraft
with<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.790> new<00:02:42.360> material<00:02:42.480> that's<00:02:42.900> coming

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
with now is a new material that's coming

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.470 
with now is a new material that's coming
in<00:02:43.349> from<00:02:43.860> Germany<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.489> called<00:02:44.700> aura<00:02:44.879> Tex<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
in from Germany it's called aura Tex and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.839 
in from Germany it's called aura Tex and
the<00:02:46.379> advantage<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.129> material<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.700> it

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the advantage of this material is it

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.390 
the advantage of this material is it
comes<00:02:48.030> pre<00:02:48.360> colored<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> when<00:02:50.250> you're

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
comes pre colored and so when you're

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.890 
comes pre colored and so when you're
finishing<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:50.940> don't<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.239> any<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
finishing it you don't have any of the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.330 
finishing it you don't have any of the
chemicals<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.090> time<00:02:54.629> needed<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.620> finish

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
chemicals or the time needed to finish

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.740 
chemicals or the time needed to finish
the<00:02:56.579> aircraft<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.150> go<00:02:57.360> from<00:02:57.629> an

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the aircraft you can go from an

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.150 
the aircraft you can go from an
uncovered<00:02:58.200> aircraft<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.829> a<00:02:58.860> finished

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
uncovered aircraft to a finished

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.759 
uncovered aircraft to a finished
aircraft<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.849> about<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.360> week<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.560> like

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
aircraft in about a week so this is like

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.949 
aircraft in about a week so this is like
it<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.190> look<00:03:02.609> at<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.959> original

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
it when you look at that original

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.050 
it when you look at that original
covered<00:03:04.590> material<00:03:05.099> would<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.760> shrunk

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
covered material would have to be shrunk

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.059 
covered material would have to be shrunk
this<00:03:06.480> all<00:03:06.660> ties<00:03:06.870> weaker<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.470> also<00:03:07.650> has<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.040> be

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
this all ties weaker this also has to be

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.699 
this all ties weaker this also has to be
shrunk<00:03:09.019> traditional<00:03:10.019> covering<00:03:10.319> material

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
shrunk traditional covering material

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.430 
shrunk traditional covering material
you're<00:03:10.829> putting<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.190> Dacron<00:03:12.180> fabric<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.870> you're

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
you're putting a Dacron fabric on you're

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.170 
you're putting a Dacron fabric on you're
applying<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.099> your<00:03:14.250> heat<00:03:14.400> shrinking<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.000> you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
applying it your heat shrinking it you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.559 
applying it your heat shrinking it you
have<00:03:15.329> two<00:03:15.510> coats<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:16.079> we<00:03:16.769> feel<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.940> fill<00:03:18.239> sorry

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
have two coats of we feel we fill sorry

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.500 
have two coats of we feel we fill sorry
then<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.879> two<00:03:20.879> or<00:03:21.030> three<00:03:21.180> coats<00:03:21.390> of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
then you have two or three coats of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.539 
then you have two or three coats of
color<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.410> you're<00:03:22.620> dealing<00:03:23.069> with<00:03:23.280> some

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
color on it and you're dealing with some

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.789 
color on it and you're dealing with some
fairly<00:03:23.849> dangerous<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.900> also<00:03:25.109> jump<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.620> be

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
fairly dangerous can also jump to you be

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.210 
fairly dangerous can also jump to you be
barrier<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.579> over<00:03:26.819> nitro<00:03:27.090> correct<00:03:28.220> with

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
barrier it's over nitro correct with

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
barrier it's over nitro correct with
this<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.540> done<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
this it that all that is done at the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.720 
this it that all that is done at the
factory<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.590> you're<00:03:31.739> literally<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
factory and you're literally just

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
factory and you're literally just
ironing<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> structure

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
ironing it on to the to the structure

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
ironing it on to the to the structure
and<00:03:35.310> then<00:03:35.430> shrinking<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.389> it<00:03:36.599> makes<00:03:36.720> it

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
and then shrinking it so it makes it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.720 
and then shrinking it so it makes it
much<00:03:36.989> quicker<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.470> much<00:03:37.889> healthier<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> do

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
much quicker and much healthier to do

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.909 
much quicker and much healthier to do
now<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.660> were<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:40.049> order<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.590> though

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
now if you were to order that though

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.520 
now if you were to order that though
would<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.579> know<00:03:41.910> exactly<00:03:42.450> how<00:03:42.599> much<00:03:42.750> fabric<00:03:43.319> a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
would you know exactly how much fabric a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.629 
would you know exactly how much fabric a
person<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.919> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> need<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.549> this
