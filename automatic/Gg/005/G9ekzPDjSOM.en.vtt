00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
welcome back to wiring products we are

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.610 
welcome back to wiring products we are
going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> talk<00:00:09.360> about<00:00:09.540> our<00:00:09.929> line<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.410> butt

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
going to talk about our line of butt

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.720 
going to talk about our line of butt
splices<00:00:11.719> these<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:13.110> butt<00:00:13.530> splices<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.549> these

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
splices these are butt splices and these

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.300 
splices these are butt splices and these
are<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.450> quick<00:00:15.870> disconnect<00:00:16.379> these<00:00:17.100> are<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
are not a quick disconnect these are a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.540 
are not a quick disconnect these are a
solid<00:00:17.699> connection<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:19.170> when<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.650> put<00:00:20.400> these

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
solid connection so when you put these

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.179 
solid connection so when you put these
together<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.990> wiring<00:00:22.470> something<00:00:23.070> in

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
together and you are wiring something in

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.580 
together and you are wiring something in
your<00:00:23.310> vehicle<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.080> something<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
your vehicle this is not something that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
your vehicle this is not something that
you<00:00:25.769> could<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.010> easily<00:00:26.369> pull<00:00:26.730> apart<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.449> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you could just easily pull apart this is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.259 
you could just easily pull apart this is
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.930> something<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.529> solid

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
going to be something that is solid

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.470 
going to be something that is solid
these<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.689> bright<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.850> our<00:00:32.850> line<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
these are bright in here is our line of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
these are bright in here is our line of
non<00:00:33.780> insulated<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.739> supply<00:00:35.100> system<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.700> go

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
non insulated but supply system they go

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.540 
non insulated but supply system they go
from<00:00:36.180> 22<00:00:36.780> gauge<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.340> way<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.270> 3<00:00:40.200> OTT

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
from 22 gauge all the way up to 3 OTT

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
from 22 gauge all the way up to 3 OTT
these<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.329> soldered<00:00:42.750> instead<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> crimped

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
these can be soldered instead of crimped

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
these can be soldered instead of crimped
the<00:00:44.850> smaller<00:00:45.600> ones<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.110> could<00:00:46.320> crimp<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the smaller ones you could crimp the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330 
the smaller ones you could crimp the
larger<00:00:47.700> ones<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.059> recommend<00:00:48.239> soldering<00:00:49.340> these

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
larger ones I recommend soldering these

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.170 
larger ones I recommend soldering these
over<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:51.449> our<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.489> high<00:00:53.489> temperature

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
over here are our our high temperature

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.189 
over here are our our high temperature
but<00:00:54.510> splices<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:56.570> they<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> way

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but splices and they they go all the way

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.790 
but splices and they they go all the way
up<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.739> 900<00:00:59.489> degrees<00:00:59.850> Fahrenheit<00:01:00.530> these<00:01:01.530> are

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit these are

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit these are
the<00:01:01.920> butt<00:01:02.070> splices<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the butt splices that you would want to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.980 
the butt splices that you would want to
use<00:01:03.660> around<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.350> engine<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.840> around<00:01:06.840> your

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
use around your engine and around your
