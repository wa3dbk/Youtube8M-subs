that highway fatalities are up three

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.009 
that highway fatalities are up three
percent<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.220> after<00:00:26.910> months<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.689> even

years of declines and as you know there

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.430 
years of declines and as you know there
are<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:32.279> high-tech<00:00:33.000> safety<00:00:33.690> systems<00:00:34.260> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
are more high-tech safety systems on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.090 
are more high-tech safety systems on
cars<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.040> ever<00:00:35.309> before<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> perhaps<00:00:37.649> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
cars than ever before so perhaps it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.580 
cars than ever before so perhaps it
isn't<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.579> car<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> perfect<00:00:40.170> time

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
isn't the car this is the perfect time

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.500 
isn't the car this is the perfect time
for<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> talk<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:42.329> personal<00:00:43.190> safety

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
for me to talk about my personal safety

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.080 
for me to talk about my personal safety
philosophy<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.260> safety<00:00:47.129> begins<00:00:47.489> at

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
philosophy and that is safety begins at

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.270 
philosophy and that is safety begins at
