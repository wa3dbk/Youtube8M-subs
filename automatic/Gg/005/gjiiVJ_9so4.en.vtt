surprising<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.700> hear<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.939> guy<00:01:12.090> say<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> don't<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
surprising to hear a guy say I don't I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
surprising to hear a guy say I don't I
don't<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> start<00:01:13.710> yeah<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> don't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
don't I don't want to start yeah I don't
care<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.150> guess<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.200> start<00:01:16.560> him
