00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
rushing it seems like the pressure maybe

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
rushing it seems like the pressure maybe
a<00:01:08.369> little<00:01:08.490> bit<00:01:08.640> off<00:01:08.729> Tyson<00:01:09.240> Jackson

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
a little bit off Tyson Jackson

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
a little bit off Tyson Jackson
restructures<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> deal<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> comes<00:01:11.490> back

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
restructures is deal kind of comes back

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
restructures is deal kind of comes back
maybe<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.180> maybe<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> mystique<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> being

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
maybe that maybe the mystique of being

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
maybe that maybe the mystique of being
that<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.710> high<00:01:13.830> draft<00:01:14.100> pick<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.610> him<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that that high draft pick is off him and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.160 
that that high draft pick is off him and
he<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> settle<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.780> play<00:01:15.930> yeah

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
he can kind of settle in and play yeah

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
he can kind of settle in and play yeah
definitely<00:01:16.320> he's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> guy<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> I've<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
definitely he's a guy that I've kind of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.880 
definitely he's a guy that I've kind of
feel<00:01:18.750> bad<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:18.930> him<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.380> he<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.619> picked

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
feel bad for him because he was picked

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.990 
feel bad for him because he was picked
her<00:01:20.009> overall<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.640> he's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> guy<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
her overall because he's a guy that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
her overall because he's a guy that
probably<00:01:21.270> should've<00:01:21.600> went<00:01:21.720> 14<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.290> 15<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
probably should've went 14 and 15 so the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.350 
probably should've went 14 and 15 so the
expectations<00:01:23.580> wouldn't<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.060> high<00:01:24.240> on

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
expectations wouldn't be that high on

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
expectations wouldn't be that high on
them<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.780> he's<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> guy<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.500> always<00:01:25.770> see

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
