 not published as a patch you say 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.119
 that nobody works anymore 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.880
 would

 no lyrics and no developer 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.810
 do it all alone and in his 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.670
 free time if that is not the time 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:26.730
 passion of a developer at play 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:28.980
 shows off the mini atomic bombs well 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.660
 catapult feldmann is one of the strongest 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.940
 weapons in the fallout series since it 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.190
 due to the nuclear ammunition whole 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.810
 armies can wipe was batman 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.050
 but also the code name of the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.989
 atombombe the over on 9 August 1945 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.000
 Nagasaki in Japan detonated due to 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.500
 the historical context became the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.600
 weapon in Japanese fallout 3 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 version renamed lucka launcher 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.260
 the bot boy is the mascot of the 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.230
 world tech group and the cult figure 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.840
 the fallout series in the typical pose 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.629
 give us the word from 1 fans and 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.250
 force us to the fans have to 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.040
 but a very own theory 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.409
 you see an atomic bomb explode 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.689
 keeps his thumb on the cloud 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.310
 and this disappears behind then 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.840
 one before the radiations and the one 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.689
 Pressure wave in safety 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.209
 in truth so wanted to be with this 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:36.269
 pose the distance to the bomb measure 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.459
 sounds a little bit outlandish or something 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.530
 the official security video from the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.530
 50 years was no better now 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.950
 with me 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.530
 the word choice pose is natural 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.900
 a very funny theory in the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.730
 reality but not applicable there 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.019
 a nuclear explosion four times brighter 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.489
 is as the sun is the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.080
 Probably high that one immediately 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.030
 would be blind if you were there 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.130
 looks into just one of the problems 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.660
 to call you to know more facts 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.010
 or private fallout series 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.390
 then I would be glad if you the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.840
 to write in the comments 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.840
 take care
