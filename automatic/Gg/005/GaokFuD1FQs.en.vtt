00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
program I now have two gtx 780 s when I
had<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.759> 6<00:00:12.000> 80's<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.540> played<00:00:12.840> assassin's<00:00:13.320> creed

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:07.090 

I<00:01:03.850> get<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> really<00:01:05.360> inconsistent<00:01:05.860> frame<00:01:06.860> rates

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
I get a really inconsistent frame rates

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.930 
I get a really inconsistent frame rates
and<00:01:07.430> incessant<00:01:07.910> scree<00:01:08.360> three<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:12.580> 6<00:01:13.580> 80's

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and incessant scree three on the 6 80's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.450 
and incessant scree three on the 6 80's
i<00:01:14.090> pry<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.330> breeze<00:01:14.690> around<00:01:14.990> 35<00:01:15.680> frames<00:01:16.220> per

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
i pry a breeze around 35 frames per

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.719 
i pry a breeze around 35 frames per
second<00:01:16.940> so<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.770> Ron<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.190> little<00:01:19.580> bit

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
second so this is Ron a little bit

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.880 
second so this is Ron a little bit
better<00:01:22.119> but<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:23.720> hasn't<00:01:24.229> been<00:01:24.380> quite<00:01:24.650> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
better but it hasn't been quite the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.370 
better but it hasn't been quite the
performance<00:01:25.400> boost<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.880> got<00:01:26.210> well<00:01:26.600> right<00:01:27.350> now

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
performance boost I got well right now

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.500 
performance boost I got well right now
it's<00:01:27.710> doing<00:01:28.369> pretty<00:01:28.400> well<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.270> way

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's doing pretty well but this way

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.410 
it's doing pretty well but this way
