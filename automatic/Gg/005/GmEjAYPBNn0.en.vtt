00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
did was just general cuts and I just

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.630 
did was just general cuts and I just
like<00:02:03.659> folded<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.319> in<00:02:04.500> central<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.429> just

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
like folded it in central and then just

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
like folded it in central and then just
did<00:02:05.789> little<00:02:06.030> snips<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.720> finish<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
did little snips and then finish them

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
did little snips and then finish them
off<00:02:07.289> with<00:02:07.319> like<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.830> line<00:02:08.100> cuts<00:02:08.519> which<00:02:08.789> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
off with like big line cuts which I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.400 
off with like big line cuts which I
really<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.019> is<00:02:10.079> like<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
really really like and this is like the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.830 
really really like and this is like the
easiest<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.329> just<00:02:12.480> did<00:02:12.630> this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
easiest one to do then I just did this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080 
easiest one to do then I just did this
to<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.170> next<00:02:13.500> leg<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.489> literally<00:02:14.880> all

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to the next leg and that's literally all

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.460 
to the next leg and that's literally all
you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.959> think<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.320> just

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you have to do and I think this just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.170 
you have to do and I think this just
makes<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.890> jeans<00:02:17.130> look<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.489> much<00:02:17.579> better<00:02:17.790> if

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
makes your jeans look so much better if

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.770 
makes your jeans look so much better if
you<00:02:18.269> don't<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.810> plain<00:02:19.110> normal<00:02:19.470> jeans

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
you don't like just plain normal jeans

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
you don't like just plain normal jeans
and<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.170> went<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.680> knee<00:02:22.950> beer<00:02:23.220> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then I went on to the knee beer and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.009 
and then I went on to the knee beer and
then<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.820> did<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> cut<00:02:24.299> on<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.480> knee<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
then I just did a cut on the knee and

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.170 
then I just did a cut on the knee and
you<00:02:25.470> obviously<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.250> wear<00:02:26.400> these<00:02:26.549> before

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you obviously have to wear these before

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.670 
you obviously have to wear these before
you<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.720> cut<00:02:27.959> because<00:02:28.109> it<00:02:28.410> might<00:02:28.530> not

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you do the cut because it might not

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.349 
you do the cut because it might not
actually<00:02:28.799> be<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.340> name<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.209> just

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
actually be on your name and then I just

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.300 
actually be on your name and then I just
gave<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.989> little<00:02:31.109> tug<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.680> stretched<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
gave it a little tug and stretched it a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
gave it a little tug and stretched it a
bit<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.670> make<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.359> have<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> more<00:02:33.840> warned

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
bit to make it like have a more warned

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.710 
bit to make it like have a more warned
affair<00:02:34.880> finally<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> put<00:02:36.269> them<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
affair finally I just put them on and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750 
affair finally I just put them on and
like<00:02:36.900> touched<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.680> some<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:37.950> cuts<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.609> make

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
like touched up some of my cuts to make

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.720 
like touched up some of my cuts to make
them<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.269> even<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.190> obviously<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
them all even and then obviously you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.640 
them all even and then obviously you
need<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.970> wash<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.450> turn<00:02:43.140> them<00:02:43.290> inside<00:02:43.440> out

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
need to wash them turn them inside out

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.140 
need to wash them turn them inside out
before<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> wash<00:02:44.310> them<00:02:44.519> because<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.820> gives<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
before you wash them because it gives a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.080 
before you wash them because it gives a
better<00:02:45.359> effect

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
better effect

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.910 
better effect
so<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.870> how<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.080> make<00:02:48.380> your<00:02:48.500> own<00:02:48.650> pair

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
so that is how you make your own pair

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:13.660 
so that is how you make your own pair
and<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.340> how<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.520> style<00:02:50.060> them

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.190 

and<00:03:14.670> they<00:03:14.760> also<00:03:14.940> decide<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.390> share<00:03:15.690> an<00:03:15.780> outfit

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and they also decide to share an outfit

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.750 
and they also decide to share an outfit
