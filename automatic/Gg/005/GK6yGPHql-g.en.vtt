00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Today the guest is super special. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.770
 ricardo almeida who understands everything from 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.690
 men's world of fashion will give tips 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.690
 important aspects of current tailoring 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.260
 luke tailoring 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 Let's start by pasting a message. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 There is something new about this good school. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 school and we made a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 When he's putting it on he gets 180 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.670
 degrees and straight nec on the shirt 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 there the knot of the tie in box below 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.940
 the north ends up getting better 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.400
 in my way of is the windsor knot that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.730
 The tie is there, I think. 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.530
 gives more refinement in this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.630
 collar here he is very straight that is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 a different thing people can be 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.149
 wearing a tie without a tie is me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 case things - your collar work 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.390
 most current way is modern is not cool 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 and the tie that taught that there is time to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 legal tip and aggravated 30 today the tie 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 more modern but more interesting where 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 he complied with her because of her 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.110
 be narrower and you can use a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.429
 little shorter one centimeter more 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.429
 short than the waistband 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.250
 and the jacket there the lapels of the jacket people 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.400
 has a narrowed one, does not work at all 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.590
 with the sleeves also the driest ene 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.440
 of the proof of law that we have 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.270
 to dedicate to this but do not thank my 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.970
 Daddy, to see that she's all right. 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.280
 narrow and now shirt greeting 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 here in the manga how much does it have to appear 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.030
 of shirt 1 has to appear nothing 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.410
 looking what we use the most is that he 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.210
 appear only when you bend your arm and 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.650
 goes up a bit like the jacket and 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.650
 appears the way shirt 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.380
 and now the last tip people is look at the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.180
 inside of the jacket shows market looks 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.120
 what a more limited thing people 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.420
 working with liners gives a contrast 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.000
 which gives morning glow a new idea 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.030
 always ends up leaving the clothes on a face 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.550
 new is and when you take the youtube jacket and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.459
 You 're going to take off your jacket. 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.840
 people are different things repairs 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.890
 that's a different thing man is very 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.110
 conservative 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.540
 So we have to get ourselves 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.870
 details is not even sometimes this is a 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.610
 black jacket but he has small 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.900
 that closely identifies 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.239
 this is mine 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.670
 it has a chess and also close to 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.980
 since there is who the man he loved 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.850
 it does not slow the year to get too much 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.850
 thinks 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:05.420
