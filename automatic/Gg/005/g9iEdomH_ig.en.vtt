Hi! This is Leslie Sack for expertvillage.com.
You can always visit my website at lesliesack.com.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:16.029
We are doing Salsa and this is the ladies
and men right turn; that means you have to

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.100
know which way is right. So hop turn to the
right; everybody turn to the right. That's

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.150
right. Okay. So what we are going to be doing
is from the basic step so we are doing a forwarding

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.910
back to basic; quick quick slow, quick quick
slow. So you are going to have three steps

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:48.079
to get all the way around just like this.
Okay for the men and the women, leaders and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.107
followers; as you are going forward, you are
going to turn around. The big trick you do

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:56.110
turning is you have to step on your foot first
and you are going to step on your left foot.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.700
Get your weight there and then you are going
to turn on that foot. Then you are going to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.430
step forward on your right foot and now you
are just going to do a little half turn. You

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.289
end with your left foot back. Okay. Try to
end with your feet together. This is really

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:24.219
hard. I can't even do it. So this is what
it looks like from this direction. I'm going

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.399
along doing my basic then I get a step forward.
I'm going to do a half turn, then a step forward

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.600
on my right foot and half turn and I'm done.
I finish my basic quick quick slow. So a little

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.619
bit faster it goes quick quick slow, quick
quick slow. Turn around. Just make sure you

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.190
are stepping every step. Step step step, quick
quick slow, from the follow right counting

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.190
in eights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 so I am counting
my so I'm turning on count 5. 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.190
5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7,8, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 1, 2,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.190
3, 4 keep your head up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8. What we are doing so we don't get dizzy

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:13.680
is you are going to look at your partner which
is what we call spotting. So I am going to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:32.310
look at my partner, I'm going to look, I turn
and I whip my head around, don't see anything

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.629
else in the room and then my shoulders come
around. So if I want to do more than one turn,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.510
I'm going to get dizzy.
