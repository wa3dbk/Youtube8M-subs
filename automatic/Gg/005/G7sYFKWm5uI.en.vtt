it<00:00:32.600> should<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.079> line<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:35.130> from<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it should have a line going from the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.530 
it should have a line going from the
tank<00:00:35.730> straight<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.800> black<00:00:38.129> has<00:00:38.540> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there's a clear hose it also comes up

there's a clear hose it also comes up
from<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> tank<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.680> goes<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> bulb<00:00:46.520> but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
from the tank and goes to the bulb but

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.000 
from the tank and goes to the bulb but
there's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> third<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.930> hidden<00:00:53.120> see<00:00:55.010> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there's a third one that's hidden see to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.049 
there's a third one that's hidden see to
find<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.109> like<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> cover<00:00:58.469> come<00:00:58.739> off<00:00:59.059> push

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
find it like to cover come off push

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.770 
find it like to cover come off push
gently<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:02.210> squeeze<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.449> thumb

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
gently here and squeeze with your thumb

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
gently here and squeeze with your thumb
so<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> slides<00:01:04.860> outward<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.880> basically

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
so that it slides outward and basically

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.190 
so that it slides outward and basically
a<00:01:09.240> flipped<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.260> remove<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> cover<00:01:12.200> just

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
a flipped little remove the cover just

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
a flipped little remove the cover just
get<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:17.060> third<00:01:18.060> fuel

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
get it out of the way and a third fuel

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.950 
get it out of the way and a third fuel
line<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:20.220> somewhat<00:01:21.090> visible<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
line is somewhat visible in there I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
line is somewhat visible in there I
don't<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
don't know if you can see it to the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
don't know if you can see it to the
right<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> shiny<00:01:25.159> label<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:27.409> fuel<00:01:28.409> line

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
right of the shiny label is a fuel line

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.580 
right of the shiny label is a fuel line
and<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:30.390> goes<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> left<00:01:31.229> side<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and it goes from the left side of the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.700 
and it goes from the left side of the
bulb<00:01:32.479> upward<00:01:34.040> into<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> side<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> carb

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
bulb upward into the side of the carb

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.840 
bulb upward into the side of the carb
that's<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.250> there

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that's it right there

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
that's it right there
probably<00:01:39.479> not<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> show<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.470> camera

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
probably not going to show up on camera

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
probably not going to show up on camera
with<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> hoop<00:01:41.869> especially<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:44.149> get

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
with the hoop especially when the get

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
with the hoop especially when the get
with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> camera<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.110> trying<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> point

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
with the camera is also trying to point

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.100 
with the camera is also trying to point
it<00:01:47.100> stuff

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
it stuff

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.359 
it stuff
anyway<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.799> third<00:01:50.130> line<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.700> hanging<00:01:51.060> off

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
anyway if that third line is hanging off

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
anyway if that third line is hanging off
you're<00:01:53.369> probably<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> remove<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you're probably going to remove the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
you're probably going to remove the
carburetor<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.399> paying<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
carburetor to get to it it's paying the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.620 
carburetor to get to it it's paying the
neck<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.619> problem<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> mine<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> they

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
neck the problem of mine was that they

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.580 
neck the problem of mine was that they
use<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.890> spring<00:02:01.890> inside<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.430> fuel<00:02:02.670> line<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.590> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
use a spring inside that fuel line is to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.280 
use a spring inside that fuel line is to
keep<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.040> line<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.640> collapsing<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
keep the line from collapsing but the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.639 
keep the line from collapsing but the
spring<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:07.680> too<00:02:07.860> long

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
spring was too long

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.149 
spring was too long
so<00:02:09.030> somebody<00:02:10.030> showed<00:02:10.329> the<00:02:11.110> fuel<00:02:11.530> line<00:02:11.709> on<00:02:11.950> at

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
so somebody showed the fuel line on at

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.119 
so somebody showed the fuel line on at
the<00:02:12.250> factory<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.360> spring<00:02:13.720> was<00:02:14.129> soon

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
the factory but that spring was soon

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.009 
the factory but that spring was soon
thereafter<00:02:15.310> pushed<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.299> fuel<00:02:16.599> line<00:02:16.780> right

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
thereafter pushed the fuel line right

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.330 
thereafter pushed the fuel line right
back<00:02:17.230> off<00:02:17.439> so<00:02:18.989> anyway<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.230> pulled<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.040> spring

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
back off so anyway I pulled the spring

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.270 
back off so anyway I pulled the spring
out<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> inside<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.209> fuel<00:02:22.420> line

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
out of the inside of that fuel line

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.360 
out of the inside of that fuel line
clipped<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.489> removed<00:02:24.939> about<00:02:25.150> 3/8<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.689> an<00:02:25.810> inch

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
clipped it removed about 3/8 of an inch

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.069 
clipped it removed about 3/8 of an inch
went<00:02:27.370> back<00:02:27.519> on<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.180> now<00:02:28.329> my<00:02:28.569> fuel<00:02:28.810> bulb

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
went back on and now my fuel bulb

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.229 
went back on and now my fuel bulb
actually<00:02:29.560> has<00:02:30.310> fuel<00:02:30.579> ended<00:02:30.879> up<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.209> I

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
actually has fuel ended up when I
