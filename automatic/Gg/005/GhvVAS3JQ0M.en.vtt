00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
 1 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.879
 the 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.579
 every day the dryer 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.389
 receives several internal requests from the South f that this be for products of 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.960
 health or hotel products 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.669
 to better manage these flows a traceability system throughout the 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.980
 supply chain was put in place 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.390
 for caregivers this new approach presents many 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.399
 advantages 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.399
 to the ease of allows to have a follow-up at the level of the expiry of 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.310
 products 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.960
 it allows to keep% of the stocks always enough provided at the level of 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.060
 material and after all have 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.620
 never worry about the references for ordering 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.310
 products in the end we spend less time in the cabinets and more time 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.310
 to kate's bed 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 traceability rationalizations are the watchwords of the platform 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160
 dijon supply italian 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.230
 here on 5000 square meters we receive labels by rejecting the stock and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.600
 redistributes according to precise standards more than 1500 references 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.240
 in my job every day 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 Orlane the internet platform 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 currently tracks training 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 and that on the other side expiry date 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.740
 products from the entrance of the platform to the exit 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 nor with transmission of this information of course software 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 trades and therefore a transmission to the potentially 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.410
 patient 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.600
 the goal is to be able to read small labels with all types 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.440
 of products 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.120
 of the care unit the corman type label on which there is a coach 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.250
 so many articles hate hate in polls the simple 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950
 which allow to pass 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.640
 a command to the platform 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 the order can be put in several bins which converge towards the dock 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.180
 shipping and are returned to the care unit with an address 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.820
 geographical 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.340
 delivery in the early morning at the eysÃ©e by a barcode so that allows 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 the arrival of power to make the link between them the delivery code is in 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.660
 makes a try stop it's also a little sport king 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.510
 and for android or iran why have the equivalent of a delivery notice 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.730
 all the support functions of 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:16.870
 10 points 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 like logistics or management while supplies 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.129
 what to be absolutely automated simplified 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.319
 and the hospital platform constitutes in this area a plus and for the 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.319
 caregivers 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.659
 it's a plus with the reminder indeed 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.689
 the plavix will have to fully set up in order to better measure the 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.969
 benefit of the platform in the same way the suppliers must also 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.189
 that playing the game ap it is not the best 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.150
 they are at home for the moment on the supplier side because we 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.809
 are in capacity 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:58.189
 delirious codification to retrieve information from shipping advice 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.799
 we are just waiting and excited to receive them from suppliers and 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.859
 that can even face it is a codification by logistic unit 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.589
 completely transparent story for us 4 the hospital platform 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.899
 supply is ready and marc a big step in the meeting 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.269
 of the hospitalized universe and the industrial universe 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.709
 embody in this project by famous actors like the group savoie 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.359
 jesse st and then consult her 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.100
 the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.560
 the generalization of plavix and the treatment of drugs are the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.860
 next challenges of the duceppe dijon platform 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 Why
