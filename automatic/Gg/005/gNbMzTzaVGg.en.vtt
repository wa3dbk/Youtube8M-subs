00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
the breadcrumbs and we're gonna melt
this<00:02:01.560> together<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.160> what<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.490> does<00:02:02.760> is<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this together and what this does is just

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.150 
this together and what this does is just
add<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.870> moisture<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.440> breadcrumbs<00:02:04.890> and

add some moisture to the breadcrumbs and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.740 
add some moisture to the breadcrumbs and
it<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.240> helps<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:07.260> produce<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
it really helps to produce a
golden-brown<00:02:09.750> crust<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> bake<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:12.110> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
golden-brown crust when you bake it and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.710 
golden-brown crust when you bake it and
to<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.800> add<00:02:14.720> Parmesan

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to this I'm going to add Parmesan

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.470 
to this I'm going to add Parmesan
Reggiano<00:02:15.870> cheese<00:02:16.730> now<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.300> add

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
Reggiano cheese now do this just to add

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.660 
Reggiano cheese now do this just to add
another<00:02:18.510> dimension<00:02:19.050> another<00:02:19.710> layer<00:02:20.370> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
another dimension another layer of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
flavor for the mac and cheese so it's

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.080 
flavor for the mac and cheese so it's
just<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.420> 1<00:02:24.690> 1<00:02:25.650> dimensional<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.670> topping

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
just not 1 1 dimensional this topping

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.620 
just not 1 1 dimensional this topping
gets<00:02:27.270> very<00:02:27.540> crunchy<00:02:27.810> when<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.170> bakes<00:02:29.630> just

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
gets very crunchy when it bakes just

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.860 
gets very crunchy when it bakes just
