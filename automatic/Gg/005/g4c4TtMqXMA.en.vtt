00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
together very nicely I think so hi sheep
with<00:01:42.240> anything<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> had<00:01:43.259> about<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
with anything when I had about the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.700 
with anything when I had about the
Fantastic<00:01:44.520> Four<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.030> felt<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.259> very

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Fantastic Four one I felt that it's very

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.050 
Fantastic Four one I felt that it's very
true<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> comic<00:01:47.340> books<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.909> what

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
true to the comic books and that's what

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
true to the comic books and that's what
I<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> mean<00:01:49.200> we've

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I like so much about it I mean we've

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
I like so much about it I mean we've
already<00:01:50.159> seen<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.790> many<00:01:50.909> uh<00:01:51.290> not<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.470> many

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
already seen so many uh not so many

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
already seen so many uh not so many
franchises<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.369> hopefully<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.090> start<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> see

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
franchises but hopefully we start to see

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.700 
franchises but hopefully we start to see
more<00:01:54.600> franchises<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> direction

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
more franchises go in that direction

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.300 
more franchises go in that direction
since<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.579> success<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> Avengers<00:01:57.570> was

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
since the success of the Avengers was

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
since the success of the Avengers was
really<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.820> combined<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.299> great<00:02:00.509> acting

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
really get combined to the great acting

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
really get combined to the great acting
with<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.009> story<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.000> little

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
with you know a story it was a little

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.080 
with you know a story it was a little
more<00:02:03.420> comic<00:02:03.810> booky<00:02:04.140> than<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> Nolan<00:02:04.770> films<00:02:05.100> so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
more comic booky than the Nolan films so
