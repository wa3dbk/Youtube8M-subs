about a month and two weeks after my
round<00:00:57.180> ended<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.410> gone<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.859> 117<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.859> 126

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
round ended I had gone from 117 to 126

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.190 
round ended I had gone from 117 to 126
or<00:01:02.100> 127<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.460> moved<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:05.909> 10<00:01:06.299> pounds<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
or 127 so I moved up about 10 pounds in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
or 127 so I moved up about 10 pounds in
those<00:01:07.380> six<00:01:07.680> weeks<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.670> majority<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
those six weeks which the majority of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.469 
those six weeks which the majority of
which<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> clarify<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
which just to clarify was actually just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990 
which just to clarify was actually just
muscle<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> glycogen<00:01:13.770> stores<00:01:14.220> 3<00:01:14.640> filling

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
muscle and glycogen stores 3 filling

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.440 
muscle and glycogen stores 3 filling
because<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.890> p2<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.549> round<00:01:17.729> 5<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> didn't<00:01:18.360> eat

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because on my p2 in round 5 I didn't eat

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
because on my p2 in round 5 I didn't eat
any<00:01:18.659> fruit<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.790> diet<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> very

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
any fruit at all so the diet was a very

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.859 
any fruit at all so the diet was a very
low<00:01:21.900> carb<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.310> um<00:01:24.080> my<00:01:25.080> weight<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.560> kind<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
low carb so um my weight was kind of

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
low carb so um my weight was kind of
superficially<00:01:27.869> low<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.100> glycogen

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
superficially low because my glycogen

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.210 
superficially low because my glycogen
stores<00:01:30.000> were<00:01:30.270> low<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.070> know

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
stores were low and so all that you know

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.179 
stores were low and so all that you know
how<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> refill<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> stabilized

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
how to refill up so so I stabilized

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.810 
how to refill up so so I stabilized
around<00:01:35.810> 126<00:01:36.810> 127<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.950> I've<00:01:38.189> been<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
around 126 127 and I've been that for

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
around 126 127 and I've been that for
over<00:01:39.119> two<00:01:39.299> months<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.110> my<00:01:40.650> weight<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

very<00:01:41.310> stable<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.470> by<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> mean<00:01:44.280> I'm

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
very stable there and by that I mean I'm

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
very stable there and by that I mean I'm
not<00:01:45.149> eating<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> low-carb<00:01:45.960> diet<00:01:46.229> anymore<00:01:47.070> I

legs my body just feels even firmer I
kind<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.420> would<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:31.959> another<00:03:31.989> hydro

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.289 
kind of would like to have another hydro
static<00:03:33.040> test<00:03:33.280> done<00:03:33.489> just<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> see<00:03:34.060> where<00:03:34.209> I'm

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
static test done just to see where I'm

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.960 
static test done just to see where I'm
at<00:03:34.450> because<00:03:35.069> even<00:03:36.069> though<00:03:36.160> my<00:03:36.310> weight<00:03:36.579> is<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
at because even though my weight is the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.440 
at because even though my weight is the
same<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.540> almost<00:03:37.750> feel<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> little<00:03:38.590> bit<00:03:39.450> tighter

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
same I almost feel a little bit tighter

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.979 
same I almost feel a little bit tighter
um<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.769> I'm<00:03:41.829> almost<00:03:42.010> curious<00:03:42.549> actually<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.810> see

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
um so I'm almost curious actually to see

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.960 
um so I'm almost curious actually to see
if<00:03:44.170> I<00:03:44.350> gained<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.220> little<00:03:45.310> more<00:03:45.549> muscle<00:03:45.910> and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
if I gained a little more muscle and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.030 
if I gained a little more muscle and
lost<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.420> little<00:03:46.660> fat<00:03:46.810> possibly<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.530> kind<00:03:47.980> of

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
lost a little fat possibly I kind of

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.110 
lost a little fat possibly I kind of
find<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.310> hard<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.519> believe<00:03:48.609> because<00:03:48.790> I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
find that hard to believe because I

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.809 
find that hard to believe because I
never<00:03:49.420> lose<00:03:49.600> fat<00:03:49.900> off<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:50.260> HCG<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:50.980> I'm<00:03:51.579> just

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
never lose fat off of HCG but I'm just

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.259 
never lose fat off of HCG but I'm just
kind<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.090> curious<00:03:52.209> about<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.950> anyway<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.269> yeah

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
kind of curious about it anyway so yeah

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.129 
kind of curious about it anyway so yeah
so<00:03:55.569> I'm<00:03:55.690> doing<00:03:55.870> really<00:03:56.079> good<00:03:56.230> um<00:03:57.959> yeah<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:58.989> don't

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
so I'm doing really good um yeah I don't

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.720 
so I'm doing really good um yeah I don't
really<00:03:59.380> have<00:03:59.530> anything<00:03:59.709> exciting<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.519> share

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
really have anything exciting to share

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.670 
really have anything exciting to share
but<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.359> just<00:04:01.660> thought<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.019> know<00:04:02.049> everyone

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
but I just thought you know everyone

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.170 
but I just thought you know everyone
wants<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.040> sometimes<00:04:03.579> how<00:04:03.790> people<00:04:04.090> are

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
wants to know sometimes how people are

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.990 
wants to know sometimes how people are

adrenal conditions what I'm doing right

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.960 
adrenal conditions what I'm doing right
now<00:04:29.170> is<00:04:29.500> I'm<00:04:29.680> actually<00:04:29.890> taking<00:04:30.520> my<00:04:30.700> thyroid

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
medication I take sytem lt3 I actually

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.620 
medication I take sytem lt3 I actually
take<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.410> at<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.070> 5:00<00:04:36.520> in<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.910> morning<00:04:37.030> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
take that at like 5:00 in the morning I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.110 
take that at like 5:00 in the morning I
have<00:04:38.350> said<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> little<00:04:38.920> vibrational<00:04:39.580> alarm<00:04:39.910> for

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
have said a little vibrational alarm for

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.570 
have said a little vibrational alarm for
myself<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.380> take<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.800> at<00:04:41.980> that<00:04:42.190> time<00:04:42.400> and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
myself and I take it at that time and

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.940 
myself and I take it at that time and
then<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.760> just<00:04:42.940> go<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.240> sleep<00:04:43.660> um<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.770> it's

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
then I just go back to sleep um and it's

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.240 
then I just go back to sleep um and it's
25<00:04:45.430> micrograms<00:04:45.790> I'm<00:04:46.240> taking<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:47.250> apparently

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
25 micrograms I'm taking and apparently

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.820 
25 micrograms I'm taking and apparently
I<00:04:48.370> read<00:04:49.360> about<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.900> book<00:04:50.050> actually<00:04:50.650> by

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
I read about this in a book actually by

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.170 
I read about this in a book actually by
Paul<00:04:51.130> Robinson<00:04:51.610> called<00:04:52.210> recovery<00:04:52.690> with<00:04:53.110> t3

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
Paul Robinson called recovery with t3

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.590 
Paul Robinson called recovery with t3
and<00:04:55.920> basically<00:04:56.920> what<00:04:57.310> it's<00:04:57.460> about<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:58.180> for

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
and basically what it's about is for

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.560 
and basically what it's about is for
those<00:04:58.780> who<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:59.080> adrenal<00:04:59.770> fatigue<00:05:00.570> taking

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
those who have adrenal fatigue taking

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.870 
those who have adrenal fatigue taking
some<00:05:02.170> of<00:05:02.200> your<00:05:02.470> thyroid<00:05:02.860> medication<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.700> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
some of your thyroid medication in the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.640 
some of your thyroid medication in the
wee<00:05:04.090> hours<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.690> morning<00:05:04.780> like<00:05:05.290> between

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
wee hours in the morning like between

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.430 
wee hours in the morning like between
4:00<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.100> 5:00<00:05:06.430> or<00:05:06.730> 6:00<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.120> morning

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
4:00 and 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.360 
4:00 and 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning
apparently<00:05:08.440> that's<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.770> time<00:05:09.070> when<00:05:09.250> your

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
apparently that's the time when your

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.180 
apparently that's the time when your
body<00:05:09.610> produces<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.450> most<00:05:10.630> cortisol<00:05:11.260> so<00:05:12.010> by

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
body produces the most cortisol so by

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.770 
body produces the most cortisol so by
taking<00:05:12.400> your<00:05:12.670> thyroid<00:05:13.090> medication<00:05:13.690> it

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
taking your thyroid medication it

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.660 
taking your thyroid medication it
actually<00:05:14.170> helps<00:05:14.470> drive<00:05:14.740> your<00:05:15.010> adrenals<00:05:15.460> in<00:05:15.610> a

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
actually helps drive your adrenals in a

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.880 
actually helps drive your adrenals in a
healthy<00:05:16.120> way<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:17.110> produce<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.680> right<00:05:17.830> amount

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
healthy way to produce the right amount

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.460 
healthy way to produce the right amount
of<00:05:18.250> cortisol<00:05:18.700> at<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.030> right<00:05:19.300> time<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.840> day<00:05:19.870> and

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
of cortisol at the right time of day and

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.130 
of cortisol at the right time of day and
I<00:05:21.220> actually<00:05:21.880> started<00:05:22.270> doing<00:05:22.600> this<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.900> believe

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
I actually started doing this I believe

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.860 
I actually started doing this I believe
about<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.770> month<00:05:24.100> ago<00:05:24.250> now<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:25.030> I've

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
about a month ago now and I've

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.480 
about a month ago now and I've
definitely<00:05:26.140> been<00:05:26.470> feeling<00:05:26.830> quite<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.250> bit

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
definitely been feeling quite a bit

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.240 
definitely been feeling quite a bit
better<00:05:27.640> than<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:28.120> was<00:05:28.390> so<00:05:29.230> that's<00:05:29.770> been<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.100> nice

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
better than I was so that's been a nice

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.250 
better than I was so that's been a nice
thing<00:05:30.700> most<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.480> stuff<00:05:31.690> I'd<00:05:31.840> tried<00:05:32.110> never

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
thing most of the stuff I'd tried never

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.920 
thing most of the stuff I'd tried never
seems<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.770> last<00:05:33.130> for<00:05:33.460> too<00:05:33.610> long<00:05:33.790> but<00:05:34.210> for<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
seems to last for too long but for the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.810 
seems to last for too long but for the
moment<00:05:35.140> um<00:05:35.560> it's<00:05:36.010> definitely<00:05:36.220> making<00:05:36.640> me

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
moment um it's definitely making me

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.990 
moment um it's definitely making me
better<00:05:37.030> enough<00:05:37.390> that<00:05:37.720> I'm<00:05:37.900> able<00:05:38.140> to<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.880> know

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
better enough that I'm able to you know

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.460 
better enough that I'm able to you know
do<00:05:40.210> all<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.480> basic<00:05:40.810> things<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.170> need<00:05:41.350> to
