making<00:00:00.989> bread<00:00:01.199> often<00:00:01.500> calls<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> yeast

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
making bread often calls for a yeast

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.640 
making bread often calls for a yeast
sponge<00:00:02.939> which<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.419> basically<00:00:03.870> mixing<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.500> wet

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
sponge which is basically mixing the wet

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.440 
sponge which is basically mixing the wet
ingredients<00:00:04.859> plus<00:00:05.520> yeast<00:00:05.910> into<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.299> bit<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
ingredients plus yeast into a bit of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.960 
ingredients plus yeast into a bit of
flour<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:07.620> feeds<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.189> yeast<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.670> gives<00:00:08.849> it

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
flour this feeds the yeast and gives it

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.580 
flour this feeds the yeast and gives it
a<00:00:09.030> chance<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.389> rise<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.900> before<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.410> actually

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
a chance to rise up before you actually

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.499 
a chance to rise up before you actually
need<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> dough<00:00:11.400> out<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> put<00:00:12.120> your<00:00:12.269> last

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
need the dough out and put your last

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.650 
need the dough out and put your last
ingredients<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.360> milk

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
ingredients in it so in here I have milk

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.500 
ingredients in it so in here I have milk
and<00:00:15.900> two<00:00:16.379> teaspoons<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.039> yeast<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.550> I've

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and two teaspoons of yeast and I've

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.210 
and two teaspoons of yeast and I've
warmed<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> milk<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.380> room<00:00:19.560> temperature<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
warmed the milk to room temperature and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
warmed the milk to room temperature and
sprinkle<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> yeast<00:00:20.939> over<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> top<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sprinkle the yeast over the top and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
sprinkle the yeast over the top and
mixed<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.760> it's<00:00:23.760> been<00:00:23.939> sitting<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.240> about

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
mixed it on it's been sitting for about

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
mixed it on it's been sitting for about
ten<00:00:24.750> minutes<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.230> its<00:00:25.380> frost<00:00:25.650> off<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> got<00:00:26.310> all

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
ten minutes in its frost off and got all

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
ten minutes in its frost off and got all
foamy<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:26.880> nice<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.570> used<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> happy

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
foamy and nice and they used to happy

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
foamy and nice and they used to happy
and<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:29.189> I'm<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> turn<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and now I'm going to turn them into a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
and now I'm going to turn them into a
yeast<00:00:30.750> sponge<00:00:32.780> okay<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.770> make<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> well<00:00:35.309> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
yeast sponge okay so we make a well in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
yeast sponge okay so we make a well in
the<00:00:35.579> center<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> flour

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the center of the flour

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.830 
the center of the flour
I've<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.899> 500<00:00:37.170> grams<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.860> flour<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
I've got 500 grams of flour there and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.729 
I've got 500 grams of flour there and
pour<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> wet<00:00:41.040> yeast<00:00:41.520> mixture<00:00:44.960> then<00:00:45.960> make

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
pour in the wet yeast mixture then make

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.470 
pour in the wet yeast mixture then make
some<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.280> enough<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> flour<00:00:48.210> from

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
some just enough of the flour from

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.270 
some just enough of the flour from
around<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> edges<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> paste

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
around the edges to make a kind of paste

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.680 
around the edges to make a kind of paste
don't<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:54.000> wet<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
don't want it to be too wet and you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.729 
don't want it to be too wet and you
don't<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.770> dry<00:01:00.350> as<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
don't want it to be too dry as you can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.840 
don't want it to be too dry as you can
see<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.399> nice<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.670> pasty<00:01:03.329> now

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
require a yeast mixture and any of these
can<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.479> turned<00:01:18.689> into<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> yeast<00:01:19.259> sponge<00:01:19.710> which

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
can be turned into a yeast sponge which

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
can be turned into a yeast sponge which
has<00:01:20.130> always<00:01:20.460> beneficial<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> rising<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> a

bread some yeast mixtures involve water

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.080

or<00:01:25.680> honey<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.640> happens<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
or honey this one just happens to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
or honey this one just happens to
involve<00:01:27.330> milk<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.409> usually<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.950> wet

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
involve milk but it's usually the wet

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
involve milk but it's usually the wet
ingredients<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> mix<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> use

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
ingredients that you mix would you use

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
ingredients that you mix would you use
to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> started<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.979> most<00:01:32.159> important

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to get it started the most important

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
to get it started the most important
thing<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.360> must<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.750> too<00:01:34.049> hot<00:01:34.259> or

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
thing about it is it must be too hot or

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
thing about it is it must be too hot or
too<00:01:34.619> cold<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.400> kill<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:35.820> yeast

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
too cold or you will kill your yeast

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.280 
too cold or you will kill your yeast
they<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.590> alive<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:38.939> little

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
they are actually alive they're little

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.149 
they are actually alive they're little
microorganisms<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.470> they're<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.740> cute

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
microorganisms and they're a bit cute

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
microorganisms and they're a bit cute
really<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> kill<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
really but if you kill them then they

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
really but if you kill them then they
won't<00:01:43.229> rise<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.860> bread<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.549> yeast<00:01:44.850> has

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
won't rise in your bread the yeast has

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
won't rise in your bread the yeast has
sponged<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.720> 25<00:01:46.320> minutes<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.070> hopefully<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
sponged for 25 minutes and hopefully is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
sponged for 25 minutes and hopefully is
now<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.329> risen<00:01:50.210> look<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.780> nice<00:01:52.350> risen

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
now all risen look at that a nice risen

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
now all risen look at that a nice risen
yeast<00:01:53.250> sponge<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.869> mix<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.350> any

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
yeast sponge and you can now mix in any

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
yeast sponge and you can now mix in any
other<00:01:55.799> ingredients<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.119> one
