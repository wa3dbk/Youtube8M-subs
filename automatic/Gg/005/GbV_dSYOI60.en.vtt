00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello dear comrades and friends and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.429
 Today we will have a rating of the most 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.349
 terrible tanks in the game world of tanks 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.910
 Well, of course it will not rating a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.180
 just a video with five tanks where I 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.550
 I will tell about all their minuses and maybe 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.550
 even a plus 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.539
 this is nonsense 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.379
 drinking up to 1 10 and 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:49.070
 First I would like to tell you about the tank 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.219
 t-34 3 is a straight machine of the eighth level 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.030
 right from t i would even say so what's 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.969
 you ask him something bad 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.239
 constantly explodes with him constantly 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.539
 burns and constantly criticized tank 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.630
 and yes and the most important minus he has neither 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:12.380
 why the hell the gun doesn't fall that's why 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.420
 given so bad tekke yes of course you 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
 say he cracks down on his 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.130
 the main task he farms nobody 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.069
 arguing but why do we need such a straight 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.799
 a machine that farms from which we have 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.619
 will constantly blaze take better 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.069
 t-34 there you will constantly farm and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.409
 bend right there you'll farm but 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.750
 you will blaze so this tanchik 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.600
 get into this video let's go to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.119
 next machine and next machine 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 us too with the machine you guys 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.820
 imagine straight machine su-85 and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:54.140
 This Fri-Scale was introduced in patch 090 and 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.479
 not advertised in any way 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.780
 developers can see it 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.020
 understood that not for shit enters and how to 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.570
 it will be bad for you to play therefore 185 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.359
 same here gets only three 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 reasons the first reason is him 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.030
 crappy compared to other straight 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.640
 cars of the fifth level 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.220
 the second reason is it to meddle and the third 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780
 his breakthrough so given of course 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.120
 still speed fourth reason yes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.269
 so this machine is also here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 falls and you will suffer on it and 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.120
 wasps will flare up too 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.549
 next car and the next car as 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 this is not strange t95 you say at t95 2 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.769
 ohrenitelnoy gun first stock 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.660
 which has a good recharge and 2 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.360
 top which has good 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.570
 damage yes I do not argue all right you are right 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.970
 guys but you understand on t95 you either 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.430
 have time to inflict damage if enemies 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 attack you there in the assault when you 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.350
 defend yourself either in standard combat when 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.250
 you too your team merges and you 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.710
 defend yourself either you are going to attack and neither 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.830
 do not have time to do such a thing 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.380
 games on t95 and with this you have nothing 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.210
 so on t95 you will do too 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.090
 blaze in both direct and portable 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.810
 sense you'll be the smartest goal for 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.030
 arts and nothing can be done about it until 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.740
 add speed radius 5 and this i 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 I think I will never do it because 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.610
 I think the storm said that T95 oppression but 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.430
 oppression oppression we move on and on 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.390
 We are going to the mouse, which also bends to wash 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.210
 According to Cat 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.140
 but this is a peculiar opinion because 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.810
 Mouse once bent but now abundance 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.100
 art even after nerf he ain't 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.480
 oppression he garena I'm an old gun he 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.730
 ohrenet how much armor for this he 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.010
 slow yes of course he can tank 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 his armor but art will punish us 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.540
 and modern tanks with him bans inbal and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.510
 modern tanks with an ebanut breakout 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.000
 they will punish us too 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.700
 also included with mouse 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.740
 you will most likely even burn 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.290
 not only from the mouse from that technique 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.570
 which stands in the pumping branch as 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.080
 mouse so the mouse I also do not 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.440
 would recommend the last tank today 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.810
 it and they x 40 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.180
 Well, then say something unnecessarily necessary for 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.360
 him a couple of times to go and you will understand 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.950
 mx 40 is a light tank and light but 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.690
 only when to her from a hill yes it 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.390
 a kind of light tank because with 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.080
 slides he can develop 42 now so 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.910
 does he ride very slowly yes he has 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.280
 more or less good armor more or less 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.450
 Good fugasnit which can and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.900
 shoot cumulative but it's not that 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.750
 on it you will suffer and and everything on 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.990
 in fact everyone is hiring you suffer 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.530
 so swing it for freedom either 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.840
 do not download music on this perhaps 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.729

 bend write those tanks that you 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.229
 consider superfluous in this list or those 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.740
 tanks that were supposed to get into this 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.750
 list 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.280
