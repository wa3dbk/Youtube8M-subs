00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
and that's that so almost on the second

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.480 
and that's that so almost on the second
bag<00:00:47.890> or<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.130> set<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.940> also<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.630> full<00:00:50.900> bag

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
bag or the set and also in the full bag

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.960 
bag or the set and also in the full bag
you<00:00:52.490> give<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.390> two<00:00:53.660> blocks<00:00:54.160> for<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.960> sides
