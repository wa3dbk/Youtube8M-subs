do some DDoS attacks which it sounds
very<00:00:22.109> sophisticated<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.430> basically<00:00:24.150> they

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
very sophisticated but basically they

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.320 
very sophisticated but basically they
just<00:00:24.359> overload<00:00:25.080> these<00:00:25.320> these<00:00:25.949> servers<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
just overload these these servers to the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990 
just overload these these servers to the
point<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.890> they<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:28.949> denied<00:00:29.429> service

point where they get denied service
that's<00:00:30.240> basically<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.689> means<00:00:30.779> denial<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that's basically what it means denial of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.770 
that's basically what it means denial of
service<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:33.000> took<00:00:33.210> down<00:00:33.239> ea's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
service so on they took down ea's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.920 
service so on they took down ea's
website<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:35.399> took<00:00:35.640> down<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.270> League<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
website they took down the League of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.850 
website they took down the League of
Legends<00:00:37.410> servers<00:00:38.570> they<00:00:39.570> did<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.200> today<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
Legends servers they did a lot today and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
Legends servers they did a lot today and
this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> probably<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.450> time<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this is probably not the first time I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
this is probably not the first time I
haven't<00:00:43.770> looked<00:00:43.980> into<00:00:44.190> their<00:00:44.460> past<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:45.329> much

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.880 
haven't looked into their past very much
because<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> give<00:00:46.440> them<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> lot

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
because I don't want to give them a lot

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.930 
because I don't want to give them a lot
of<00:00:47.010> credence<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.190> basically<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.820> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of credence so basically this is what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
of credence so basically this is what
they've<00:00:51.270> done<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.219> at<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
kind of go off on my own because there's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170

there's no reason behind it and there's
definitely<00:01:27.780> people<00:01:28.259> doing<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> who<00:01:29.100> have

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

talents with computers and not the DDoS
attacks<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> hardest<00:01:32.939> things<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.509> but

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
attacks are the hardest things to do but

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.590 
attacks are the hardest things to do but
it<00:01:34.799> does<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> effort<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
it does take a little bit of effort a
little<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> time<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:38.009> people

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
little bit of time that these people

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
little bit of time that these people
could<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> using<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.119> create<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:39.780> own

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
could be using to create their own

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
could be using to create their own
website<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:41.009> something<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.790> wear
