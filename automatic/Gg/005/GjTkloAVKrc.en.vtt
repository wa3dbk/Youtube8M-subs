00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you're saying this isn't unusual because

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
you're saying this isn't unusual because
when<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> picture<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.840> say<00:00:34.050> oh

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
when I see a picture like this I say oh

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.440 
when I see a picture like this I say oh
this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.950> bizarre

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
this is so bizarre

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
this is so bizarre
it<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> mean<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.800> may<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.100> more

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
it is I mean I think it's it may be more

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.920 
it is I mean I think it's it may be more
common<00:00:38.730> than<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.329> certainly<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
common than we think certainly in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
common than we think certainly in
captive<00:00:40.379> situations<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.610> quite<00:00:41.940> as

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
captive situations it's not quite as

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.580 
captive situations it's not quite as
surprising<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> does<00:00:43.110> happen<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
surprising but it does happen in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
surprising but it does happen in the
wild<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.510> animals

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
wild it was is it because the animals

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360 
wild it was is it because the animals
imprinting<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.500> another<00:00:46.800> animal<00:00:47.190> very

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
imprinting on another animal very

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.560 
imprinting on another animal very
because<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> lot<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> these<00:00:47.969> pictures<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.329> from

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
because a lot of these pictures are from

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
because a lot of these pictures are from
one<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> animals<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.920> baby

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
one of the animals is a little baby

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
one of the animals is a little baby
right<00:00:50.460> sometimes<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> case<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.050> think

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
right sometimes that is the case I think

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
right sometimes that is the case I think
the<00:00:52.289> context<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> important<00:00:53.430> sometimes

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the context is important sometimes

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.610 
the context is important sometimes
there's<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.629> animal<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.050> lost<00:00:55.230> its<00:00:55.469> mother

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
there's an animal that's lost its mother

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
there's an animal that's lost its mother
or<00:00:55.890> lost<00:00:56.070> its<00:00:56.280> baby<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.239> seems<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
or lost its baby and it seems to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720 
or lost its baby and it seems to
instinctively<00:00:58.379> need<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.129> companionship

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
instinctively need the companionship

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
instinctively need the companionship
that<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.390> gotten<00:01:01.190> let's<00:01:02.190> take<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that it would have gotten let's take a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
that it would have gotten let's take a
look<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.180> saw<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> little

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
look at this one we saw this little

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.030 
look at this one we saw this little
earlier<00:01:05.299> it's<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.780> favorite<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.740> favorite

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
earlier it's not my favorite my favorite

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
earlier it's not my favorite my favorite
is<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> next<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> most

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is the next one but this was the most

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
is the next one but this was the most
unusual<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> brings<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
unusual to me because it brings me to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
unusual to me because it brings me to
the<00:01:11.159> question<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.580> why<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> these<00:01:13.080> things

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the question of why one of these things

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.359 
the question of why one of these things
that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.619> guess<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.920> because<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that I guess it's because they're in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.590 
that I guess it's because they're in
captivity<00:01:14.520> they're<00:01:14.939> not<00:01:15.030> wild<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.479> they're

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
captivity they're not wild so they're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.940 
captivity they're not wild so they're
not<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.720> eating<00:01:16.080> everything<00:01:16.439> alive<00:01:16.710> around

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
not just eating everything alive around

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
not just eating everything alive around
them<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> does<00:01:17.939> seem<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> little

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
them right but it does seem a little

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.679 
them right but it does seem a little
weird<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> gorilla<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> kitten<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
weird that a gorilla in a kitten or a
