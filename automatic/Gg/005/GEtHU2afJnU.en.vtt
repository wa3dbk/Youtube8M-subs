think about the football helmets the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
think about the football helmets the
better<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.530> protect<00:01:16.950> players<00:01:17.189> heads

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and the more they might use their heads

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
and the more they might use their heads
as<00:01:21.240> weapons<00:01:21.689> given<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.380> protected<00:01:23.040> they
