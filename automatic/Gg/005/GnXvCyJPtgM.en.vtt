maneuverability you get with an
oversized<00:01:44.549> frame<00:01:44.969> but<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.779> racket<00:01:46.200> actually

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
oversized frame but this racket actually

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.769 
oversized frame but this racket actually
proved<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.009> pretty<00:01:47.279> mobile<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.270> wasn't<00:01:48.630> bad

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:48.779 
proved to be pretty mobile it wasn't bad

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:50.389 
proved to be pretty mobile it wasn't bad
for<00:01:49.049> quick<00:01:49.259> shots<00:01:49.529> at<00:01:49.709> the<00:01:49.829> net<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.219> for

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
for quick shots at the net and for

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.490 
for quick shots at the net and for
adding<00:01:50.700> spin<00:01:50.969> at<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> bay

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
adding spin at the bay

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.130 
adding spin at the bay
I<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:52.580> also<00:01:53.000> surprised<00:01:53.420> by<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.660> level<00:01:54.050> of

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
I was also surprised by the level of

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.740 
I was also surprised by the level of
control<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.740> got<00:01:54.920> with<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.190> radical<00:01:55.610> OS<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.570> it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
control I got with the radical OS and it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.820 
control I got with the radical OS and it
turned<00:01:56.930> out<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.110> be<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> pretty<00:01:57.650> good

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
turned out to be a pretty good

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.430 
turned out to be a pretty good
all-around<00:01:58.130> racket<00:01:58.930> overall<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.170> would<00:02:00.320> be

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
all-around racket overall this would be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.900 
all-around racket overall this would be
a<00:02:00.470> great<00:02:00.800> choice<00:02:01.070> for<00:02:01.430> an<00:02:01.490> intermediate

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
a great choice for an intermediate

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.719 
a great choice for an intermediate
player<00:02:02.360> looking<00:02:02.900> for<00:02:03.110> control<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.800> feel<00:02:04.100> with

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
player looking for control and feel with

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.120 
player looking for control and feel with
enough<00:02:05.000> maneuverability<00:02:05.900> for<00:02:05.930> spin<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.830> a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
enough maneuverability for spin and a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.310 
enough maneuverability for spin and a
little<00:02:07.430> added<00:02:07.610> power<00:02:07.940> one<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> few

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
little added power one of the few

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.290 
little added power one of the few
control<00:02:09.740> oriented<00:02:10.070> oversized<00:02:10.700> frames<00:02:11.030> still

control oriented oversized frames still
around<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:11.930> was<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> bit<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.500> an<00:02:12.590> adjustment

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
around this was a bit of an adjustment

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.160 
around this was a bit of an adjustment
for<00:02:13.220> my<00:02:13.340> backhand<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:14.390> took<00:02:14.570> some<00:02:14.750> time<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:14.959> me

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
for my backhand it took some time for me

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.540 
for my backhand it took some time for me
to<00:02:15.290> get<00:02:15.440> used<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.770> hitting<00:02:15.920> with<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.190> larger

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.490 
to get used to hitting with the larger
headset<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.330> once<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.660> did<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> enjoyed<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
headset but once I did I enjoyed the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.230 
headset but once I did I enjoyed the
extra<00:02:18.709> forgiveness<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.370> had<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.880> forehand

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
extra forgiveness I had on the forehand

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.540 
extra forgiveness I had on the forehand
side<00:02:20.440> even<00:02:21.440> though<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.650> was<00:02:21.860> maneuverable<00:02:22.430> at

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
side even though it was maneuverable at

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.100 
side even though it was maneuverable at
the<00:02:22.640> net<00:02:22.820> I<00:02:23.000> had<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.360> trouble<00:02:23.660> hitting<00:02:23.840> touch

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the net I had some trouble hitting touch

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.780 
the net I had some trouble hitting touch
volleys<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.890> string<00:02:25.130> bed<00:02:25.280> felt<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.640> little

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
volleys as the string bed felt a little

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.060 
volleys as the string bed felt a little
too<00:02:26.060> lively<00:02:26.510> for<00:02:27.320> me<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.560> racquet<00:02:27.920> worked

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
too lively for me this racquet worked

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.320 
too lively for me this racquet worked
best<00:02:28.340> from<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.610> baseline<00:02:28.940> playing

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
best from the baseline playing

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.270 
best from the baseline playing
aggressive<00:02:29.750> groundstrokes<00:02:30.410> on<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.800> serve<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
aggressive groundstrokes on the serve I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.130 
aggressive groundstrokes on the serve I
was<00:02:31.489> able<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> lot<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.300> spin<00:02:32.540> but<00:02:33.020> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
was able to get a lot of spin but the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.540 
was able to get a lot of spin but the
pace<00:02:33.320> suffered<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.800> bit<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.190> had<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> make

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
pace suffered a bit and I had to make

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.040 
pace suffered a bit and I had to make
some<00:02:34.730> adjustments<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.360> start<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> point<00:02:35.930> on

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
some adjustments to start the point on

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.410 
some adjustments to start the point on
the<00:02:36.140> offense<00:02:36.730> overall<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.760> really<00:02:38.000> liked<00:02:38.300> this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the offense overall I really liked this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.449 
the offense overall I really liked this
frame<00:02:38.660> for<00:02:38.840> my<00:02:38.900> groundstrokes<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.220> lacked

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
frame for my groundstrokes but it lacked

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.100 
frame for my groundstrokes but it lacked
the<00:02:40.610> feel<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.150> adjustment<00:02:41.630> at<00:02:41.720> net<00:02:41.900> gave

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the feel and the adjustment at net gave

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.479 
the feel and the adjustment at net gave
me<00:02:42.230> some<00:02:42.380> trouble<00:02:42.590> when<00:02:42.860> moving<00:02:43.070> into<00:02:43.400> the
