so<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.700> example<00:00:11.790> one<00:00:12.269> matter<00:00:12.540> or<00:00:13.049> add<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> rummy

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
so for example one matter or add a rummy

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
so for example one matter or add a rummy
so<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.250> very<00:00:14.490> easy<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.150> profit<00:00:15.630> I'm

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
so it's very easy to make profit I'm

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.710 
so it's very easy to make profit I'm
newly<00:00:16.289> released<00:00:16.890> transferred<00:00:17.699> tears<00:00:17.970> however

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
newly released transferred tears however

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.630 
newly released transferred tears however
their<00:00:18.930> profit<00:00:19.439> sorry<00:00:19.710> their<00:00:19.890> price<00:00:20.220> goes<00:00:20.609> down

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

rapidly<00:00:21.420> every<00:00:22.109> single<00:00:22.380> hour<00:00:22.769> because<00:00:23.580> people

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
rapidly every single hour because people

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
rapidly every single hour because people
are<00:00:24.060> packing<00:00:24.510> them<00:00:24.689> left<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.500> center

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
are packing them left right center

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.740 
are packing them left right center
impacts<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.910> example<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.480> matter

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
impacts with for example one matter

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.650 
impacts with for example one matter
might<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.070> 300<00:00:29.670> k<00:00:29.820> today<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
might go for about 300 k today but

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
might go for about 300 k today but
tomorrow<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.109> price<00:00:31.380> might<00:00:31.590> drop<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> 250<00:00:32.460> case

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
tomorrow is price might drop to 250 case

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
tomorrow is price might drop to 250 case
something<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.410> doing<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
something like that so when doing this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370 
something like that so when doing this
method<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.460> recommend<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.170> high

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
method I recommend not going with high

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
method I recommend not going with high
price<00:00:37.739> players<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.399> their<00:00:38.550> prices<00:00:38.940> will

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
price players because their prices will

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
price players because their prices will
drop<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.750> quickly<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.620> over<00:00:40.649> players<00:00:40.950> go

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
drop really quickly go over players go

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
drop really quickly go over players go
for<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.610> 20<00:00:42.030> k<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> 10k<00:00:43.230> something<00:00:43.620> like

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
for about 20 k and 10k something like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.459 
for about 20 k and 10k something like
that<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.399> example<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.149> matic<00:00:46.020> who

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that so a good example is matic who

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.350 
that so a good example is matic who
recently<00:00:46.739> transferred<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.579> benfica<00:00:48.090> i

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
recently transferred from benfica i

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
see how high it goes for I'd say go for

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
see how high it goes for I'd say go for
about<00:01:15.299> 12<00:01:15.659> k<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.080> maybe<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.640> if<00:01:17.640> its

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
about 12 k now maybe a bit more if its

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.929 
about 12 k now maybe a bit more if its
price<00:01:18.000> per<00:01:18.210> bit<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.930> 12k<00:01:19.670> right<00:01:20.670> first

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
price per bit not more 12k right first

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
price per bit not more 12k right first
up<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.689> don't--there's<00:01:22.020> number<00:01:22.439> 4<00:01:22.590> 12

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
up for that i don't--there's number 4 12

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
up for that i don't--there's number 4 12
k<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.970> i'm<00:01:24.119> lost<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.780> price<00:01:24.990> which

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
k so what if i'm lost by our price which

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
k so what if i'm lost by our price which
should<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.470> quite<00:01:25.680> easy<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
should be quite easy you want to go and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
should be quite easy you want to go and
basically<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.200> much<00:01:28.320> an<00:01:28.470> open<00:01:28.619> bid

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
basically it's pretty much an open bid

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
basically it's pretty much an open bid
method<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.700> sometimes<00:01:30.180> maybe<00:01:30.540> look<00:01:30.840> enough

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
method but sometimes maybe look enough

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
method but sometimes maybe look enough
to<00:01:31.650> find<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> few<00:01:32.159> messages<00:01:32.790> economics<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to find a few messages economics and it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770 
to find a few messages economics and it
says<00:01:33.960> messages<00:01:34.500> only<00:01:35.340> nice<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.390> buy<00:01:36.570> now

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
says messages only nice little buy now

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
says messages only nice little buy now
price<00:01:36.960> maybe<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.100> let's<00:01:38.310> search<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
price maybe so let's search for that and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
price maybe so let's search for that and
let's<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.560> hopefully<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
let's see what we have got hopefully so

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.109 
let's see what we have got hopefully so
seventeen<00:01:42.030> thousand<00:01:42.540> coins<00:01:42.770> 18,000<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:44.820> for

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
