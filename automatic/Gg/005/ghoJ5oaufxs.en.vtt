 three eggs and 100 grams of butter before 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.939
 to prepare the cake dough puts your 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 oven preheated to 180 degrees and leaves 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.369
 all ingredients in temperature 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.110
 environment 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.210
 Now it's easy I'll put butter and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 mixer that has 100 grams so it's just 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.320
 you buy a tablet of 200 and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 dividing means that he and I do not have 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 I'm also using the car of the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.320
 I get local crystal sugar and I'll beat up 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 form a cream 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.280
 now it's time to add the eggs 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.780
 add them all here at once but 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.350
 you can add from one and 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 hitting but it makes me hit another one 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 a little 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.070
 so you have a good mix 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.080
 add the milk to the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.570
 A little bit then turn on the mixer and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.100
 put a little milk even 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.110
 will now trigger the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.479
 dry ingredients so I'll put the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.190
 coconut and wheat flour by placing 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.900
 too slow to mix 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.119
 all very well 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.119
 put a spoon while letting down 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.910
 the body was already inspired and I forgot 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.009
 to tell you that he does not 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.900
 there is sugar and the flour I'm using 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.730
 she also has no yeast I go 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.110
 add my wound and it is always 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.370
 best choice 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
 I'll also put her to the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.990
 A little here and beating to stay 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 baking powder 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.530
 I'm using chemical yeast to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 good with the traditional yeast and 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.660
 Let's hit just enough to show 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.660
 a little 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.430
 The recipe as I said is super 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.990
 fast is basically just mix all 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.850
 the ingredients and now I'm going to 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.830
 a greased and floured form 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.410
 remember to always put in the middle of the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.700
 way to not overflow is one plus one 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.040
 A little bit heavy because 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.040
 practically coconut here is delicious 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.379
 It is good to have a good analysis here in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.890
 mass and everything stays right grows 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.989

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.290
 minutes or until the toothpick test 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.879
