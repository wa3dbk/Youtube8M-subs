00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
GTA series who have the same name but

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.360 
GTA series who have the same name but
that<00:03:58.959> does<00:03:59.139> not<00:03:59.170> mean<00:03:59.590> they<00:04:00.010> are<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.340> same

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
that does not mean they are the same

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.490 
that does not mean they are the same
character<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.480> little<00:04:01.720> quote<00:04:01.840> by<00:04:02.019> Rockstar

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
character and a little quote by Rockstar

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.520 
character and a little quote by Rockstar
says<00:04:02.799> probably<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.970> seems<00:04:04.209> very<00:04:04.450> likely<00:04:04.840> but

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
says probably it seems very likely but

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.890 
says probably it seems very likely but
it's<00:04:05.650> also<00:04:05.829> possible<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.639> there<00:04:07.150> are<00:04:07.389> just<00:04:07.660> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
it's also possible that there are just a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's also possible that there are just a
lot<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.290> angry<00:04:08.560> silent<00:04:09.040> car<00:04:09.220> thieves<00:04:09.430> called
