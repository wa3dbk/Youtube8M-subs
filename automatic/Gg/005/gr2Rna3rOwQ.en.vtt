00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.949 
genuinely interested in other people
my<00:02:24.310> mother<00:02:24.549> was<00:02:24.760> genuinely<00:02:25.240> interested<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
my mother was genuinely interested in

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.720 
my mother was genuinely interested in
everybody<00:02:26.350> she<00:02:26.890> said<00:02:27.069> everybody<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.550> teach

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
everybody she said everybody can teach

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.809 
everybody she said everybody can teach
me<00:02:27.910> something<00:02:27.940> she<00:02:28.720> was<00:02:28.840> very<00:02:29.020> successful<00:02:29.230> in

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
me something she was very successful in

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.759 
me something she was very successful in
and<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.239> believe<00:02:30.510> one<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.170> main<00:02:31.319> reasons

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
and I believe one of the main reasons

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.739 
and I believe one of the main reasons
was<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:31.980> she<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.430> genuinely<00:02:32.969> interested<00:02:33.659> in

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
was that she was genuinely interested in

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.899 
was that she was genuinely interested in
other<00:02:33.900> people<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.769> she<00:02:34.980> let<00:02:35.159> them<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.609> great

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
other people and she let them do a great

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.119 
other people and she let them do a great
deal<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.329> talking<00:02:36.749> mother<00:02:37.620> would<00:02:37.859> get<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
deal of the talking mother would get to

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.039
