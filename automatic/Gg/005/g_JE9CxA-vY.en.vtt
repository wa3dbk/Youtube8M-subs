the<00:02:55.490> game<00:02:55.700> pretty<00:02:55.910> much<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.780> right

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
the game pretty much this is right

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.100 
the game pretty much this is right
before<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:58.280> whole<00:02:58.490> Strider<00:02:59.300> part<00:02:59.660> this<00:03:00.050> is

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
before the whole Strider part this is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.380 
before the whole Strider part this is
after<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.220> just<00:03:01.250> after<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.940> hospital

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390

area<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.620> we're<00:03:03.740> gonna<00:03:03.800> fast<00:03:04.100> forward<00:03:04.190> this

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
area so we're gonna fast forward this

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.850 
area so we're gonna fast forward this
part<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:05.000> Park<00:03:05.750> locked<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.170> done<00:03:06.320> fast<00:03:06.620> in

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
part is Park locked in done fast in

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.860 
part is Park locked in done fast in
about<00:03:07.130> about<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> half<00:03:08.150> an<00:03:08.300> hour<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.500> um<00:03:10.870> yeah

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
about about a half an hour so um yeah

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.000 
about about a half an hour so um yeah
this<00:03:12.050> part<00:03:12.230> takes<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> little<00:03:12.530> while<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.890> is

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
this part takes a little while this is

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.140 
this part takes a little while this is
probably<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> longest<00:03:13.459> parts<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.000> game

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
probably the longest parts of the game

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
probably the longest parts of the game
the<00:03:14.900> very<00:03:15.080> first<00:03:15.260> part<00:03:15.410> there's<00:03:15.650> absolutely

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the very first part there's absolutely

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.430 
the very first part there's absolutely
nothing<00:03:16.160> happens<00:03:16.610> that's<00:03:16.959> that's<00:03:17.959> that's

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
nothing happens that's that's that's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.340 
nothing happens that's that's that's
easy<00:03:18.709> as<00:03:18.890> hell<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.940> now<00:03:20.630> expects<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.050> juggle

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
more hoppers and moving hoppers and at

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.290 
more hoppers and moving hoppers and at
this<00:06:03.590> time<00:06:03.860> just<00:06:04.220> make<00:06:04.520> sure<00:06:04.669> life<00:06:04.820> hell<00:06:05.060> but

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
this time just make sure life hell but

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.730 
this time just make sure life hell but
you<00:06:05.690> can<00:06:05.870> do<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:05.960> nice<00:06:06.139> little<00:06:06.260> trick<00:06:06.530> that<00:06:06.650> I've

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
you can do a nice little trick that I've

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.140 
you can do a nice little trick that I've
learned<00:06:06.949> about<00:06:07.039> hoppers<00:06:07.430> is<00:06:07.639> actually<00:06:08.000> weight

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
learned about hoppers is actually weight

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.300 
learned about hoppers is actually weight
from<00:06:08.389> bringing<00:06:08.810> up<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.080> um<00:06:09.380> should<00:06:10.099> rock

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
from bringing up that um should rock

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.890 
from bringing up that um should rock
around<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.669> door<00:06:10.880> blows<00:06:11.150> open<00:06:11.449> and<00:06:11.810> you'll

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
around the door blows open and you'll

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.510 
around the door blows open and you'll
kill<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.260> combine<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.979> other<00:06:13.099> one<00:06:13.220> pops<00:06:13.400> and

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
kill to combine the other one pops and

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.790 
kill to combine the other one pops and
you<00:06:13.580> go<00:06:13.669> hey<00:06:14.199> and<00:06:15.199> you<00:06:15.289> just<00:06:15.410> shoot<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.650> rocket

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
you go hey and you just shoot a rocket

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.379 
you go hey and you just shoot a rocket
as<00:06:15.979> face<00:06:16.250> but<00:06:16.520> um<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.910> hopper<00:06:17.150> trick<00:06:17.300> I

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
as face but um the hopper trick I

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.200 
as face but um the hopper trick I
learned<00:06:17.630> is<00:06:17.840> if<00:06:18.169> you<00:06:18.410> run<00:06:18.650> at<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:19.099> hopper<00:06:19.460> with

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
learned is if you run at the hopper with

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.310 
learned is if you run at the hopper with
your<00:06:20.360> gravity<00:06:20.660> gun<00:06:20.750> out

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
your gravity gun out

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.190 
your gravity gun out
you<00:06:22.920> will<00:06:23.070> grab<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.180> can<00:06:24.300> crab<00:06:24.540> brycie<00:06:24.840> hops

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
you will grab you can crab brycie hops

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.890 
you will grab you can crab brycie hops
up<00:06:25.380> you<00:06:25.500> have<00:06:25.590> been<00:06:25.710> good<00:06:25.890> at<00:06:26.040> it<00:06:26.130> though<00:06:26.280> I<00:06:26.900> end

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
up you have been good at it though I end

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.690 
up you have been good at it though I end
up<00:06:28.020> doing<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.470> like<00:06:28.830> when<00:06:29.040> I<00:06:29.070> make<00:06:29.250> my<00:06:29.370> Strider

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
up doing it like when I make my Strider

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.420 
up doing it like when I make my Strider
video<00:06:30.030> which<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.300> probably<00:06:30.540> will<00:06:30.810> do<00:06:30.960> next

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
video which I probably will do next

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.260 
video which I probably will do next
you'll<00:06:32.430> see<00:06:32.610> that<00:06:32.730> I<00:06:32.790> actually<00:06:32.910> do<00:06:33.090> that<00:06:33.210> a

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
you'll see that I actually do that a

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.210 
you'll see that I actually do that a
couple<00:06:33.450> of<00:06:33.600> times<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:34.320> makes<00:06:34.800> it<00:06:34.980> a<00:06:35.040> lot<00:06:35.160> easier

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
couple of times it makes it a lot easier

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.400 
couple of times it makes it a lot easier
for<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.090> to<00:06:36.120> deal<00:06:36.630> with<00:06:36.660> them<00:06:37.080> in<00:06:37.200> a<00:06:37.260> very

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
for you to deal with them in a very

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.680 
for you to deal with them in a very
enclosed<00:06:37.740> area<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.310> deal<00:06:38.520> quickly<00:06:38.730> now<00:06:39.150> if<00:06:39.600> you

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
enclosed area I deal quickly now if you

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.940 
enclosed area I deal quickly now if you
move<00:06:39.810> this<00:06:39.870> hopper<00:06:40.320> you<00:06:40.470> will<00:06:41.250> actually<00:06:41.460> stop

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
move this hopper you will actually stop

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.370 
move this hopper you will actually stop
combined<00:06:43.950> from<00:06:44.100> popping<00:06:44.400> behind<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:45.380> it's

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
combined from popping behind you it's

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.170 
combined from popping behind you it's
very<00:06:46.620> very<00:06:46.830> cool<00:06:46.980> when<00:06:47.160> you<00:06:47.250> do<00:06:47.340> that<00:06:47.550> and<00:06:47.820> it

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
very very cool when you do that and it

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.120 
very very cool when you do that and it
makes<00:06:48.360> your<00:06:48.540> life<00:06:48.690> a<00:06:48.780> lot<00:06:48.810> easier<00:06:48.930> now<00:06:49.920> you<00:06:49.980> get
