00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
salt what happens is it releases

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.600 
salt what happens is it releases
moisture<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.620> salt<00:04:57.919> draws<00:04:58.069> out<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> moisture

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
moisture the salt draws out the moisture

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.999 
moisture the salt draws out the moisture
and<00:04:59.389> it<00:04:59.539> makes<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.840> little<00:04:59.960> sauce<00:05:00.319> these<00:05:00.830> are
