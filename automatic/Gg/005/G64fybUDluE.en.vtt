00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.370
 Of course, if eating is fine, very 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.720
 happy to be here is our first 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.570
 once at the telehit awards then 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.370
 we are very happy hopefully also for 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.320
 the following year we are already nominated not 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.200
 something extra that would be amazing 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.490
 tell us how this year has gone 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.130
 it's true that it's been pretty good 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.690
 but how do you see it this year? 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.130
 three of our singles came out 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.720
 then what was a very strong year 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.430
 for us right now is the third 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.410
 site that is called giant sounding 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 so if you want to hear if they are 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.130
 Burning in love is the song 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.080
 indicated to dedicate it hears to depart 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.580
 of everything that is something a few months ago 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.710
 they said that you looked a lot like nick 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.270
 jonas and here is nick jonas sun you 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.950
 you are going to approach nick jonas to tell him 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 How is it that I am your Mexican double or 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.110
 something out there if I want to look for it we can 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.030
 send a picture of the two and so on 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.040
 having the direct reference say be 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.470
 it's crisis and I look alike although I think 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.550
 takes you four arms 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.400
 maybe 2 meters inspiration for 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 you since the jonas came out 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 brothers the truth is something that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.930
 we listened and admired musically 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.420
 then yes it has been part of the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.520
 inspirations that he had me in his career 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.930
 and tell us what comes for bpm on 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 hopefully next year as they say that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.310
 we can see nominees here in the awards 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.220
 telehit but you 'll tour what's going to happen with the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.210
 bridge disk, we are starting with 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.530
 compose songs for the second album 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.850
 this does not start production but 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 we are starting to compose for the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.720
 second album and then we hope it comes out 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.360
 already for next year and we manage to cross 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.910
 borders next year I would not be 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.650
 amazing where would you like to visit 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.330
 these countries with their music then 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.610
 Latin America mainly to me 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.870
 I would love to go to Brazil and it is far from 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.870
 Spain or Italy or something like that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.020
 largest in Spain and apart from that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.880
 now they are very followed by 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.410
 girls and all this question to you 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.790
 It bothers them sometimes that the girls are 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.530
 so insistent with you for example 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.030
 through social networks not at 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.230
 otherwise we like we like them to be 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.590
 to pay attention to us just like 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.900
 we of them so girls 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.819
 tweeting and sending us everything that we 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.980
 they want to send something else that they have left 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.989
