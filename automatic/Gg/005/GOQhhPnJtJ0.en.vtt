00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.050

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.689
 it's a super simple idea very fast 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 but very nice to do and well this 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.230
 anything you already know let me know 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.970
 down here in the background of the video the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.890
 materials below the photos to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.600
 final and well then we will be seeing 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 soon in another video bay 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.220
 once we have our materials 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.800
 so let's start let's use the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.940
 corrugated paper either fomy with 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.239
 diamond 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.680
 this is a letter size sheet and in that 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.449
 let's do let's put to heat 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 our gun 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.909
 we are going to use the silicon we are going to apply 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.909
 our being with this part of here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.320
 and we are going to paste it 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.320
 making a cylinder that way 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.780
 all right 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.920
 Now let's do the same 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 procedure with this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.250
 well once we have our 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 cylinder and on this occasion I present to you 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.370
 so three different models either in 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.800
 white either in orange or you can 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.200
 get corrugated paper in red or in 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.290
 white as you prefer and foamy with 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.820
 diamond on this occasion is red and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.619
 the next thing we're going to do then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 wrapping our gift the detail that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.900
 you want to give as you know, do not be a bear 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 stuffed here can not be a 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.420
 shirt, a shirt, I do not know what you 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.080
 you prefer to give nothing else you have to double what 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.340
 pretty good 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:17.350
 rollito do so shaped cylinder 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.070
 and put it in and put it in and leave it there that's 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.860
 all 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.130
 we can put 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.280
 Kitty 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.740
 in this way 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.569
 and as you can see, that's how the 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.760
 next wrap you have to use 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.319
 our cellophane paper 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.250
 as follows in our paper 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.260
 cellophane well then quite broad this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.879
 I bought it by sheet then I do not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.640
 would know more or less how much it measures but what 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.910
 divided into four parts because in itself it is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 pretty for nothing our gift 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.190
 we are going to place a piece in our 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.100
 table where we are working we are going to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.160
 grab our cylinder and 'the with 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.820
 our gift inside and we're going to 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.820
 go wrapping 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.879
 once it is already here we can place 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:15.780
 this is tape or a drop of 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.769
 silicone 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 and paste so that it does not disarm well what 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.739
 next is to use the slats and 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 are in red or white stamped the one 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.480
 you prefer, remember that later if 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.959
 this is a wrapper more than anything for 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.110
 this February 14 and you decide if it's from 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.690
 hearts and they are smart and well what are we going 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.760
 to do we are going to take our bar in 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.819
 this case the white I bought a meter and a half 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 and cut it in half then the 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.040
 done these these cuts to the tips 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.920
 we just have to double our bar and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.530
 cut what and so it remains and good that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.269
 we will do as we will get this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 part as a team with the envelopes that already 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.209
 we are going to start the cylinder 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.209
 as much as possible 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.600
 and we closed our bar postponed and 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.660
 we make the movement 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.000
 well, that's how our 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.930

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.930
 process 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.750
 and well, as you can see, this is another 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.820
 option

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.320

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.230
 I found pink but I would have liked 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.850
 that were red but still remains 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.980
