using the mounting pulse that comes with
your<00:02:12.610> fish<00:02:12.790> finder<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:14.230> will<00:02:14.410> allow<00:02:14.560> you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
your fish finder and this will allow you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.270 
your fish finder and this will allow you
to<00:02:14.880> pivot<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.040> could

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to pivot it and I can actually could

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880 
to pivot it and I can actually could
have<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> 280°<00:02:19.300> actually<00:02:20.140> once<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:20.500> mounted

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
have a 280° actually once it's mounted

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.080 
have a 280° actually once it's mounted
on<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> get<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.970> your

formation on your transducer and and you
just<00:05:17.640> put<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.270> wind<00:05:18.480> net<00:05:18.630> on<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:20.820> could

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
just put the wind net on and you could

actually has in it machined slots so

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.080 
actually has in it machined slots so
that<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.490> can<00:05:35.669> actually<00:05:36.150> manage<00:05:37.080> all<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.320> your

your cabling that comes with these fish

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.219 
your cabling that comes with these fish
finders<00:05:41.090> there's<00:05:42.090> actually<00:05:42.479> quite<00:05:42.900> about

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
finders there's actually quite about

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.200 
finders there's actually quite about
quite<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.590> lot<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.919> cabling<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.400> does<00:05:44.940> come

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
quite a lot of cabling that does come

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.850 
quite a lot of cabling that does come
with<00:05:45.330> them<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.630> you<00:05:45.720> often<00:05:46.050> don't<00:05:46.380> need<00:05:46.620> that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
much so you just put those through and

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.960 
much so you just put those through and
put<00:05:48.900> your<00:05:48.990> cable<00:05:49.200> against<00:05:49.650> here<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:49.890> a<00:05:50.220> wrap

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
put your cable against here and a wrap

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.090 
put your cable against here and a wrap
and<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:53.720> sort<00:05:54.720> of<00:05:54.810> tighten<00:05:55.680> this<00:05:55.770> up<00:05:55.919> around

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
and just sort of tighten this up around

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.400 
and just sort of tighten this up around
the<00:05:56.370> cables<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:56.940> it<00:05:57.060> keeps<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.450> nice<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:58.200> tidy
