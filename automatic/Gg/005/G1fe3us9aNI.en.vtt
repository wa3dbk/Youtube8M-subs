00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.510 
little bit so you know you have to watch
out<00:01:26.410> for<00:01:26.440> people<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.860> roofs<00:01:27.100> people<00:01:27.400> are

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
out for people on the roofs people are

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.100 
out for people on the roofs people are
constantly<00:01:27.760> on<00:01:28.120> top<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.570> buildings<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.990> that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
constantly on top of buildings on that

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.870 
constantly on top of buildings on that
map<00:01:29.260> but<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.070> know<00:01:30.130> Parliament<00:01:30.550> I<00:01:30.640> don't<00:01:30.820> know

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
map but you know Parliament I don't know

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.620 
map but you know Parliament I don't know
there's<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> lot<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.210> different<00:01:31.270> hallways

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
there's a lot of different hallways

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.360 
there's a lot of different hallways
there's<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> lot<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.680> places<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.040> could<00:01:33.190> set

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
there's a lot of places we could set

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.860 
there's a lot of places we could set
back<00:01:33.400> I<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:33.940> really<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.180> are<00:01:34.450> based<00:01:34.720> in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
back I think it's really a are based in

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.480 
back I think it's really a are based in
my<00:01:34.990> opinion<00:01:35.200> now<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:35.890> was<00:01:35.980> playing<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.400> little

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
my opinion now if I was playing a little

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.460 
my opinion now if I was playing a little
bit<00:01:36.700> different<00:01:37.030> maybe<00:01:37.120> like<00:01:37.420> uplink<00:01:37.900> or<00:01:38.110> a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
bit different maybe like uplink or a

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.690 
bit different maybe like uplink or a
hard<00:01:38.920> point<00:01:39.070> or<00:01:39.250> something<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.580> I

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
hard point or something like that I

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.640 
hard point or something like that I
think<00:01:40.000> maybe<00:01:40.270> then<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.990> should<00:01:41.170> use<00:01:41.290> an<00:01:41.380> SMG

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
think maybe then you should use an SMG

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.560 
think maybe then you should use an SMG
not<00:01:41.980> too<00:01:42.160> sure<00:01:42.370> though<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:43.300> then<00:01:43.420> there's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
not too sure though and then there's

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.330 
not too sure though and then there's
another<00:01:43.630> map<00:01:43.930> called<00:01:44.140> compound<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.890> compound

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
another map called compound a compound

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.210 
another map called compound a compound
is<00:01:45.520> probably<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.690> probably<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.710> least<00:01:47.860> fair<00:01:48.040> map

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
is probably a probably my least fair map

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.860 
is probably a probably my least fair map
all<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.640> others<00:01:48.820> let<00:01:49.000> my<00:01:49.090> least<00:01:49.450> favorite<00:01:49.750> map

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
all the others let my least favorite map

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.140 
all the others let my least favorite map
i<00:01:50.020> hate<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.470> map<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.520> clusterfuck

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
i hate the map it is just a clusterfuck

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.370 
i hate the map it is just a clusterfuck
in<00:01:52.330> my<00:01:52.390> opinion<00:01:52.630> there's<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:52.990> many<00:01:53.080> people

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
in my opinion there's so many people

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.720 
in my opinion there's so many people
everywhere<00:01:53.740> you're<00:01:54.130> always<00:01:54.340> getting<00:01:54.430> shot<00:01:54.700> in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
everywhere you're always getting shot in

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.370 
everywhere you're always getting shot in
the<00:01:54.850> back<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.240> there's<00:01:55.660> actually<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:56.110> fake

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
enemy targets all throughout the map and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.280 
enemy targets all throughout the map and
they<00:01:58.120> actually<00:01:58.270> trick<00:01:58.720> me<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.080> like<00:01:59.200> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
they like chain guns so you need to make

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.319 
they like chain guns so you need to make
sure<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.310> don't<00:02:25.549> die<00:02:25.760> about<00:02:25.939> those<00:02:26.120> things

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329
