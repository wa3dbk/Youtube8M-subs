 hello my name is angels regiane today 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.869
 I'll make you the cup that is 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 which is further converted into a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.560
 frying pan which was also inverted 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.689
 use of it is different then a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.210
 common frying pan is like in any 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.029
 place with that cheap shop 20 reais 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.640
 I paid for this and it's super easy and does the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.610
 I want it to be fine, the dough is the same 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.199
 to business mass strength will also 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.220
 stay here underneath recipe for who 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.420
 does not have 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.290
 so I 'll explain how it starts 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.699
 the medium is neither high nor very low 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.949
 left a little the frying pan 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:56.080
 fun with it or with butter or 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 Who do you want, I'm going to throw some pretzels 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.670
 which is appropriate for this 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.880
 the mass is I usually rush dish 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:17.170
 background that makes it easy to put one more 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:19.330
 little that you come with a 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:32.140
 inverted pan that is because he wants to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:33.090
 her name and goes to the boot again in the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.950
 lining 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.290
 She'll start cooking from the inside. 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.370
 out and from the bottom up and will 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.110
 dropping 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.940
 you can take the help of a fork to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.450
 drop cool borders on this pancake 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.640
 so thin is not enough. 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.970
 feeling dangerous of very strong mass 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.860
 very heavy so it's practice you 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.630
 keep training the amount a cup 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.600
