00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.329
 shoot it or not so in a group 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.590
 VKontakte I will do a small survey 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.680
 where you can participate and if 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 want to be sure to take it off 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.409
 kill shit any way 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.829

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.210
 I know I still have not come out like as soon as dna 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:45.629
 description on the VKontakte group on 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.959

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.680
 link and vote we play with 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.510

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.200
 maybe 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.519
 little magic box see what's there 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 it will be interesting if I stand 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.780
 right here it will appear or not but not 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.659
 We will check because somehow 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.239
 time i checked 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.989
 as they appear and who remember a fig 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.769
 se bought up something remembers i put put 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.299
 the chest to block the floor, he did not nifiga 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.760
 appeared ugta and this is lucky it 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.389
 lucky such cool things to sit 30 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 arrows 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:32.220
 yeah cool cool okay let's 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.769
 let's go even higher let's see what we have 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.549
 then there's nothing upstairs well we 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.000
 there is a workbench 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.620
 As far as I know, yes here on the Crystalix 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.659
 also have a workbench we still have 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.840
 wood so i can still craft 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.530
 a bunch of these swords why did they give me unnecessary 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.859
 opinion and pick I, too, well, as a point of mouth 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.560
 we will throw out the patient and now it probably stands 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.159
 already go look for people all the same already 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.239
 dressed so heard where there was a lightning strike 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:10.229
 Here in the other side of the flour and go to 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.620
 about the reason why suddenly decided at all 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:15.480
 shoot the file well five nights freddie so 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.760
 easier to smoke 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 just for a long time there were no clips from the web 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.760
 camera 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.460
 I shot on the first channel and a well 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.350
 horror game called slender man there 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.080
 something not remembering the arrival in my opinion like that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.620
 so well, too, it all went on the ground 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.210
 the channel that cuirassir gaming I have 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.820
 That was a long time ago when I only 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.030
 Began to say more than a year already 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.890
 back probably something here and me 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.390
 wanted to somehow sat thinking today 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.350
 what is it in the box some want 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.230
 play and this horror from I looked 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.170
 enough is good interesnenko 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.550
 so in general we'll see how 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:07.000
 didn't deceive my first idea about 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:09.040
 him me like a ox zil to her and we pass 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.940
 we are passing now here a little more 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.700
 run and from the bow to him behind the bullet 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.760
 boom straight lecho or I do not know where 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.770
 there she got all perfectly finished 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.190
 one player he was personally Andrei King 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.870
 a potion that restores my life 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:32.380
 Ender Pearl, and what else interesting that the same 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.840
 still interesting let's eat so 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.130
 Now look at the shoes, I look no 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.210
 he is a little almazik Do not you think 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.370
 something took off for me 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:50.410
 oh boy one more guy who 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:55.450
 tried to ruin me with his potion but not 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:57.400
 so everything is easy so here you are now so 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.980
 will you die that's fine 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.680
 didn't even take off any wing perfectly 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.480
 so with him in theory something interesting too 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.770
 fell let's see what is 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.350
 interesting paid a bursting hilka so 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.610
 nobody their goes bib bib 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.520
 let's pick up the bib speakers all 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.060
 on baby me but the rest is not me 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.639
 need starts now this match 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.780
 and the iron sword is fine although I can 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.540
 diamond diamond 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:33.010
 I do not have time so take true hilke 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.460
 in such a way now these players 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.940
 we look run up to different 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:46.750
 parties and let us go after one of 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:52.389
 them so that he or she immediately reset to 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:55.479
 her merge and kiddy and great one 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:58.090
 the player we have already killed is still to kill 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.930
 one that she escapes from below and 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.889
 ran after things i went to collect things 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.889
 it certainly was pretty good with 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:13.020
 this player's sides are gone like this 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:16.690
 I wonder myself now at home wildebeest 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.160
 let's use ender film to her 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:25.060
 some one that almost killed me damn 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.479
 yes it was very sad it would be 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.960
 sad if me ender perley killed 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:33.340
 that life remained very little well it 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.789
