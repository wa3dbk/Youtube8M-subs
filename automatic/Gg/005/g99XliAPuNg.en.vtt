00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 the cuckoo players scene all the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.490
 world today we find ourselves for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.250
 discover together the content of this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.370
 box my little pony so that contains 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.109
 a customizable rainbow figurine 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.439
 local dash and customizable actually 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.119
 because we have the opportunity through 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.100
 pencils the pens that are provided 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.560
 inside of the coloring and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.810
 stick a lot of pretty stickers 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 we will discover together just after 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.040
 here are examples of what we can 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 make 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.660
 So here are all the conspiracy stickers 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 collar and the way we can 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 coloring rainbow dash and you are 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 poor vincent of our figurines then 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.789
 she is really really great 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.710
 cute so that's the rainbow 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.809
 of purchase that we know German that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.090
 did judo colors and suddenly we will 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.180
 can do together a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.410
 customization of rainbow dash these 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 little waves we can 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.140
 we'll be able to color and then a little 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 rainbow lightning and some little ones 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.409
 drawings we'll be able to color so in 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.710
 the box it remains our tools for the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.299
 customization our stickers 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's just here the first one a purple 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.290
 and the second one a red 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.360
 here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.810
 then to the number first feed our 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.520
 transparent key stickers that we are going 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:41.720
 can color and pretty cars 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.250
 multicolored and sequined tights 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 so what I advise is to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.979
 start by coloring the only ones to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.440
 coloring since once they will 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.520
 asked on the pony it will be a little bit 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.950
 more a little more delicate has by 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 example little hearts to color 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.110
 obviously a lot but it's also a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.110
 star 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.280
 the fair coloring there is really 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.880
 free rein to your imagination 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.520
 if you have other felt you can 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.569
 use them 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.950
 why laurel 1 colorful day 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.040
 a few to show you what that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.020
 give it here so I took 3 at 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.630
 chance but we will be able to use all 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 the others on our our pony we can 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.640
 also we can also color some 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.080
 elements then we have here for example a 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 two little hearts that we will color 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.500
 directly on the pony he will do the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 clear 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:02.920
 and then we'll also do the inside of 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 our l can also queue 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.150
 we pay attention to our doors there 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.440
 has passed 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.830
 and then we really start having 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.720
 something very very pretty we're going 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.720
 do the same on the wind 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.610
 we will do one of the two small drops 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.400
 here is now we will take the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.460
 purple and you continue to decorate 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.470
 age level so there for example I 'm going 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.620
 to make here the link between the two little ones 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:47.010
 hearts too I'm doing the second little 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.010
 drop 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.460
 and your side 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.590
 of lightning 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.549
 so here we will do the other part of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.549
 we want it like that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.900
 unconscious 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.900
 from past paris 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.180
 and here's our little pony 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.780
 coloring that's what it can give 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.720
 so we colored all that is 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.240
 mane and that in red and purple 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.890
 same for wings and both sides 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.720
 so that really wants some 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.430
 very very pretty thing and we can 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.800
 to really do as we want 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.540
 really that is very nice more 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.820
 has the stickers so we will start 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.360
 by multicolored self-tights and at 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.270
 flakes 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.850
 so we will take a little what we want 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.310
 so here I can start with that one 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.290
 a little drop and blue and we at the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.540
 paste everywhere we want on rule 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.540
 to the dash so there for example 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.050
 hop 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:18.350
 to come of course and the other to 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.350
 sides here for example 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.349
 we end decor with stickers that 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.419
 colored ourselves we add on 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.759
 a bo age we will for example take 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.449
 this little rainbow that we colored 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:40.900
 ourselves using felts and we at 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:43.470
 read liked everywhere we go as 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.470
 a little heart 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.249
 alerted right here 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.799
 last 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:59.109
 we will put nine years a little star 

00:05:53.799 --> 00:06:01.979
 up on the feet and that's it we have our 

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:05.349
 rainbow dash which is all customize 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.419
 it's really done as we want 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.099
 add the stickers we want we can 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.889
 remove and choose others 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.319
 finally for to change as and when 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.349
 measure and now we can play 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.889
