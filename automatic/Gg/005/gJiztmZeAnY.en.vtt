00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
here but we'll stick with satellite and
then<00:02:20.160> follow<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.880> route<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> also<00:02:23.010> check<00:02:23.250> out

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
then follow the route and also check out

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.300 
then follow the route and also check out
traffic<00:02:23.730> which<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> green<00:02:25.800> so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
traffic which we have see the green so

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.880 
traffic which we have see the green so
no<00:02:26.520> big<00:02:26.700> problems<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> we're

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
no big problems there so we're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
no big problems there so we're
simulating<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.610> route<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.330> use<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.750> get

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
simulating the route that we use to get

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.690 
simulating the route that we use to get
there<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.410> also<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.370> major

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
there you can also see on major

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.840 
there you can also see on major
intersections<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.980> person<00:02:43.980> icon<00:02:44.310> shows<00:02:44.640> up

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
intersections a person icon shows up

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
intersections a person icon shows up
it's<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.170> show<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.380> where<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.800> need<00:02:46.830> to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it's going to show you where you need to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.850 
it's going to show you where you need to
turn<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.670> intersection<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.710> also

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
turn on that intersection you can also

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.230 
turn on that intersection you can also
use<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.280> person<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.930> google<00:02:52.290> street<00:02:52.710> view

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
use the person to get google street view

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.670 
use the person to get google street view
so<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.270> can<00:02:54.390> spin<00:02:54.840> around<00:02:54.990> here<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.500> then

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
so you can spin around here and then

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.670 
so you can spin around here and then
continue<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.640> your<00:03:02.940> route<00:03:03.440> we're<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> go

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
continue on your route we're going to go

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.880 
continue on your route we're going to go
ahead<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.160> car<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.880> actually<00:03:06.270> drive

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
ahead to the car now and actually drive

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.010 
ahead to the car now and actually drive
so<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> had<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> droid<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.209> universal

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
so I had the droid here in a universal

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.650 
so I had the droid here in a universal
cradle<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.010> also<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.820> course<00:03:11.910> pick

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
cradle but you can also of course pick

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.710 
cradle but you can also of course pick
up<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.050> droid<00:03:13.530> cradle<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.420> will<00:03:15.540> work

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
up the droid cradle but it will work

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.270 
up the droid cradle but it will work
just<00:03:15.959> fine<00:03:16.080> with<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.100> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
just fine with this you just have to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.199

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
to the right to answer you can see we're

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.510 
to the right to answer you can see we're
still<00:04:27.690> connected<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.470> call<00:04:28.650> by<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.040> icon

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
still connected to the call by the icon

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.940 
still connected to the call by the icon
up<00:04:29.669> there<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.600> if<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:30.900> pull<00:04:31.169> down<00:04:31.350> our<00:04:31.380> window

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
up there and if we pull down our window

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.180 
up there and if we pull down our window
shade<00:04:33.830> we<00:04:34.830> can<00:04:35.010> return<00:04:35.340> back<00:04:36.770> flip<00:04:37.770> back<00:04:37.950> that

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
shade we can return back flip back that

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.970 
shade we can return back flip back that
way<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.690> continue<00:04:39.690> going<00:04:39.840> well<00:04:40.380> we<00:04:40.620> talked<00:04:40.860> to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
way and continue going well we talked to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:52.720 
way and continue going well we talked to
the<00:04:41.160> person<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.550> we're<00:04:41.730> talking<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.510 

you<00:04:53.730> can<00:04:54.000> see<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.180> google<00:04:54.720> navigation<00:04:55.650> still

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
you can see that google navigation still

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.910 
you can see that google navigation still
is<00:04:56.670> in<00:04:56.820> beta<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.390> isn't<00:04:58.110> completely<00:04:58.500> flawless

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
is in beta and isn't completely flawless

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.180 
is in beta and isn't completely flawless
you<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.490> see<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.940> wanted<00:05:00.300> us<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.890> take<00:05:01.890> a

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
you can see that it wanted us to take a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.160 
you can see that it wanted us to take a
loop<00:05:02.640> around<00:05:02.880> which<00:05:03.360> would<00:05:03.540> not<00:05:03.660> be<00:05:03.720> the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
loop around which would not be the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.410 
loop around which would not be the
shortest<00:05:04.680> way<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.070> get<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.730> our<00:05:05.760> destination

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.960 

and<00:05:09.420> we're<00:05:09.660> here
