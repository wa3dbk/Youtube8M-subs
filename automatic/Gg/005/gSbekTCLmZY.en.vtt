all<00:00:00.450> right<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.500> will<00:00:01.709> be<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.829> new<00:00:02.129> little

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right so this will be a new little

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.940 
all right so this will be a new little
short<00:00:03.060> series<00:00:03.540> like<00:00:03.959> one<00:00:04.200> do<00:00:04.350> only<00:00:04.500> where<00:00:04.920> I

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
short series like one do only where I

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190 
short series like one do only where I
pull<00:00:05.220> off<00:00:05.400> obviously<00:00:06.180> impossible<00:00:06.480> combos

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
pull off obviously impossible combos

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.960 
pull off obviously impossible combos
that<00:00:07.230> would<00:00:07.500> never<00:00:07.830> work<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.309> an<00:00:08.400> actual<00:00:08.700> duel

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
that would never work in an actual duel

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.180 
that would never work in an actual duel
but<00:00:09.809> are<00:00:10.139> still<00:00:10.349> technically<00:00:10.920> possible

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
but are still technically possible

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.160 
but are still technically possible
they're<00:00:12.059> meant<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.719> fun<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
they're meant to be just for fun and to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.709 
they're meant to be just for fun and to
be<00:00:13.290> super<00:00:13.860> convoluted<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.700> weird<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.360> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
be super convoluted and weird which I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.000 
be super convoluted and weird which I
think<00:00:16.139> fits<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> theme<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.770> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
think fits with the theme of this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:01:13.540 
think fits with the theme of this
channel

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.830 

okay<00:01:14.550> now<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.120> thought<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.510> would<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.659> best

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
okay now then I thought it would be best

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.260 
okay now then I thought it would be best
to<00:01:16.080> explain<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> combo<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:18.120> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to explain what the combo actually is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.840 
to explain what the combo actually is
like<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> end<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.350> video<00:01:19.850> originally

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like at the end of the video originally

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
like at the end of the video originally
I<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.090> wanted<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.630> toon<00:01:22.050> roll<00:01:22.440> back<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I also wanted to use toon roll back that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.240 
I also wanted to use toon roll back that

toon monster and then I use the effects

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.139 
toon monster and then I use the effects
of<00:01:57.080> well<00:01:58.080> toon<00:01:58.890> world<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.670> allow<00:01:59.880> him<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
of well toon world to allow him to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.150 
of well toon world to allow him to
attack<00:02:00.450> directly<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
attack directly actually is it the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.469 
attack directly actually is it the
effects<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> toon<00:02:02.670> world<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.970> two<00:02:03.090> months<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
there's no monster and can't act your

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.950 
there's no monster and can't act your
opponent<00:02:05.880> directly<00:02:06.000> yeah<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.330> basically<00:02:06.509> does

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
opponent directly yeah I basically does

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
opponent directly yeah I basically does
use<00:02:07.110> comic<00:02:07.470> can<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.890> turn<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> into<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> toon

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
use comic can to turn it into a toon

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.830 
use comic can to turn it into a toon
monster<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> attack<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.509> opponent

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
monster and to attack my opponent

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500 
monster and to attack my opponent
directly<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.430> convoluted<00:02:11.820> way<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
directly so really convoluted way just

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
directly so really convoluted way just
because<00:02:12.630> one<00:02:12.900> times<00:02:13.140> dragons<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> pain<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
because one times dragons a pain in the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.670 
because one times dragons a pain in the
ass<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.850> basically<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.540> -<00:02:16.049> for

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
ass to get out you basically go - for

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.220 
ass to get out you basically go - for
just<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.310> bring<00:02:17.519> them<00:02:17.640> out<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.049> -

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
just to bring them out I think it's -

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.870 
just to bring them out I think it's -
three<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.430> don't<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:20.730> count

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
three actually you don't really count

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.420 
three actually you don't really count
them<00:02:21.090> onto<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> field<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> -<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
them onto that on the field as a - so

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.070 
them onto that on the field as a - so
you<00:02:23.519> go<00:02:23.610> -<00:02:23.790> three<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.209> give<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.870> then

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you go - three to give them out and then

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.199 
you go - three to give them out and then
you<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.950> mystic<00:02:26.400> box<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.790> give<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> your

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you use mystic box to give it to your

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.490 
you use mystic box to give it to your
opponent<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.049> take<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.350> back

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
opponent and then you just take it back

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.930 
opponent and then you just take it back
with<00:02:28.739> comic<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.459> then<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.670> attack

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
with comic can and then you attack

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.569 
with comic can and then you attack
directly<00:02:30.329> for<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:31.500> game<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.250> any<00:02:32.489> of

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
directly for for game if you use any of

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.640 
directly for for game if you use any of
the<00:02:32.640> malefic<00:02:32.850> monsters<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.720> full<00:02:34.019> 8000

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the malefic monsters it's a full 8000
