00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.950
 I'm the corporate director of a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.379
 company that is called houses a company 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.650
 that my partners and I founded 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.199
 really like married for 15 years of a 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.359
 food and drinks company that manages 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.450
 basically restaurants and salons 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.880
 banquets I think steps are being taken 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.800
 I do not see it as steps sometimes 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.450
 you can jump two or three in some 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 moment but you really have to go 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.210
 step by step 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.309
 I go like this, life really is very 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.309
 difficult to think that one is going to end up in 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.999
 somewhere if you are not taking short steps 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 and insurance milan water left me first a 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.530
 academic basis I think it's a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.420
 university that is very balanced and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.819
 that both the academic part but as 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.379
 the training part are both the 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.650
 two fundamental pillars for the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.750
 increase 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.850
 every time I come and every time I speak 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.220
 with the students and with some alumni 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.920
 everybody wants to run we want 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.200
 that does not already have the next stage the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 next project and really I would 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.180
 I would say you know how long you enjoy it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 live intensely because they are going to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 remember for the rest of your life 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 If I am Anahuac del Sur by the program 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.079
 had a very solid program in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.510
 tourist administration and by 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.430
 faculty 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.220
 we were so little and we parked 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.260
 everyone in the gazebo that the rector 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.300
 He peeked out his window and just watching 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.659
 the treatments knew who they were and 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.649
 who were not in college 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.469
 I dedicate myself to serving banquets 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.560
 practically 20 years effectively I 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.149
 I finished in May and October 13 ie 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.640
 a few months later I started to 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.140
 dedicate me is the best thing that has 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.869
 the university is the friendship 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.150
 you live four years 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.340
 and really, you are forming 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.870
 friendship is something that is good 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.440
 important that I believe that when I 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.810
 I studied here just as one realizes it is 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 much the formation of values ​​in the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.480
 moment of complaints believe me that throughout 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.430
 says after goodbye this leave in red 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.840
 Of course it has cost me work and of course 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.490
 that suddenly I wanted to throw the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.320
 towel but you are seeing that the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.450
 years go by and you have results 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.460
 good, it's been worth all this 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.220
 effort because in the end every goal that 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.440
 I have proposed what I have achieved good what 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.500
 I 've loved it and nowadays it's 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 very fashionable wine pairings and other 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.530
 they have increasingly importance 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.960
 Consumption of red wine and white wine in 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.810
 Mexico was really a class that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.630
 I liked work and it's not always art 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.670

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.319
 I'm like corporate 6 claver 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.780
 and actually I have everything that I had 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.730
 searched on the one hand are sales I enjoy 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.830
 a lot to go to a new company to know 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.630
 new people 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.790
 because you never know what you 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.710
 you can go find it's never the same 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.480
 work then that's what I 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.980
 love 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.069
 let's say he left me values 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.769
 it left me strength and helped me see 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.450
 what are my aspirations that one does not 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.860
 give up that always go towards 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.430
 go ahead and that things do not always go 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.379
 to be easy 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.909
 when he's not in the race he says there already 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.650
 I want to leave and I want to leave because 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.239
