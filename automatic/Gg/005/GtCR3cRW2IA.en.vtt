what<00:00:31.340> we're<00:00:31.460> going<00:00:31.580> to<00:00:31.700> do<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.000> quickly<00:00:32.150> remove

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
what we're going to do is quickly remove

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.060 
what we're going to do is quickly remove
the<00:00:32.750> body<00:00:32.900> shell<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.620> we're<00:00:33.710> going<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.890> take<00:00:34.010> a

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
the body shell and we're going to take a

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.680 
the body shell and we're going to take a
closer<00:00:34.400> look<00:00:34.520> underneath<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.150> body<00:00:35.330> shell<00:00:35.540> to

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
closer look underneath the body shell to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.960 
closer look underneath the body shell to
see<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:35.900> we<00:00:36.020> can<00:00:36.200> find<00:00:36.410> under<00:00:37.100> there<00:00:39.550> okay<00:00:40.550> so

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
see what we can find under there okay so

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.080 
see what we can find under there okay so
that<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:41.420> all<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:41.840> can<00:00:42.080> see<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.280> just<00:00:43.879> very

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
that is all you can see it is just very

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.490 
that is all you can see it is just very
very<00:00:44.600> Divya<00:00:45.410> small<00:00:46.120> it's<00:00:47.120> very<00:00:47.500> very

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
very Divya small it's very very

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.830 
very Divya small it's very very
lightweight<00:00:48.830> this<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:49.550> let<00:00:50.540> us<00:00:50.630> take<00:00:50.810> a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
lightweight this one let us take a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.660 
lightweight this one let us take a
closer<00:00:51.350> look<00:00:51.500> here<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.100> can<00:00:52.250> see<00:00:52.460> we've

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
closer look here so you can see we've

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.600 
closer look here so you can see we've
got<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:52.970> type<00:00:53.390> connector<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.290> an<00:00:54.610> xt60

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
got this type connector it's an xt60

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.330 
got this type connector it's an xt60
connector<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.840> these<00:00:57.410> connectors<00:00:57.829> are<00:00:58.100> much

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
connector and these connectors are much

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.160 
connector and these connectors are much
better<00:00:58.579> quality<00:00:58.970> than<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.390> deans<00:00:59.750> type

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
better quality than the deans type

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.770 
better quality than the deans type
connectors<00:01:01.090> simply<00:01:02.090> because<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.540> way<00:01:02.660> they

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
connectors simply because the way they

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.270 
connectors simply because the way they
are<00:01:02.870> constructed<00:01:03.020> they're<00:01:03.680> less<00:01:03.890> likely<00:01:03.920> to

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
are constructed they're less likely to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.570 
are constructed they're less likely to
overheat<00:01:04.850> than<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.080> inside<00:01:06.470> we've<00:01:07.340> got<00:01:07.550> a

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
overheat than the inside we've got a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.499 
overheat than the inside we've got a
very<00:01:07.940> small<00:01:08.060> brushless<00:01:08.990> motor<00:01:09.470> down<00:01:09.830> here

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
very small brushless motor down here

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.190 
very small brushless motor down here
okay

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
okay

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.170 
okay
I<00:01:12.229> think<00:01:12.860> has<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> heatsink<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.610> there<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.090> it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
I think has a heatsink on there but it

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.230 
I think has a heatsink on there but it
probably<00:01:14.300> won't<00:01:14.540> need<00:01:14.750> one<00:01:14.810> anyway<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
probably won't need one anyway and

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.330 
probably won't need one anyway and
finally<00:01:17.240> here<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:17.539> have<00:01:17.780> very<00:01:18.229> small<00:01:18.590> speed

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
finally here we have very small speed

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.460 
finally here we have very small speed
controller<00:01:19.820> there's<00:01:20.119> no<00:01:20.270> fan<00:01:20.570> on<00:01:20.750> there<00:01:20.930> but

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
controller there's no fan on there but

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.160 
controller there's no fan on there but
remember<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:21.890> only<00:01:22.190> runs<00:01:22.400> on<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.700> small

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
remember this only runs on a small

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310 
remember this only runs on a small
simple<00:01:24.170> form<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.740> lipoly<00:01:25.190> battery<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.880> s<00:01:26.260> up<00:01:27.260> to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
simple form of lipoly battery to s up to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.700 
simple form of lipoly battery to s up to
1700<00:01:28.190> MHz<00:01:28.340> probably<00:01:29.240> needs<00:01:29.479> according<00:01:30.350> foul

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
1700 MHz probably needs according foul

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.580 
1700 MHz probably needs according foul
on<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:32.450> connectors<00:01:32.960> are<00:01:33.110> given<00:01:33.380> here

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
on that the connectors are given here

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.590 
on that the connectors are given here
we've<00:01:33.799> got<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.159> speed<00:01:34.640> controller<00:01:35.000> connector

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
we've got the speed controller connector

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.890 
we've got the speed controller connector
and<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.680> have<00:01:36.890> got<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.369> servo<00:01:37.850> connector<00:01:38.270> and

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
and we have got the servo connector and

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.340 
and we have got the servo connector and
all<00:01:39.260> we<00:01:39.350> need<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.590> add<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.010> these<00:01:40.159> ones<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:41.350> 2.40

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
all we need to add to these ones is 2.40

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.280 
all we need to add to these ones is 2.40
radio<00:01:42.650> system<00:01:43.100> which<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.850> will<00:01:44.000> add<00:01:44.210> our<00:01:44.420> later

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
radio system which we will add our later

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.120 
radio system which we will add our later
date<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.369> final<00:01:46.939> thing<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.210> show<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.570> is

simply the steering servo it's all set
up<00:01:51.920> nicely<00:01:52.430> but<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.850> see<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.150> just<00:01:53.659> here

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
up nicely but you can see it just here

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.090 
up nicely but you can see it just here
many<00:01:55.450> very<00:01:56.450> small<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.259> micro<00:01:57.680> SD<00:01:57.979> ring

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
many very small it's a micro SD ring

many very small it's a micro SD ring
server<00:01:58.369> which<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.790> fine<00:01:59.090> until<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.689> need<00:01:59.840> to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
server which is fine until you need to

server which is fine until you need to
find<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.170> replacement<00:02:00.579> that<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.640> one<00:02:01.970> thing

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
find a replacement that is one thing

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.539 
find a replacement that is one thing
I've<00:02:02.360> found<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.259> far<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.040> that

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
I've found so far and that is that

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.240 
I've found so far and that is that
hobbyking<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.600> not<00:02:06.140> very<00:02:06.380> good<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.829> spare

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
hobbyking is not very good at the spare

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.210 
hobbyking is not very good at the spare
parts<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.840> what<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.019> would<00:02:09.140> do<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.829> everything

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
