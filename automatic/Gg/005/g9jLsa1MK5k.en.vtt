00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.470
 you 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.690
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.209
 always if we are in a news item 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 xbox wali from playstation 4 is that 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.289
 attention all because the annexation 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 will consume three times as much electricity 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 according to the study of natural resources 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 defense council new consoles 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 will consume three times as much energy per year 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 electrical than the most recent models 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.149
 of its predecessors the nrc is a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.460
 non-profit ecologist association 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.470
 has carried out an exhaustive study 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.530
 about the electric power consumption of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.000
 playstation 4 and xbox one for this has been 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 embasado are based versions 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.010
 American consoles versions 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 European may perhaps differ a little 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 since here in Europe systems are used 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 different electrical systems but surely 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 the data would be very similar 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.200
 this association point out both the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 own as the cons and admit that 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
 they are and microsoft have done great 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.739
 Progress for your new machines 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.830
 are up to 25% more efficient 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.740
 energetically than the previous ones but 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.140
 and greater capabilities and functions of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.550
 consoles make spending a lot 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.020
 greater as positive points the rdc 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.450
 praises that now it will not be necessary to have 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.550
 the consoles fully on for 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 load the controls and accessories but 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
 just connect the while you are in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.820
 Standby to load 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.070
 correctly however that stand bay 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 It is also part of the problem because 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.920
 although in this mode he spends less in less 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.810
 energy is also true that while 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 it is likewise also consummated 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 consumes energy very long 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.010
 Even when you're not in the room 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.520
 nor loading accessories besides the games 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.950
 nextgen require much more energy 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 according to this study xbox one usa 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.960
 about 40% more energy 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.869
 to play that a normal game in the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.220
 xbox 360 and playstation 4 almost double 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.950
 that the play station 3 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 in the case of xbox one it seems that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.880
 a good part of the expense is due to the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.340
 kinect functions that includes a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 voice recognition and movement what 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 which greatly increases the consumption 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.630
 especially on standby on playstation 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.570
 4 however it is mainly due to a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.910
 Improved electrical efficiency when 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.260
 is fully turned on it is possible that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.480
 the next updates of the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.010
 Console firmware are corrected 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.100
 aspects to achieve greater 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.350
 efficiency and efficiency but it is also 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.209
 possible that next models of the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.459
 consoles manages to get a reduction 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.000
 considerable expenditure of energy as well 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.790
 what should be highlighted 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
 that this study is very good and this is 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.720
 what all the general data 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.190
 compiling so you already know how 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.020
 always informing the last of 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.030
 any detail of the consoles of 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.950
 world of video games and you know 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.120
 like and favorites helps us a lot that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.120
 see you the next news
