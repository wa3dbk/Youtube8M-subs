 Intro- I raise my arms to the sky 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 On my knees I pray 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I'm not afraid anymore, I am no longer afraid 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 I will walk through that door, I will pass that door. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Walk, dance, rise Step out, dance, stand up! 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
