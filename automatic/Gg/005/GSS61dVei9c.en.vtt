00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.159
 well let's work today look what 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.829
 cute is great we can do 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:15.809
 flowers 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:18.570
 How to model with mold with fixer in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.480
 reality or that we model we are going to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 work with the pvc and also that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.870
 You can put decorative objects together like a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 party this but we are this is 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.589
 well just look at how cute bahamas is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.760
 as a design and this one you can put 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.760
 for my fourth state 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.289
 these visions perfect as wool 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.810
 for all modeling in alpaca one 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.970
 marvel here cut a square of pvc 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.790
 we want to add inside the mold and now 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.250
 let's see heat so the mold of 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.360
 that the aluminum canister are milling 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.980
 Now you can model the eva leather 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.540
 4 with many materials 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.019
 in this special you have to have to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.019
 give him warm 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.280
 in the cable until a poop escapes 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.120
 little by little until you were born a little bit 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.820
 because he's modeling of course 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.160
 this enzyme of common form some paste 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160
 viscose a pasta discs 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 and change the color completely here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.659
 is here is opaque now when you 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.179
 we give warmth 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.520
 and when it ran bright when it's going to 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.549
 give shine and now 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.170
 by some of us who have it that way 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.400
 gelatin um 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.009
 with the control of the shape we have mold 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.009
 We found that I love 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 in this case we missed a little bit 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 more heat could return to heat 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.659
 we give more heat you will not realize 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.080
 with the advice let's go here is not 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.050
 good is going to look how good 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.220
 charm 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.200
 here we have to give it a little step 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.890
 more to heat to heat then the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 church 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.980
 the idea is that you can incorporate 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.569
 material like pvc heat it with 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090
 heat gun is with gunmen and 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.549
 well let's move on to the second step if not 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 we went to the second step this this 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.880
 it carefully aside is very hot 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.930
 and that's why you have to handle it with a lot 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.060
 terrific care it became clear that all 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.319
 the instructions very carefully you 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.239
 I say it from experience with a lot 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.010
 be careful why you have seen us and says 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.939
 be very careful because you know 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:55.710
 and now that the armed is easier we go 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:59.880
 to do these tabs for good 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.760
 but what we do here I put a shell 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.660
 little girl on a pin 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.220
 in the sewing filler 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 we will take here and cut 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.620
 with apply back and cut with the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.680
 tool with the pliers and let's 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 preparing this after first what 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.620
 we are going to do is put the sheets here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.420
 so you can apply the sheets of 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.709
 pvc with a stapler 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.709
 machine 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.060
 we put one for the leaves is perfect and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.510
 now this that had been cut from the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.830
 We used to treat the leaves of flowers 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.460
 that big 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.080
 cute 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.980
 what is nice this is all the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.980
 cap that covers 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.810
 be clear in the idea that it fits 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.300
 sign the job because there's a lot of good 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.110
 people who do it to sell or to 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.550
 give away once we count again has 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.970
 to do a job well finished that 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.970
 the beard 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.370
 the frames for example that is the painting 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.190
 for frame I liked more more rustic not 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 you saw that very very determination 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.090
 I do not like this 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.389
 staying 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.320
 let's see 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.820
 so I finish all the flowers 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.050
 actually actually all the flowers 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.340
 the main ones when one is that you 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.170
 like is the melting point of caves going 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.390
 alone goes alone because you can put 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.670
 different colors exactly what it is 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.000
 what I want you to see while continuing 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.060
 ends here comes that above it 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.070
 and also here there are different colors like 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.380
 We have to continue but I love how 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.380
 there is a glass too 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.900
 good is very nice 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.570
 but we have to go see what God me 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.100
 loved the caviar and thanks in addition 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.650
 for all the beautiful things 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.390
 another is that we have to go 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.390
 a big kiss not much
