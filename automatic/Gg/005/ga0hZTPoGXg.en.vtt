then Giroux coming in for some no go up
top<00:00:26.150> somewhere<00:00:27.150> why<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> think<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
top somewhere why do you think that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.230 
top somewhere why do you think that
lineup<00:00:28.130> for<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.759> the<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.060> match

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
lineup for that for the first match

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
lineup for that for the first match
hearing<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> shoot<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.170> well<00:00:31.740> i<00:00:31.800> think

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
hearing is to shoot this well i think

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.370 
hearing is to shoot this well i think
it's<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.580> a<00:00:33.270> pretty<00:00:33.390> stellar<00:00:33.660> line-up<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it's a it's a pretty stellar line-up I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.960 
it's a it's a pretty stellar line-up I
believe<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:35.220> superior<00:00:35.520> than<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> one

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
believe it's much superior than the one

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000 
believe it's much superior than the one
that<00:00:36.120> best<00:00:36.270> retouch<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.750> ever<00:00:36.900> lay<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.740> onto

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that best retouch can ever lay out onto

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
that best retouch can ever lay out onto
the<00:00:38.100> pitch<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.880> I<00:00:38.910> definitely<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the pitch so I definitely see that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.140 
the pitch so I definitely see that
Arsenal<00:00:40.710> should<00:00:40.860> outperform<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:42.060> she

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
Arsenal should outperform that she

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.640 
Arsenal should outperform that she
touched<00:00:42.390> today<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.810> usually<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.380> not<00:00:43.560> the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
touched today but usually that's not the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.550 
touched today but usually that's not the
case<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:44.390> Arsenal<00:00:45.390> usually<00:00:45.780> played<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
case as a Arsenal usually played down to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.280 
case as a Arsenal usually played down to
the<00:00:47.010> other<00:00:47.190> teams<00:00:47.520> levels<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.330> if<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.230> just

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
the other teams levels so if we can just

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.990 
the other teams levels so if we can just
come<00:00:49.560> out<00:00:49.680> firing<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.580> bring<00:00:50.790> up<00:00:50.880> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
come out firing and just bring up the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.990 
come out firing and just bring up the
intensity<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> come<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.290> in<00:00:52.500> 12<00:00:53.400> are<00:00:53.640> four

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
intensity and come out in 12 are four

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
intensity and come out in 12 are four
fronts<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.420> attacking<00:00:54.720> then<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.650> should<00:00:55.830> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
fronts and attacking then we should be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.360 
fronts and attacking then we should be
fine<00:00:56.160> um<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.650> people<00:00:58.890> were<00:00:58.980> calling<00:00:59.190> for
