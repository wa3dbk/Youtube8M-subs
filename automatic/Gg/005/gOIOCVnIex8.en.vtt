weapons<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> look<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.630> briefly

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
weapons which I kind of look at briefly

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
weapons which I kind of look at briefly
but<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.530> wouldn't<00:01:25.830> load<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.520> reason

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
but they wouldn't load for some reason

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.859 
but they wouldn't load for some reason
so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> can't<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.840> look

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so you can't really see what they look

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
so you can't really see what they look
like<00:01:28.250> anyways<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.850> her<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.720> hand

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
something called Queens wrath so we're

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
something called Queens wrath so we're
gonna<00:01:58.140> jump<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.799> my<00:01:59.040> inventory<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.850> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
gonna jump into my inventory here and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.990 
gonna jump into my inventory here and
look<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.649> Queen's<00:02:01.979> orders<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
look these are the Queen's orders and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.030 
look these are the Queen's orders and
what<00:02:03.540> these<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.439> doesn't<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.770> tell

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
what these are it doesn't really tell

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
what these are it doesn't really tell
you<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.700> emissions<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you but they are emissions you have to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.950 
you but they are emissions you have to
go<00:02:07.469> back<00:02:07.649> into<00:02:07.860> orbit<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
go back into orbit and then on the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.560 
go back into orbit and then on the
left<00:02:09.140> it'll<00:02:09.830> say<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.220> Queen's<00:02:10.550> wrath<00:02:11.000> he'll

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
left it'll say the Queen's wrath he'll

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.170 
left it'll say the Queen's wrath he'll
order<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:12.770> are<00:02:12.980> story<00:02:13.430> challenges

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
order and so these are story challenges

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.050 
order and so these are story challenges
that<00:02:14.300> are<00:02:14.450> randomized<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.730> they<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that are randomized and they have the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.120 
that are randomized and they have the
epic<00:02:17.450> modifier<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.080> them<00:02:18.560> they<00:02:18.740> are<00:02:18.770> very

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
epic modifier on them they are very

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.240 
epic modifier on them they are very
difficult<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.390> go<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
difficult and you have to go in and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.310 
difficult and you have to go in and
complete<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.630> I've<00:02:23.630> heard<00:02:23.870> rumors<00:02:24.080> but

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
complete it and I've heard rumors but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.560 
complete it and I've heard rumors but
I'm<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.610> exactly<00:02:25.880> sure<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.210> haven't<00:02:26.480> checked

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
I'm not exactly sure I haven't checked

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.360 
I'm not exactly sure I haven't checked
myself<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.860> some<00:02:28.040> pretty
