and I'm going to bypass it again on the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.090 
and I'm going to bypass it again on the
other<00:02:02.200> side<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.120> let's<00:02:04.120> see<00:02:04.979> continue<00:02:05.979> this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
other side and let's see continue this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.889 
other side and let's see continue this
line<00:02:06.370> come<00:02:06.640> back<00:02:06.850> around<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.259> look<00:02:08.530> at<00:02:08.649> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
line come back around and look at that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.460 
line come back around and look at that
it's<00:02:10.899> not<00:02:11.020> cool

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
it's not cool

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.320 
it's not cool
now<00:02:12.100> if<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> light<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.670> hitting<00:02:12.790> from<00:02:12.940> up<00:02:13.150> top

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
now if the light is hitting from up top

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.850 
now if the light is hitting from up top
this<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.020> casting<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.440> little<00:02:14.620> bit<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
this would be casting a little bit of a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.480 
this would be casting a little bit of a
shadow<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.420> same<00:02:16.900> thing<00:02:16.930> over<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:18.190> that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
shadow and same thing over here and that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.740 
shadow and same thing over here and that
makes<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.910> look<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.600> behind

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
makes it look like it's the one behind

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.260 
makes it look like it's the one behind
same<00:02:20.739> thing<00:02:21.010> was<00:02:21.130> underneath<00:02:21.370> his<00:02:21.580> trunk<00:02:22.060> here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
same thing was underneath his trunk here

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.890 
same thing was underneath his trunk here
see<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.959> would<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.770> shadow<00:02:24.459> being<00:02:24.910> cast<00:02:25.000> from

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
see it would be a shadow being cast from

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.729 
see it would be a shadow being cast from
that<00:02:26.080> tusk<00:02:26.770> Alice<00:02:27.700> put<00:02:27.850> his<00:02:27.970> ears<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.739> just

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that tusk Alice put his ears in just

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.100 
that tusk Alice put his ears in just
like<00:02:29.920> regular<00:02:30.489> elephants<00:02:31.030> little<00:02:31.810> detail

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
like regular elephants little detail

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.860 
like regular elephants little detail
inside<00:02:32.440> some<00:02:33.280> hairs<00:02:33.489> on<00:02:33.640> top<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
inside some hairs on top and then the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.330 
inside some hairs on top and then the
other<00:02:34.989> side<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.290> his<00:02:35.380> face<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.950> maybe<00:02:36.160> his

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
other side of his face and maybe his

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.240 
other side of his face and maybe his
other<00:02:36.580> ears<00:02:36.940> peeking<00:02:37.870> out<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.320> alright

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
other ears peeking out like that alright

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.800 
other ears peeking out like that alright
now<00:02:39.400> we're<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.910> define<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.390> shape<00:02:40.660> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
now we're going to define the shape a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.440 
now we're going to define the shape a
little<00:02:40.840> bit<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.440> over<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.010> oval<00:02:42.400> come<00:02:43.090> around

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
little bit go over that oval come around

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.540 
little bit go over that oval come around
and<00:02:43.810> stop<00:02:44.560> about<00:02:44.860> there<00:02:45.100> because<00:02:45.340> we're<00:02:45.459> gonna

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
and stop about there because we're gonna

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.610 
and stop about there because we're gonna
put<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.850> lot<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.090> hair<00:02:46.270> on<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.600> moment<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.350> let's

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
put a lot of hair on a moment now let's

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.479 
put a lot of hair on a moment now let's
put<00:02:47.830> his<00:02:47.920> legs<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.480> come<00:02:49.480> down<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:51.220> got<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
put his legs in come down and you got to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.130 
put his legs in come down and you got to
make<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.760> wider<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.390> bottom<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.989> looks

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
make it wider at the bottom so it looks

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.840 
make it wider at the bottom so it looks
like<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.440> supporting<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.040> big<00:02:54.280> fella

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
like it's supporting this big fella

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.449 
like it's supporting this big fella
just<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.959> that's<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.350> leg<00:02:56.560> other<00:02:57.280> ones

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
just like that that's one leg other ones

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.250 
just like that that's one leg other ones
in<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.700> back<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.209> makes<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.630> little<00:02:59.110> bit

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
in the back so it makes a little bit

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.759 
in the back so it makes a little bit
smaller<00:02:59.680> because<00:02:59.830> it's<00:03:00.070> seen<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.340> perspective

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
smaller because it's seen in perspective

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.380 
smaller because it's seen in perspective
the<00:03:02.769> one<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.070> foreground<00:03:03.280> again<00:03:03.820> down<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
the one on the foreground again down to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.170 
the one on the foreground again down to
here<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.549> one<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:06.880> same
