00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.730
 very good everyone I'm from here to 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.620
 present a new figure of life 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.080
 As you can see, it's basically 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.760
 this figure was back to index 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 setback but that extends with a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 around the thumb 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.239
 well I have already seen how is the requirement 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.949
 for this figure and says the name 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.570
 and I want you seen in the video 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.930
 you have to know how to make the return to the index 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.949
 backwards for that reason if you do not insist 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 figure and you do not know how to do it then leave 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.089
 watch this video and click on the first 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.100
 link the decision that comes the tutorial 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.620
 of this from that figure what is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.800
 is 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.809
 ok if you do not know how to do this you are not going to 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.850
 to be able to make this figure that I thought you 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.719
 right now 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.500
 it's worth saying that I'm going with the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.810
 application of this trick 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.300
 I'm not going to know how to do tutoring 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.160
 the turn when starting networks start it 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.880
 briefly but it's more more more 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.880
 simple 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.090
 this trick basically consists of the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.960
 next process do this but 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.100
 come this moment 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.680
 before concluding the turn upside down in 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.620
 instead of removing the thumb 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.870
 let's remove 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.550
 and obviously as I've seen on youtube 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.370
 It has to be followed because 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.430
 basically explained to us you have to use 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.390
 the moment an impulse that we carry here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.880
 to make that return that in fact not 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 it's a turn is a return segment 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 so to speak 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 and the closing sorry the conclusion this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.390
 moment is next and it is quite 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.909
 dangerous for the following reason 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 in the handle is forgiveness the handle 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.350
 it's not safe there comes the complication 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.120
 of this moment we are going to have to put 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 the four fingers here to basically 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.260
 until the typical time of basically 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.750
 drop the other hand can let 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.690
 is the knife on the other side and then do 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.520
 the team equipment clamp says maybe that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.320
 is what happens that normally until 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.860
 now we have always done it with the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.600
 safe handle and that's no problem 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.930
 then how to do so that it does not happen 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.930
 this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.620
 I do not know if you see it in my camera shit that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.150
 I have some mini cuts here 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.019
 this has to be done in most 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.349
 the butterflies are like that but in the thread of 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:59.150
 what you cut is not since the beginning of 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.159
 sheet here up always always 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.739
 have a space and insurance and as you see 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.769
 here for example this version 42 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.090
 they were not horns were not typical 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.980
 when typical nets do not have leaves 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.140
 they have but of those series and we're already 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.870
 laughing but then there is a small tooth 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.920
 additional is like a security 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.099
 and then en masse and as a thing that 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.540
 put in that again here is 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
 difficult to design because it is so small 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.770
 although with herbs filled with another 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.860
 works easier 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:36.050
 is this part of here does not cut is to say 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.270
 from here here does not cut then what 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.250
 we have to do 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.020
 when we put all four fingers in this 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.060
 we have to put them in the handle 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.950
 as high as possible so that when 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.940
 rest the knife 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.940
 our our finger will not be in 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.190
 contact with the part that cuts 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.190
 what can we do quietly 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.810
 as high as possible 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.250
 Anyway, today I repeat it's something that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.010
 I do it is an extreme evidence and 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.690
 have the sharp knife as much as possible 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.000
 let's make these fucking cuts 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.709
 that my camera is a shit like that but it's 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.540
 that just in because they are not cuts of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.720
 nothing 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.630
 having said that, I recommend that you do not 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.920
 do with a kimura in burgos point out 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.729
 another knife because the kimura in the part 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.059
 that cuts already starts at this level 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.990
 which sorry this what is here says 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:44.029
 that the only safe area from here here 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.620
 which is one is a minor route 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:48.120
 then this trick was not advised 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.969
 do it as last but do it 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.879
 with a low type does not have to be 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.830
 a version 42 but having an area 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:00.790
 sure then bigger no where 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.290
 fit the surface of the index finger 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.940
 and in a small recapitulative important 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.990
 we start with the return to the index to 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.680
 reverse 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.300
 we put on top we do so we do not remove 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.040
 the thumb we put our hand here and the finger 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 index as high as possible so that we 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:26.010
 let's cut this down and put it on 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.010
 to yes the trick 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.319
 for those who are not comfortable a given 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.180
 I get on top of the bed for his handling 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.039
 what I'm not used to 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.620
 around football, it is 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.300
 pretty simple 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.150
 you can make a separate moment that is 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.590
 taking the safe handle here is worth it and 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.590
 basically turn it around 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.480
 if you do not want to do at the beginning 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.840
 used to the backhand 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.120
 forgiveness around the thumb 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.280
 without the fear of cutting you can be 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.640
 a little slow now instead of taking the 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.750
 command the montgÃ³ is sure ok to be 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:12.620
 Unsafe is worth this is pretty much easier 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.070
 and you practice this mango movement 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.040
 safe 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:21.450
 back to this but remember that in 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.950
 this trick of the good spin the trick 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.200
 who is teaching here because you have 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.849
 what to do from the safe handle 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.569
 and remember to put your index finger 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.039
 here so it's not cost worth 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.719
 makes it very simple and master the lap 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.610
 around starting networks and doing 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.589
 extensions is and nothing to remember 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.959
 put your index finger as high as possible 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:46.289
 of the mango to get cut and that's 

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:49.909
 all 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.909
 thanks for looking and even professional
