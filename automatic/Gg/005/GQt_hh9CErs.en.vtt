00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.660

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.250
 we have a few a post on the channel 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.660
 with these with these envelopes but I wanted 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.400
 recommend everyone to buy them well 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.619
 because you are already seeing the amount of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.480
 good letters that come out in the last 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.800
 collection that has come out and good the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.570
 true that if you have to buy from 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.939
 some buyer of this because I do not 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250
 you are going to regret it is much easier 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.350
 that this in good letters in these 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.050

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.370
