00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the extra typhlosion but for now I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
great for restroom because that means
you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> run<00:01:50.729> even<00:01:51.030> fewer<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.930> still

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you can run even fewer of them and still

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
you can run even fewer of them and still
be<00:01:52.470> able<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> realize<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.390> run<00:01:54.600> 12

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
be able to realize them again you run 12

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
be able to realize them again you run 12
fire<00:01:55.079> which<00:01:55.350> i<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> great<00:01:55.979> number<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
fire which i think is a great number a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
fire which i think is a great number a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
total of fourteen energy and a deck like

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
total of fourteen energy and a deck like
this<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.189> requires<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this that requires you to do a lot of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200 
this that requires you to do a lot of
discarding<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.939> manipulating<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.060> your

discarding and manipulating with your
energy<00:02:03.540> i<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> excellent<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
five cards for searching out basics

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.380 
five cards for searching out basics
three<00:02:07.439> collector<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.129> two<00:02:08.399> doable<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
three collector and two doable if you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.059 
three collector and two doable if you
really<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.989> high<00:02:10.200> number<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.619> basic

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
really want a high number of basic

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
really want a high number of basic
searchers<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:11.940> go<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.270> straight<00:02:12.660> for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
searchers I would go to a straight for

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
collect
but<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.370> you'll<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.550> fine<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:15.030> three

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
but I think you'll be fine with three

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610 
but I think you'll be fine with three
collector<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.810> dropping<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> duel<00:02:16.380> ball

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
collector and dropping the duel ball

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.820 
collector and dropping the duel ball
altogether<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.110> few<00:02:19.260> other<00:02:19.440> cards<00:02:19.770> I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
altogether there are a few other cards I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.199 
altogether there are a few other cards I
think<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.130> need<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.400> added<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.000> deck

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
think that need to be added to this deck

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.490 
think that need to be added to this deck
that<00:02:21.390> could<00:02:21.510> easily<00:02:21.870> take<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> prep<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that could easily take the prep the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.770 
that could easily take the prep the
place<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.860> those<00:02:22.980> two<00:02:23.160> duel<00:02:23.340> balls<00:02:23.780> since

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
place of those two duel balls since

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.990 
place of those two duel balls since
you're<00:02:24.990> running<00:02:25.230> three<00:02:25.530> typhlosion<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.670> also

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you're running three typhlosion you also

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.809 
you're running three typhlosion you also
run<00:02:27.180> three<00:02:27.540> rare<00:02:27.720> candy<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.800> also<00:02:29.100> run<00:02:29.459> 3

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
run three rare candy but you also run 3

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.760 
run three rare candy but you also run 3
junk<00:02:30.060> arms<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.510> might<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.989> safe<00:02:31.230> dropping

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
junk arms so you might be safe dropping

run<00:02:34.620> three<00:02:34.890> communication<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:35.700> i<00:02:35.819> think<00:02:35.880> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
run three communication which i think is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.820 
run three communication which i think is
