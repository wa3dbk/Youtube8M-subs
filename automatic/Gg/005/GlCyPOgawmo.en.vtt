00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.170
 the principle behind it 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.590
 moc Nahla fact of rhetoric 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.650
 Ingo Vogel 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 means racer and bestselling author 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 I get from my side 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.859
 here in beautiful Hamburg 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 at the congress of the idea exchange of the German post AG 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.759
 we're all in the same boat and that's why I'm going to put him one now 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.640
 exciting question 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.150
 do it once 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.220
 as if one or one of them 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.460
 have the pleasurable task right away 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.940
 here demand to give a lecture 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 It always goes through how they would probably do that best 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.890
 they remember the theme is 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 in the Motion Allah sales region corner 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.360
 and what exactly is that? 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.590
 I would have her 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 as they already explain to me, I will try 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.970
 as you can already see the name are 3 fascinating 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.310
 Ingredients in it 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.840
 in motion all sales has Oracle 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 to do 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.080
 in motion 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.520
 has to do 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 sell with 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 has to do with rhetoric 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 Do not know what 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 that's pretty much the order of priorities 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 I just have exciting experience I'm just over the aisle in the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.750
 Hall 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.540
 Unknown gentlemen also saw there for the three best marketing ideas 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090
 investigated 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.450
 He wanted to tell me the bay window 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 we are now fully assured of the same exciting talk 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.940
 and you look if smiling to him now to build such a relationship 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.070
 Recognize later 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 and if they can do that because Eckert 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 he says that sometimes the many people call Helsinki this is a memorial topic 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.780
 we can not do that now 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.250
 I'd have me, I dare to go on stage 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.660
 The main goal and have the previous speaker so beautiful always 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.089
 shown again 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.069
 reach the customer 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.650
 that's what it's all about, everything else is my work 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.169
 so 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.669
 Anyway, and we would soon see how they explain that to me 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.650
 if we have established a relationship then I'm into the culprit I have one 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.919
 bit stopped and there I go now you go back to whole 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 was good off before Buyten Schupbacher 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.139
 again cards 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.809
 Weissensee and that is now the customer relationship 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.079
 and that's what the motion is about, but selling the Toreck, that is 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.179
 we have three different priorities here 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.309
 the emotion is the cause 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.939
 We'll see why the cause for everything they are planning 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.559
 In the end, that's what it looks like 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.769
 we are somehow somewhere and someday 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.619
 all sellers 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.619
 that's why comes next because that's our goal 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.689
 is he gone 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.469
 and I'll tell them the same Reto that we understood today as well 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.909
 nothing more to do with beautiful talk with stilted put 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.229
 a blessing with Aigner 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.029
 testify 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.319
 Effect
