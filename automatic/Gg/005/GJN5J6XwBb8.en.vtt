00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
up there but I thought that was kind of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.880 
up there but I thought that was kind of
funny<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.480> didn't<00:01:57.750> realize<00:01:58.050> until<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.440> watched

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
funny I didn't realize until I watched

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.620 
funny I didn't realize until I watched
the<00:01:59.130> video<00:01:59.340> after<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.850> long<00:01:59.910> was<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.510> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
the video after how long was on the
ground<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.620> thought<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.550> from<00:02:02.640> like

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
ground I I thought I got that from like

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
ground I I thought I got that from like
the<00:02:03.420> kobo<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.990> something<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.590> but

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the kobo for something like that but

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.080
