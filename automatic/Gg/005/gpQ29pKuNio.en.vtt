00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.660
 a certain point where cougars still 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.369
 could go up in the general table and 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.400
 Atlantean looked so close to 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.109
 worthy way this matches and close of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.369
 worthy way and add points that what 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.619

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.179

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.480
 same minute 21 goatherd see the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.489
 Atlantean defense is there are some that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.340
 this is not turning my back on my being 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.770
 I was crouching, nobody was looking for a 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.960
 Coverage takes longer to react 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.320
 humans cabrera takes advantage very well takes out 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.789
 powerful shot and 1 by 0 very easy 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.649
 in this match 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.379
 the atlantean did not react with this 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.740
 shot of the ribei that passed near 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.580
 the goal defended by alcalá dona 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.330
 upset with 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.430
 score of 10 finished the first part 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.570
 this is already in the second half that one 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.190
 he stays with ten men for the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.620
 exclusion of quintana and in this 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.710
 light kickback Garcia who had entered 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.600
 of change puts the 2 for 0 is a left-handed 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 golazo 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.830
 of espanyol a great move by tuba 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.600
 they knew how to take the ball on their own 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.130
 territory and they reach the line of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.770
 fund up to four college students and 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.229
 putting the pointers exactly and this 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.070
 it is good annotation by a 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.290
 shot first 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.690
 what's up there that perfectly fits well 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.229
 you like the reception and good 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.490
 Save Alexander the palaces Pikolín 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.860
 really attentive and saving the hatch 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.860
 here this van rankin error that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.979
 clears everything in the center of the goal 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.290
 that makes manners is the sensational is a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.390
 golazo for la france were the minutes 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.119
 where pumas was really looking 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.730
 the third entry with which good 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.430
 Well, no 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.290
 they would go up to sixth place to sixth place and 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.860
 would move that the function of the table 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.360
 for the classification 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.250
 this is all happened near the goal 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.070
 this auction is robin ramírez in the hand 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.080
 very close to the post attends accounts not 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.790
 another pumas opportunity came 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.170
 robin again going from the side 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.040
 the right takes the shot and villalpando 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 it's a great save 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.230
 on the part of atlantean we said finish 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.090
 as the worst team in the tournament when 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.820
 we are looking at the last options here 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.650
 a good proven in a good service 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.570
 looking for the goal at the end of accounts 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.260
 interpose and it will be to avoid the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 fall from its frame we said that atlante 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.670
 it was the last place in the ranking 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.670
 will really be starting
