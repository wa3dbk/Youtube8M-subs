00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
I do run with the impacts just because

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.979 
I do run with the impacts just because

whereas<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.660> know<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.930> meanies<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
whereas you know the meanies and the

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.110 
whereas you know the meanies and the
impacts<00:03:21.040> you're<00:03:21.220> gonna<00:03:21.310> have<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.670> use<00:03:21.790> both

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
impacts you're gonna have to use both

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.360 
impacts you're gonna have to use both
and<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:22.780> playing<00:03:23.080> support<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.920> have<00:03:24.130> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
and then playing support you do have a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.199 
and then playing support you do have a
lot<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.820> frags<00:03:25.390> as<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.900> result<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> ammo<00:03:26.680> box

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
lot of frags as a result of the ammo box

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.360 
lot of frags as a result of the ammo box
but<00:03:28.209> then<00:03:28.390> again<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.720> only<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:29.080> one<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.560> so

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
but then again you only get one and so

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.310 
but then again you only get one and so
that's<00:03:31.269> why<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.510> don't<00:03:31.630> really<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:32.049> it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
that's why I don't really use it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.600 
that's why I don't really use it
