00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720
"All non-essential personnel..."

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.880
Good morning, Captain Grif.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.560
Hey.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.400
Good morning, Captain Grif!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.040
Yeah.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.780
Oh, oh! Captain Grif!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.740
[sigh]

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.920
Yes, Matthews?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.920
Hey! Uh, uh... I just wanted to say, uh, thanks again for
everything you and the other Reds and Blues did for us.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.520
If you guys hadn't shut down that
radio jammer we'd be dead!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.100
Gosh Matthews, I really appreciate that!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.840
Almost as much as I did the other 
FIFTY-SIX TIMES YOU THANKED ME!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.820
Oh good, I was worried it might start 
to come off as annoying.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.520
It does.  That was sarcasm.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.900
Just gonna repress that!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.480
What?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.180
Oh, Captain Grif! Uh, good to see you,
I wanted to thank you for -

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.600
Ugghh.... Look, do you know where Kimball is?
I need to talk to her.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.940
Kimball? I'm pretty sure I saw her
in the Armory a little while ago...

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.280
Great, thanks.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.320
Do you need an escort?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.020
NO!

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.040
All right, explain to me again,
why do you need a 50 calibre chain-gun?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880
Because I'm a gun-man?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.140
Yeah, I know, I get that, you keep saying that.
I mean, why do you need it right now?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.060
Hey, G-Man, hurry up!

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.640
Well, I mean, how else are people gonna
know what I do around here?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.920
You're a soldier!

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.120
Everyone's a soldier! You shoot at people who shoot
at you, until one of you dies from all the shooting.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.520
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Without my big gun
I just look like all the regular soldiers.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.860
No you don't, you've got white armor and red stripes!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.940
Ugh, and they're just awful! I'm thinking we go bold,
maybe red armour with white stripes.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.080
Huh?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.880
Donut, just because you're in charge of uniforms doesn't
mean you get to redecorate the entire army.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.700
Besides, that would completely ruin his camouflage.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.120
What camouflage?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.160
Huh... good point. How the hell
have you not been shot yet?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.920
What?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.320
It's 'cause the New Republic can't aim for shit!

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.660
Wanna say that to my face, punk?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.360
Hey, cut it out! The Armoury is no place for violence.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.620
Now calm down, or I'm not going to give you a gun.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.720
He started it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.360
Outta my way, captain on deck, official officer business.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.020
Grif, what do you want? Can't you see we're busy?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.680
Where's Kimball?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.340
I don't know, where were you during training this morning?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.440
Where do you guys train again?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.780
In the training room!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.920
Oh, right, yeah. Literally anywhere but there.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.740
Well I think I heard Miss Kimball was inspecting
the troops over there a little while ago.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.120
Oh man, really?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.700
Lopez, I don't speak Spanish.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.920
I have never spoken Spanish.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800
Yeah, get with the times and just assimilate!

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.240
See you, dickheads.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.080
Do you really think my stripes are awful?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.560
Lieutenant Palomo!

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.860
Yes, Agent Washington, Sir?

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.460
Explain to me how, in light of your recent promotion, you've somehow managed to become worse...

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.540
...at target practice.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.680
Uh, because the newly-added pressure of my rank
makes me second-guess my actions more frequently
in hopes I won't let down my fellow peers.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.720
WELL I DON'T...

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.940
Oh.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.040
Uhm, I mean, that's... understandable, lieutenant.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.800
Also, I've been trying to make a smiley face
 for, like, nine minutes.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.400
Nailed it.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.260
Wash!

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.780
[sighs]
Now what?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.460
Where's Kimball?

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.560
Oh, Captain Grif. How nice of you to join us,
we missed you at practice this morning.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.660
Yeah. That's probably because I wasn't there.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.220
So you weren't.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.060
Which is why everyone is going to give me three laps around the training facility.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.640
Get moving.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.360
You're punishing them?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.760
Remedial training. Disciplining the group
for the actions of a single soldier,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.700
...leads to social pressures that typically result
in the hasty correction of undesirable behaviour.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.420
Classic military strategy.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.200
Thanks a lot, fuck face!

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.240
So, are you ready to begin today's training?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.080
Uh... no?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.980
All right then, let's make it four laps!

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.920
"I'm gonna have an asthma attack!"

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.620
How're you feeling now?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.160
I feel like this military is fucking weird.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.940
FIVE LAPS!

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.000
[groans]

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.120
Man, this is the best punishment ever!

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.760
What do you need Kimball for anyway?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.480
She's in the middle of a meeting with Doyle.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.600
So she's in the war room?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.880
I... wait wait wait, no! You're not going anywhere until -

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.760
Sorry dude, gotta go. Just keep punishing the rebels
some more, I'm sure I'll learn my lesson.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.100
God damn it.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.580
Whoa, well, we sure showed him.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.560
I don't care if your men prefer it, the fact of the matter is
we are going to run out of ammunition faster.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.980
But you're not taking the statistical
advantage into account.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.460
Yes, the standard issue assault rifle has a
firing rate of 15 rounds per second.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.220
But if those rounds are being fired at the enemy,
then that means we have 15 chances to kill the enemy
every time we pull the trigger!

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.900
Without our mercenaries bring in supplies
we need to make every bullet count.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.480
Are you doubting my soldiers' skill in the battlefield?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.540
I am doubting so much more than that.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.180
Miss Kimball, it has been over a month since we began this truce,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.840
...and there is yet to be a single day
where you have not tested its strength.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.780
Well that's probably because I don't like you!

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.500
Hey!

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.980
We've got a problem!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.840
Is it tan with a blue visor?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.900
Now I'm what most people would
probably consider a hero.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.440
Like a fire fighter, or the guy that invented
the microwave, or, uh... the Oreo dude.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.780
Oh-kay...

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.220
So what I want to know is why a hero, like myself, is not allowed to have...

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.640
SECOND HELPINGS IN THE MESS HALL!

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.980
Uh, uhm...

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.860
Because we're low on food.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.200
Oh, so you have the common sense to
ration our meals but not our ammo?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.620
That is hardly relevant.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.840
Hardly relevant?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.360
Hey, I know you guys are having a hard time playing
nice, but there are bigger things at stake right now.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.040
Get out.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.440
Like steak, for instance!

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.480
Get out!

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.500
We need bigger ones!

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.440
Grif! Leave! Now!

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.480
So, are we just going to put a pin in this or -

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.160
Oh my God! Won't someone just put him
on dish duty for the rest of the day!

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.800
What?!

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.820
Come on, sir. Let's go.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.120
This is some bullshit!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.700
Can we just talk about something else for a minute?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.140
Well, the reason I originally came to speak with you,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.500
...was to inform you of the status of our
men's most recent assault.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.860
Wait, they radioed in? What happened?

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.840
Well...

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.040
♫ Duh, duh, duh ♫

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.600
What?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.380
♫ Another one bites the dush, oh yeah! ♫

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.580
♫ And another one gone, ♫ 
- Word!

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.900
♫ Another one gone ♫ 
- Uh!

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.000
♫ Another one bites the dust, oh yeah! ♫

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.560
♫ Ooh! ♫

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.060
♫ We ♫

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.580
♫ Kicked ♫

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.100
♫ Your ♫

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.640
♫ Ass ♫

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.240
Bitch!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.220
Get down wit' your bad self!

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.720
All right.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.760
That's enough.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.660
We just took their base, no need for cruel
and unusual punishment.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.020
You sure? I could drop some sick beats on 'em. 
You know, bust some rhymes, make it old-school.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.220
Oh for God's sakes, please don't.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.140
Huh... square.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.860
Come on, let's get this place sorted out.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.540
Intel says they were keeping some
Freelancer equipment here.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.400
Right, Sarge, why don't you go check on the feds? 
Tucker, are you down to handle the rebels?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.640
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.860
In all the years we spent in the canyon,
when the hell did he learn to dance?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.460
I've got bigger questions on my mind right now.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.780
Yeah? Like what?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.680
Like what else was Charon studying out here?

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.220
What's up, forever alone?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.820
So, uh... you wanna do something with your life or you just wanna sit around on your ass all day like a loser?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.460
Yeah, me too!

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.980
So, uh... just subscribe and keep watching YouTube.
It's way easier.
