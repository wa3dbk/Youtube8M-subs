 the man was doing

 I was hoping that some company 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.090
 There is nothing to do 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090
 stressed that we are calm 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 since when 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.500
 we started 3 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.450
 we begin to see what happens 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.450
 the next step has passed about 3 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.190
 it's a project that is fusion 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 we talk about what reggae music is 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
 that is, I saw 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.140

 equally unique space for all the time 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.969
 we got together we always talked about his father 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.230
 we meet 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.350
 and one moment to another as we are now 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.700
 to create temple we begin to so many inc 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 they pay me a fixed fee 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.770
 and as planned there will be an exhibition 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.570
 between the different styles from the beginning in the same problem and with the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.170
 rest 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.910
 few 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.249
 the sector is still against I am not even buying one for oneself 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.550
 we had to change quite the French people to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.790
 He was definitely a driver 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.040
 it's never 11% 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.490
 in the absence of being located the self-employed and thus was perplexed the

 kawasaki that they expand 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460

 The movie 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.209
 posed us 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.579

 its clear sign of genocide 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.889
 are the hydraulic conditions 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.879

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.399
 the variety we have about 14 hours 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.609
 eleven of which 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.689

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.769
 celebrities for 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.119
 the perfect score 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.099
 we are the creators and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.699
 you have to do 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.759
 they do not pay too little 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.979

 comas who years ago 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.879
 andy murray as the only use of the network and 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.850
 i just saw that yes 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.460

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.419
 of his thrusts branch of that song the silent hill imiten 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.649
 involve all the people who leave and it is like that and if the day is enough 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.769
 and that's what happened to us in life here we try to inculcate 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.510
 the girls tendinitis towers and know the real 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.640
 it worked with 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.369
 a touch and adventure activity 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.809
 patient 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:17.579
 motivates essential how much time spent despite that through girls 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.889
 He spent the time and money granted him the center of the country 55 percent minardi 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.139
 but the other day forget about the environment an application was made 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.009
 friendship and josefina in the most important areas in assets 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.270
 allows you to capture that country of people 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.490
 the cathedral is an ideal 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.800
 but the incidental actions 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.150
 two jackson brothers 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.090
 your inspiration in our 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.080
 while the sector lives 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.979
 some group or artificial agrarian died in 2002 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.099
 in the final bars 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 we will finish the institutional investors 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.300
 the left 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.680
 that will reinforce that is our commitment to the cinema 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.110
 first of all I like it and the truth that 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.639
 Meanwhile 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.039
 that own style chain jumping 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.559
 a little bit of each halter style later 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.159
 I have requested 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 we pass affects those that have serious 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.109
 ChÃ¡vez defended his innocence and assured that proposals 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.909
 in that trajectory united states also

 idesa buenos aires on the toque 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.210
 there are good proposals and you have to analyze it but I think the interblock 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.430
 will play casting 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.010
 However, as we have always been 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.170
 and also in the south in different provinces do not do our purpose 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.949
 of beds in a short film 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.289
