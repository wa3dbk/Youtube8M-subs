00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.620
 in the last championship everyone saw me 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.270
 absolutely by chance he did not win but I know 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.189
 what am I 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.189
 much stronger than you as investors like 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.449
 fighter 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.810
 now quite a simple way 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.910
 I call you any competition 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 arm wrestling 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.300
 and when you go r 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 I will prove my readiness 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.390
 it's just nothing 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 in the company of rolkan you 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.479
 miner 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.479
 i will unite 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 rate increase for this purpose 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.679
 I think that if you try 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.919
 so i don't have 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.629
 and I have long 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.389
 home to mom 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.549
 to give extra 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.769
 stimulus 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.769
 you will choose 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.049
 I believe that 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.609
 why do we ourselves
