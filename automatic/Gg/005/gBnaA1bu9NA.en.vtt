that I wanted to do to eliminate the

that I wanted to do to eliminate the
rods<00:00:32.420> that<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:34.100> usually<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.030> a

lot of your crawlers as you can see I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
lot of your crawlers as you can see I
built<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.399> put<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> servo<00:00:42.410> per<00:00:43.410> wheel<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:46.309> just

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
built I put a servo per wheel and just

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
built I put a servo per wheel and just
mounted<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:49.100> stock<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.629> max<00:00:51.899> T<00:00:52.289> max<00:00:52.530> a

you can see it or not that for the shock
mounts<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.500> outer<00:01:04.799> ear<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.400> cut<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> off<00:01:06.180> for

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
mounts that outer ear I cut it off for

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.060 
mounts that outer ear I cut it off for
clearance<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.189> did<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.060> four

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
clearance and I did that on all four

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
clearance and I did that on all four
corners<00:01:16.070> same<00:01:17.070> way<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
corners same way and it actually it's a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.330 
corners same way and it actually it's a
pretty<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:23.040> setup<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:24.210> running<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.340> pack

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pretty good setup I'm running a pack

that I modified for sale pack I modified

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.620 
that I modified for sale pack I modified
it<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:30.049> accept<00:01:31.049> five<00:01:31.320> sales<00:01:32.210> add<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.450> another

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it to accept five sales add in another

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
it to accept five sales add in another
sale<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:35.520> also<00:01:35.729> running<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
sale to it and I'm also running the if I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.260 
sale to it and I'm also running the if I
can<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.210 

I<00:01:46.689> can<00:01:47.689> get<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.960> close<00:01:48.200> let<00:01:48.530> me<00:01:48.649> sketch<00:01:48.979> it

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
I can get that close let me sketch it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.840 
I can get that close let me sketch it
here<00:01:49.460> -<00:01:49.729> here<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.570> go

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
here - here we go

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.200 
here - here we go
it's<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:53.320> Futaba<00:01:54.320> uh<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:55.759> what<00:01:55.970> they<00:01:56.060> use

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
it's a Futaba uh it's like what they use

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.670 
it's a Futaba uh it's like what they use
on<00:01:56.240> airplanes<00:01:56.570> it'll<00:01:57.439> run<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:58.030> four<00:01:59.439> servos<00:02:00.439> off

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
on airplanes it'll run a four servos off

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.460 
on airplanes it'll run a four servos off
of<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.360> well<00:02:02.360> actually<00:02:02.539> more<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.930> guess<00:02:03.259> if<00:02:03.380> you

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
of it well actually more I guess if you

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.510 
of it well actually more I guess if you
want<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.740> use<00:02:03.890> splitters<00:02:04.600> but<00:02:05.950> it's<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.100> pretty

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
want to use splitters but it's a pretty

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
want to use splitters but it's a pretty
good<00:02:07.700> setup<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.239> allows<00:02:08.509> trimming<00:02:09.050> for<00:02:09.200> each

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
good setup it allows trimming for each

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.900 
good setup it allows trimming for each
servo<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.870> say<00:02:12.050> I'm<00:02:12.200> running<00:02:12.380> five<00:02:13.099> sails

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
servo like I say I'm running five sails

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.509 
servo like I say I'm running five sails
on<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.510> I'm<00:02:14.569> usually<00:02:14.780> running

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
on it and I'm usually running

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.940 
on it and I'm usually running
rechargeable<00:02:16.519> batteries<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.799> just<00:02:18.799> throw

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
rechargeable batteries but I just throw

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.990 
rechargeable batteries but I just throw
these<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.310> because<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.519> didn't<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.850> any

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
these in because I didn't have any

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.210 
these in because I didn't have any
charged<00:02:20.420> at<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> time<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:24.560> my<00:02:24.860> battery

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
charged at the time so now my battery

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.770 
charged at the time so now my battery
mount<00:02:25.940> it'll<00:02:26.269> lift<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:28.519> back<00:02:28.850> hit<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.630> off

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
mount it'll lift this back hit it off

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.250 
mount it'll lift this back hit it off
accept<00:02:30.519> just<00:02:31.519> any<00:02:31.670> stick<00:02:32.030> pack<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.630> use<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.049> lot

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
accept just any stick pack I use a lot

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.979 
accept just any stick pack I use a lot
of<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> cheaper<00:02:34.209> stick<00:02:35.209> packs<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
of the cheaper stick packs with it

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.039 
of the cheaper stick packs with it
because<00:02:37.060> they're<00:02:38.060> good<00:02:38.239> for<00:02:38.390> crowling<00:02:38.870> when

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
because they're good for crowling when

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.140 
because they're good for crowling when
they're<00:02:39.200> wore<00:02:39.410> out<00:02:39.590> about<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:40.730> no<00:02:40.970> good

they're wore out about it and no good
for<00:02:41.330> other<00:02:41.480> things<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.099> an<00:02:43.190> adapter

for other things and I have an adapter

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.940 
for other things and I have an adapter
