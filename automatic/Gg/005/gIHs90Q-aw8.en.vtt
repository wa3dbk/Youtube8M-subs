Mary<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> follow<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> dam<00:01:16.490> be<00:01:17.490> able<00:01:17.789> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
Mary as you follow the dam be able to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
Mary as you follow the dam be able to
see<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.359> as<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.659> turn<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:22.049> may<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
see it as we turn it may not be a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
see it as we turn it may not be a
hundred<00:01:22.829> percent<00:01:22.920> accurate<00:01:23.280> however<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.149> think

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
hundred percent accurate however I think

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.910 
hundred percent accurate however I think
