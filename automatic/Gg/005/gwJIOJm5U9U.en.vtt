00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 you fly to the deepest part where 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.740
 are the fish and then later 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.190

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.350

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:30.070
 that I proposed to work on it and not 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.070

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.169
 very well 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.240
 Hi, I'm Dr. Scott and I'm 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.300
 paleontologist can you tell what kind of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.930
 animal are tiny shiny iron pteranodon 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.069
 they were do pteranodon if they are all 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.719
 pteranodon is yes but one thing in 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.469
 Actually the trans or gifts were not 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.270
 dinosaurs 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:06.750
 but the pteranodon is flying with the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.820
 birds above the dinosaurs 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.940
 you know what it was that to the pteranodon 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.460
 is they liked to eat more 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.920
 Alter Don did not love the fish and 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.820
 you know some current flying animal that 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.890
 eat fish and we think the pelican 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.440
 fishing almost in the same way as 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.240
 did the pteranodon is they dive in 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.810
 the water from the air and catch the 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.570
 fish with its long beak 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.150
 Create a dive but remember to go out 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.110
 outside enjoy nature and 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.110
 discover many things 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.240
 you knew that wine travels to all 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.460
 places in the mesozoic era look from 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.970
 map had the Triassic periods 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.100
 Jurassic and Cretaceous we visited the 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.590
 Jurassic was a hot and humid climate 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.360
 full of forests and forests the first 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.250
 well-known birds and many of the 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.580
 bigger dinosaurs like 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.650
 Stegosaurs lived in the Jurassic and 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.860
 that's just one of the stops that 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.610
 we will do in the train video 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.740
 tiny tune and that means 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.740
