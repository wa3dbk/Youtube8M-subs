really ways the pancake down so we need

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.900 
really ways the pancake down so we need

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
to fluff them up with the egg whites and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.580 
to fluff them up with the egg whites and
this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.329> morning<00:00:51.690> workout

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so go to tone it up calm so we're just

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.930 
so go to tone it up calm so we're just
going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> mash<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.530> banana<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.700> just
