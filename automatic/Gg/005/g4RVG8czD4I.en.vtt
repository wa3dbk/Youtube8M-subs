00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.620 
I believe it's jay-ar ODB to one-to-one
so<00:00:23.279> he's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> one<00:00:24.060> who<00:00:24.119> comes<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.480> these

this an all men slider set but what

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260 
this an all men slider set but what

these<00:03:21.000> slightly<00:03:21.450> harder<00:03:21.750> than<00:03:21.870> all<00:03:22.019> Madden<00:03:22.290> is

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
these slightly harder than all Madden is

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.590 
these slightly harder than all Madden is
the<00:03:22.500> CPU<00:03:22.950> skill<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.430> most<00:03:23.970> all<00:03:24.150> Madden<00:03:24.420> slider

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the CPU skill on most all Madden slider

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.360 
the CPU skill on most all Madden slider
sets<00:03:24.900> you'll<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.500> CPU<00:03:25.680> skill<00:03:26.160> is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
sets you'll see that the CPU skill is

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.910 
sets you'll see that the CPU skill is
gonna<00:03:26.550> be<00:03:26.670> equal<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.630> player<00:03:28.170> skill<00:03:28.470> but

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
gonna be equal to the player skill but

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.500 
gonna be equal to the player skill but
in<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.100> one<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.430> actually<00:03:29.519> very<00:03:29.940> increased

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
in this one it's actually very increased

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.390 
in this one it's actually very increased
which<00:03:30.720> makes<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.080> made<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> lot<00:03:31.500> harder<00:03:31.739> not<00:03:32.370> a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
which makes it made a lot harder not a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.070 
which makes it made a lot harder not a
lot<00:03:32.610> harder<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.150> know<00:03:33.239> good<00:03:33.510> good<00:03:33.840> amount

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
lot harder but you know good good amount

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.020 
lot harder but you know good good amount
harder<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.620> then<00:03:35.040> if<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.220> use<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> black<00:03:35.700> set

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
harder and then if you use the black set

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
harder and then if you use the black set
for<00:03:36.209> these<00:03:36.330> sliders<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:37.110> know<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:38.100> most<00:03:38.250> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
for these sliders you know like most of

for these sliders you know like most of
the<00:03:38.459> stuffs<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> 90s<00:03:39.269> which<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.540> like

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
then a left quarter length is 11 minutes

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.199 
then a left quarter length is 11 minutes
with<00:03:55.110> minimum<00:03:55.590> play<00:03:55.800> clock<00:03:55.920> time<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.280> 15<00:03:56.730> 15

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.120 
with minimum play clock time is 15 15
seconds<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.470> what<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.680> slider<00:03:58.890> set

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
seconds that's what the slider set

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.650 
seconds that's what the slider set
recommends<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.670> might<00:03:59.850> bump<00:04:00.000> these<00:04:00.150> up<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.390> 12

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
recommends I might bump these up to 12

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.080 
recommends I might bump these up to 12
not<00:04:01.080> really<00:04:01.320> sure<00:04:01.500> yet<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:01.950> we'll<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.370> game

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
not really sure yet but we'll see game

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.420 
not really sure yet but we'll see game
speed<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.540> preffer<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.140> whatever<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:05.010> want<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
speed is preffer is whatever you want I

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.500 
speed is preffer is whatever you want I
think<00:04:05.459> I'm<00:04:05.670> gonna<00:04:05.760> turn<00:04:05.940> them<00:04:06.090> too<00:04:06.269> slow

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
think I'm gonna turn them too slow

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.430 
think I'm gonna turn them too slow
because<00:04:06.660> I've<00:04:06.810> heard<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:06.989> makes<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> lot

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
because I've heard it makes it a lot

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.490 
because I've heard it makes it a lot
more<00:04:07.500> realistic<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.880> I'll<00:04:08.940> put<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.209> there

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
more realistic so I'll put that there

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.900 
more realistic so I'll put that there
and<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.860> rest<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.430> stuff<00:04:11.700> is

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
and then the rest of this stuff is

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.560 
and then the rest of this stuff is
pretty<00:04:11.940> much<00:04:12.480> whatever<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.140> want<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.440> be

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
pretty much whatever you want it to be

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.259 
pretty much whatever you want it to be
yeah<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.340> then<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.609> want<00:04:17.760> Auto<00:04:17.940> strafe

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
yeah so and then you want Auto strafe

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.670 
yeah so and then you want Auto strafe
and<00:04:18.299> auto<00:04:18.540> sprint<00:04:18.840> off<00:04:19.049> those<00:04:19.410> are<00:04:19.530> another

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
and auto sprint off those are another

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.070 
and auto sprint off those are another
those<00:04:20.280> are<00:04:20.400> two<00:04:20.489> more<00:04:20.609> big<00:04:20.820> ones<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.989> yeah
