00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 Good day to all today I want to tell 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 how do i do such a framework for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.950
 honey comb or apparently use 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.400
 improvised materials I strongly not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.289
 I bother to use this frame 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.100
 such metal riveting 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.599
 well so that the wire does not crash within 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.029
 they look like this conventional riveting 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.219
 size 32 by eight items in the store 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.360
 it costs 15 rubles a pack of almost 50 pieces 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.960
 Immediately stretched the wire will 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 already directly in spring and summer 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.670
 before applying, well, I think with the help 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 were not behind the electro build up and on 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.110
 pieces of honeycomb paste should make 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.870
 Now I will show you how I do in advance 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.930
 These are the cooked rivers. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.950
 I soak them in the pipe 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.670
 accelerate not soak a long time before 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:16.380
 hold it over the forms somewhere well 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:19.890
 half a minute over each bend with a pipe 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 still easier threw in there for a couple of days 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.340
 put and then got use 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.340
 Now I will show you how I do it. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.870
 It turns out such a screen frame 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.050
 seems to be flimsy but when 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.360
 dry pretty stiff with reverse 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.600
 sides here cut out a little bit 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.010
 all ready 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.230
 if you do something to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.840
 like I would like to know how to get out 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 do it all good bye
