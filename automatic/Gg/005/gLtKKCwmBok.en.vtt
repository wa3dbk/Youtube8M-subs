00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
should be rt8 hands on and it could be

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
should be rt8 hands on and it could be
interesting<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.880> see<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.420> this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
interesting for you to see how this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
interesting for you to see how this
works<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:42.090> you

works so I'm just going to take you
through<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> equipment<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> need

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
through some of the equipment you need

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.549 
through some of the equipment you need
obviously<00:00:44.040> need<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.510> big<00:00:45.510> box<00:00:45.690> begin<00:00:46.170> T<00:00:46.350> box

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
obviously need a big box begin T box

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.790 
obviously need a big box begin T box
like<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> size<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> doesn't<00:00:49.559> matter

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
like this the size of it doesn't matter

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.380 
like this the size of it doesn't matter
because<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.879> hologram

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
because you can make this hologram

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.319 
because you can make this hologram
experience<00:00:52.460> as<00:00:53.460> big<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:53.940> I've

experience as big as you want I've

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.580 
experience as big as you want I've
chosen<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
chosen this one because we just have a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.729 
chosen this one because we just have a
microwave<00:00:55.920> delivered<00:00:57.469> I<00:01:00.140> have<00:01:01.140> some

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
microwave delivered I have some

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.029 
microwave delivered I have some
placemats<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:03.989> form<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
placemats here now this will form the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.469 
placemats here now this will form the
stage<00:01:05.549> area<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.409> hologram<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.360> what<00:01:09.360> we

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
going to be quite reflective bit like a
mirror<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.680> also<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.850> need<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.119> able<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
mirror but also you need to be able to

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.050 
mirror but also you need to be able to
see<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:07.049> well<00:02:07.519> now<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.579> reason

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
see through it as well now the reason

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
see through it as well now the reason
for<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.209> will<00:02:09.420> become<00:02:09.509> apparent<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.259> bit

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
for that will become apparent a bit

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
for that will become apparent a bit
later<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> basically<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.440> equipment

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
later on so basically with the equipment

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.790 
later on so basically with the equipment
you<00:02:13.920> need

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
you need

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.120 
you need
this<00:02:14.980> box<00:02:15.190> yeah<00:02:17.460> there<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.640> will<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:20.130> it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
this box yeah there you will see it's

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.740 
this box yeah there you will see it's
pretty<00:02:21.250> much<00:02:21.370> empty<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.940> got<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.270> there<00:02:25.480> is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
pretty much empty now got in there is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.220 
pretty much empty now got in there is
another<00:02:26.620> box<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.730> maybe<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> stage<00:02:28.810> area<00:02:29.050> a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
another box just maybe the stage area a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620 
another box just maybe the stage area a
little<00:02:29.410> bit<00:02:29.500> smaller<00:02:29.830> make<00:02:30.360> holes<00:02:31.360> around<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
little bit smaller make holes around a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.600 
little bit smaller make holes around a
bit<00:02:31.810> clearer<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:33.010> need<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.400> this

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
bit clearer you don't need to have this

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.910 
bit clearer you don't need to have this
because<00:02:34.450> everything<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.870> want<00:02:35.080> where<00:02:35.860> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
because everything you want where you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.130 
because everything you want where you
can<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.370> within<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.940> box<00:02:37.150> which<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:38.050> to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
can do within the box which we have to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.890 
can do within the box which we have to
see<00:02:38.320> there<00:02:38.560> there's<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> side<00:02:39.700> back<00:02:40.420> another

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
see there there's a side back another

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.380 
see there there's a side back another
side<00:02:41.230> now<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.430> side<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.820> back<00:02:42.970> I've<00:02:43.210> just

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
side now on that side and back I've just

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.510 
side now on that side and back I've just
got<00:02:43.540> white<00:02:43.780> sheets<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.230> paper<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.190> make

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
got white sheets of paper you can make

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.550 
got white sheets of paper you can make
your<00:02:45.670> own<00:02:45.700> scenery<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:47.080> make<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.410> bit

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
your own scenery just to make it a bit

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
your own scenery just to make it a bit
more<00:02:48.600> interesting<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.820> for<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.060> purposes<00:02:52.450> of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
more interesting but for the purposes of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.420 
more interesting but for the purposes of
today<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> simple

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
today I'm just going to have a simple

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.370 
today I'm just going to have a simple
setup<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.750> elaborate<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:56.140> this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
setup and you can elaborate on this

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.730 
setup and you can elaborate on this
yourself<00:02:56.770> later<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:58.000> within<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.450> box

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
yourself later so within this box

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.230 
yourself later so within this box
firstly<00:02:59.740> we're<00:02:59.860> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.070> place<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:01.030> stage

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.190 

I'm<00:03:07.240> also<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> put<00:03:07.960> in<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:09.000> mirror<00:03:10.200> oil

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I'm also going to put in the mirror oil

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.620 
I'm also going to put in the mirror oil
now<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.130> angle<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.730> put<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.240> is<00:03:13.420> very

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
now the angle you put this in is very

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.310 
now the angle you put this in is very
important

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
important

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.720 
important
you've<00:03:14.530> got<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.710> get<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.890> as<00:03:15.010> close<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.460> 45

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
you've got to get it as close to 45

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
you've got to get it as close to 45
degrees<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:17.500> possible<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.610> they'll

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
degrees like that as possible so they'll

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.850 
degrees like that as possible so they'll
put<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.120> box<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:20.080> front<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.590> stage

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
put it in the box in front of that stage

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.600 
put it in the box in front of that stage
area<00:03:21.660> at<00:03:22.660> 45<00:03:23.140> degrees<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.040> she's<00:03:24.280> pointing

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
area at 45 degrees so she's pointing

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.660 
area at 45 degrees so she's pointing
upwards<00:03:25.000> now<00:03:26.430> next<00:03:27.430> thing<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.610> do<00:03:27.730> shut<00:03:28.570> box

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
upwards now next thing you do shut box

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.229 
upwards now next thing you do shut box
right<00:03:30.670> now<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.459> make<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.790> stage<00:03:34.000> area

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
right now just to make the stage area

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.920 
right now just to make the stage area
completely<00:03:34.690> covered<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.130> dark<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.570> what

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
completely covered so it's dark and what

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.040 
completely covered so it's dark and what
we're<00:03:38.050> doing<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.380> adding<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:39.520> torch<00:03:40.050> here

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
we're doing is adding this torch here

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.430 
we're doing is adding this torch here
just<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.920> give<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.190> more<00:03:43.440> lifelike

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
just to give it a more lifelike

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.840 
just to give it a more lifelike
experience<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:46.330> like<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> stage<00:03:47.110> area

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
experience and to like the stage area

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.100 
experience and to like the stage area
that's<00:03:48.850> important<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.330> light<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> stage<00:03:49.810> area

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
that's important to light the stage area

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.550 
that's important to light the stage area
because<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.160> mattes<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.180> saw<00:03:52.360> inside<00:03:52.560> gives

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
because the mattes you saw inside gives

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.810 
because the mattes you saw inside gives
the<00:03:53.950> illusion<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.840> 3d<00:03:56.440> stage<00:03:57.070> without<00:03:57.459> that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
the illusion of a 3d stage without that

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.880 
the illusion of a 3d stage without that
or<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:58.120> look<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:58.720> an<00:03:59.020> image<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.770> screen

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
or just look like an image on the screen

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.800 
or just look like an image on the screen
so<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.730> do<00:04:00.880> need<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.180> light<00:04:01.360> up<00:04:01.540> an<00:04:01.630> area

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
so you do need to light up an area

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.960 
so you do need to light up an area
behind<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.440> screen<00:04:02.770> in<00:04:03.250> order<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.700> make<00:04:03.850> it

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
behind the screen in order to make it

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.540 
behind the screen in order to make it
look<00:04:04.090> realistic<00:04:05.760> next<00:04:06.760> stage<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:08.310> get<00:04:09.310> a

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
look realistic next stage is to get a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.020 
look realistic next stage is to get a
little<00:04:09.760> video<00:04:10.000> on<00:04:10.650> YouTube<00:04:11.650> which<00:04:12.580> will

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
little video on YouTube which will

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.870 
little video on YouTube which will
demonstrate<00:04:13.330> we<00:04:14.200> trying<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.830> do<00:04:15.040> here<00:04:15.310> if

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
demonstrate we trying to do here if

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.060 
demonstrate we trying to do here if
you're<00:04:16.060> recording<00:04:16.299> your<00:04:16.600> own<00:04:16.630> one<00:04:17.019> then<00:04:17.919> what

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
you're recording your own one then what

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.870 
you're recording your own one then what
you<00:04:18.160> need<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.430> do<00:04:18.609> is<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:19.720> film<00:04:20.500> yourself<00:04:20.880> with

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
you need to do is to film yourself with
