couple of DeMars y'all virtual vintages
next<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.359> that's<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
next to that that's going to the

Marshall that's running in a bedroom
volume<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.510> completely<00:00:25.080> clean<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.189> all

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
volume so it's completely clean so all

the<00:00:27.060> stuff<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.779> doing<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the stuff we're going to be doing is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
the stuff we're going to be doing is
coming<00:00:28.349> from<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> pedals<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> here's<00:00:30.210> what

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
coming from the pedals so here's what

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.360 
coming from the pedals so here's what
the<00:00:30.359> amp<00:00:30.510> sounds<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:37.850> okay<00:00:39.200> pedal<00:00:40.200> wise

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the amp sounds like okay pedal wise

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.830 
the amp sounds like okay pedal wise
we're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> cop<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.420> Eddie<00:00:42.570> did

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we're going to cop some what Eddie did

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
we're going to cop some what Eddie did
which<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.190> running<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> phase

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
which was you know running into a phase

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
which was you know running into a phase
90<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.800> he<00:00:46.950> ran<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.640> Echoplex<00:00:48.350> with

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
90 and then he ran into an Echoplex with

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950 
90 and then he ran into an Echoplex with
one<00:00:49.649> repeat<00:00:50.360> smacked<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> front<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> his

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
one repeat smacked in front of his

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.880 
one repeat smacked in front of his
Marshall<00:00:53.449> what<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Marshall what I'm going to do is use in

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
Marshall what I'm going to do is use in
phase<00:00:56.760> 90<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.859> reissue<00:00:58.859> ones

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
phase 90 this is one of the reissue ones

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.840 
phase 90 this is one of the reissue ones
and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:01.050> into<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:02.190> repeat<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and then that's going into one repeat of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
and then that's going into one repeat of
this<00:01:03.030> super<00:01:03.510> puss<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.049> using<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.470> like

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this super puss so we're using this like

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
this super puss so we're using this like
he<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.070> used<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.400> Echoplex<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
he would have used this Echoplex and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
he would have used this Echoplex and
then<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.380> getting<00:01:07.680> slammed<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.220> front<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
then that is getting slammed in front of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
then that is getting slammed in front of
the<00:01:08.909> sparkle<00:01:09.270> drive<00:01:09.450> mod<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> its<00:01:10.290> mod<00:01:10.830> number

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the sparkle drive mod in its mod number

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.390 
the sparkle drive mod in its mod number
three<00:01:11.400> setting<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:13.100> let's<00:01:14.100> hear<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
three setting so let's hear what that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.320 
three setting so let's hear what that
sounds<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.420> here's<00:01:17.000> mod<00:01:18.000> number

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sounds like for so here's mod number

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
sounds like for so here's mod number
three<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.979> completely<00:01:26.490> different

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
three now that's a completely different

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
three now that's a completely different
sounding<00:01:27.240> than<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:27.689> mod<00:01:28.229> number<00:01:28.590> one

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
sounding than let's say mod number one

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
sounding than let's say mod number one
which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> sort<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> fat<00:01:29.820> singing<00:01:30.270> lead

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
which is the sort of fat singing lead

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:42.460 
which is the sort of fat singing lead
sounds<00:01:31.009> let<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.070> show<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> difference

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.750 

nothing<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.829> guy<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.070> here

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.670 

so<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:49.330> actually<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.780> most<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.410> sound

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
so that actually is most of the sound

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.150 
so that actually is most of the sound
but<00:01:51.040> what's<00:01:51.490> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:51.880> us<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:52.180> is

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
but what's going to get us there is

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.500 
but what's going to get us there is
distorting<00:01:54.160> these<00:01:54.340> couple<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.730> pedals<00:01:55.390> in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
distorting these couple of pedals in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.470 
distorting these couple of pedals in
front<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.870> sparkle<00:01:56.170> driver<00:01:56.380> mod<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.240> let's<00:01:58.240> go

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
front of sparkle driver mod so let's go

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.270 
front of sparkle driver mod so let's go
ahead<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.780> add<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.110> echo<00:01:59.440> which<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.860> one

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
ahead and add the echo which is one

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.070 
ahead and add the echo which is one
repeat<00:02:00.610> here

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.380 

and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.050 
and
that<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.300> reverb<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:18.549> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that and actually the reverb is and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.759 
that and actually the reverb is and
after<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.480> sparkle<00:02:19.870> drive<00:02:20.049> mod<00:02:20.319> this

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
after the sparkle drive mod this

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.080 
after the sparkle drive mod this
simulates<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.519> they<00:02:21.610> would<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.909> done

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
simulates what they would have done

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.699 
simulates what they would have done
during<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.450> recording<00:02:22.870> process<00:02:22.989> which<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:23.500> to

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
during the recording process which is to

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.160 
during the recording process which is to
add<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> clean<00:02:24.310> long<00:02:25.000> plate<00:02:25.360> reverb<00:02:25.629> at<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.019> end

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
add a clean long plate reverb at the end

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:44.340 
add a clean long plate reverb at the end
so<00:02:26.489> here's<00:02:27.489> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.110 

what<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:45.100> missing<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.580> actually<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> face

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
what we're missing is actually the face

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640 
what we're missing is actually the face
90<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> pretty<00:02:47.260> much<00:02:47.350> take

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
90 and this is going to pretty much take

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:02.430 
90 and this is going to pretty much take
us<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.490> with<00:02:48.610> this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:22.190 

Oh

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.480 

once<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.260> get<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> phase<00:03:23.680> 90<00:03:23.890> dialed<00:03:24.370> in

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
once you get the phase 90 dialed in

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.520 
once you get the phase 90 dialed in
distort<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.000> front<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.510> pedal<00:03:26.020> it

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
distort it in front of the pedal it

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:44.300 
distort it in front of the pedal it
gives<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:26.950> soft<00:03:27.250> weave<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.780> doesn't

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.860 

so<00:03:45.310> that's<00:03:45.459> pretty<00:03:45.609> much<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:46.090> again<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.659> trick

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
so that's pretty much it again the trick

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.770 
so that's pretty much it again the trick
is<00:03:47.019> distorting<00:03:47.590> these<00:03:47.799> effects<00:03:48.629> needed<00:03:49.629> from

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
is distorting these effects needed from

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.059 
is distorting these effects needed from
the<00:03:49.870> amp<00:03:50.049> or<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.319> this<00:03:50.409> case<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.769> know<00:03:50.859> you<00:03:50.950> can

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
the amp or in this case you know you can

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.589 
the amp or in this case you know you can
use<00:03:51.249> lead<00:03:51.489> mod<00:03:51.670> number<00:03:51.939> three<00:03:52.090> which<00:03:52.239> has<00:03:52.420> that

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
use lead mod number three which has that

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.869 
use lead mod number three which has that
same<00:03:52.840> voicing<00:03:53.349> for<00:03:53.379> it<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.489> doing<00:03:54.700> a

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
same voicing for it and then doing a

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.089 
same voicing for it and then doing a
clean<00:03:55.209> River<00:03:55.389> post<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:58.530> okay<00:03:59.530> one<00:03:59.920> other

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
clean River post that okay one other

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.869 
clean River post that okay one other
thing<00:04:00.400> um<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:02.109> found<00:04:02.799> in<00:04:03.010> later<00:04:03.280> recording<00:04:03.790> to

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
thing um I found in later recording to

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.369 
thing um I found in later recording to
that<00:04:04.000> he<00:04:04.060> was<00:04:04.209> doing<00:04:04.450> he<00:04:04.629> actually<00:04:04.959> was<00:04:05.079> using

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
that he was doing he actually was using

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.470 
that he was doing he actually was using
a<00:04:05.469> little<00:04:05.620> bit<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:05.920> course<00:04:06.400> which<00:04:06.969> it<00:04:07.239> seemed

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
a little bit of course which it seemed

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.659 
a little bit of course which it seemed
to<00:04:07.540> be<00:04:07.599> coming<00:04:07.810> from<00:04:08.109> this<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.950> role<00:04:09.159> in<00:04:09.310> DC

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
to be coming from this this role in DC

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.199 
to be coming from this this role in DC
30<00:04:10.030> rack<00:04:10.419> thing<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.340> started<00:04:12.760> working<00:04:12.909> on

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
30 rack thing so I started working on

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.089 
30 rack thing so I started working on
that<00:04:13.419> a<00:04:13.450> little<00:04:13.780> bit<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.139> it's<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.439> same<00:04:14.739> setup

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
that a little bit so it's the same setup

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.150 
that a little bit so it's the same setup
but<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:15.790> get<00:04:15.939> rid<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.239> phase<00:04:16.419> 90<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.829> then

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
but we get rid of the phase 90 and then

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.010 
but we get rid of the phase 90 and then
we<00:04:19.979> we<00:04:20.979> move<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.370> delay<00:04:21.759> to<00:04:22.479> an<00:04:22.570> even<00:04:22.780> shorter

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
we we move this delay to an even shorter

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:33.990 
we we move this delay to an even shorter
slap<00:04:30.720> like<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.500> then<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.669> add<00:04:33.820> this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
slap like that and then we add this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.029 
slap like that and then we add this
little<00:04:34.479> analog<00:04:34.930> course<00:04:35.169> on<00:04:35.320> top<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.830> so

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
little analog course on top of this so

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.710 
little analog course on top of this so
this<00:04:38.220> actually<00:04:39.220> these<00:04:39.520> it's<00:04:40.090> for<00:04:40.330> two<00:04:40.479> little

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
this actually these it's for two little

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.420 
this actually these it's for two little
guitar<00:04:40.840> she<00:04:41.259> was<00:04:41.410> tuned<00:04:41.770> up<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.130> I'm<00:04:42.220> going<00:04:42.340> to

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
guitar she was tuned up so I'm going to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.360 
guitar she was tuned up so I'm going to
use<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> capo<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.800> give<00:04:44.800> me<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.039> same<00:04:45.280> tuning<00:04:47.370> so

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
use a capo to give me the same tuning so

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.270 
use a capo to give me the same tuning so
a<00:04:48.610> little<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.570> chorus<00:04:53.099> with<00:04:54.099> this

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
a little bit of the chorus with this

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:12.730 
a little bit of the chorus with this
little<00:04:55.229> so

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.210 

propose<00:05:13.740> do<00:05:13.889> without<00:05:14.010> it

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.310 

and<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:23.510> course<00:05:23.720> actually<00:05:23.930> sounds<00:05:24.290> good

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
and the course actually sounds good

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.430 
and the course actually sounds good
distorted<00:05:24.860> along<00:05:25.190> with<00:05:25.310> that
