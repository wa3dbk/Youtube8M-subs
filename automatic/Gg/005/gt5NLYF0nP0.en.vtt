by<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:41.460> figure<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.180> not

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
by it as well so this figure it's not

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
by it as well so this figure it's not
really<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> bobblehead<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.410> much<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> mid

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
really a bobblehead as much as a mid

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.060 
really a bobblehead as much as a mid
body<00:00:44.760> bobble<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.200> weird<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.800> head

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
body bobble it's kind of weird the head

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.670 
body bobble it's kind of weird the head
does<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.610> move<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.289> detail

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
does not actually move on it the detail

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
does not actually move on it the detail
work<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.190> quite<00:00:50.579> good<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.690> look<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
work is quite good if you look at the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.529 
work is quite good if you look at the
legs<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:53.280> did<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.730> well<00:00:53.879> very

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
legs here they did it very well very

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
legs here they did it very well very
true<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> form<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> Metroid<00:00:56.280> Prime

true to the form of the Metroid Prime
character<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.800> was<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:58.980> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
character I was actually really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
character I was actually really
impressed<00:00:59.489> when<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.170> received

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
impressed when I got this and received

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
impressed when I got this and received
in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.649> mail<00:01:01.739> beat<00:01:02.370> based<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
in the mail beat based on all of the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
in the mail beat based on all of the
detail<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.549> 4<00:01:05.790> figures

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
detail in this I think first 4 figures

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.090 
detail in this I think first 4 figures
has<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> San<00:01:06.869> miss<00:01:07.049> character<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.560> well<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.040> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
has a San miss character as well and I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
has a San miss character as well and I'm
not<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.270> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
not going to get that one because I have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.070 
not going to get that one because I have
this<00:01:09.659> already<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> she<00:01:11.400> looks<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.729> good

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
this already but she looks really good

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.179 
this already but she looks really good
even<00:01:13.080> though<00:01:13.200> she's<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> her<00:01:13.590> suit<00:01:13.860> because

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
even though she's in her suit because

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.880 
even though she's in her suit because
out<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> suit<00:01:14.850> she<00:01:15.000> looks<00:01:15.150> even<00:01:15.270> better

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
out of the suit she looks even better

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
out of the suit she looks even better
but<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> bobbling<00:01:18.420> actions<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
but the bobbling actions just kind of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
but the bobbling actions just kind of
really<00:01:19.439> funny<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:21.030> characters<00:01:21.479> roughly

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really funny and the characters roughly

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
really funny and the characters roughly
I<00:01:22.549> think<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.700> seven<00:01:24.030> inches<00:01:24.330> high<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.810> it's

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I think it's seven inches high so it's

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
I think it's seven inches high so it's
quite<00:01:25.200> large<00:01:25.939> now<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:28.189> try<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> get

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
quite large now if you can try and get

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
quite large now if you can try and get
it<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.790> box<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.840> box<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.290> harder<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it with this box the box is harder to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
it with this box the box is harder to
find<00:01:31.860> obviously<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.729> she<00:01:32.939> sits<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
find obviously but she sits in it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
find obviously but she sits in it
perfectly<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> does<00:01:34.140> come<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.320> plastic

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
perfectly and it does come with plastic

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
perfectly and it does come with plastic
in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> box<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> says<00:01:35.820> obviously<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> was

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
in the box and says obviously it was

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
in the box and says obviously it was
made<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:36.810> toy<00:01:37.470> site<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.650> box<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
made by toy site and the box is just

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
made by toy site and the box is just
kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> cool<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> collecting

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
kind of cool to have from a collecting

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
kind of cool to have from a collecting
standpoint<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> original<00:01:44.149> box<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
standpoint to have the original box that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060 
standpoint to have the original box that
actually<00:01:45.720> came<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.409> increases<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
actually came in it just increases the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.280 
actually came in it just increases the
value<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> cost<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
value a little bit the cost of this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.440 
value a little bit the cost of this
