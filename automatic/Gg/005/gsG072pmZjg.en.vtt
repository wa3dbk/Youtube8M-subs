thought I'd got rammed I'm not sure if

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680 
thought I'd got rammed I'm not sure if
you'd<00:00:17.490> call<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.730> rammed<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.359> FIFA

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
you'd call it rammed because it was FIFA

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
you'd call it rammed because it was FIFA
but<00:00:18.900> we'll<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.109> go<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.260> rammed<00:00:19.619> because

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
but we'll just go with rammed because

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
but we'll just go with rammed because
the<00:00:20.430> one<00:00:20.580> pack<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:20.939> says<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.330> found<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the one pack there says not found so I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.390 
the one pack there says not found so I
thought<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> might<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.350> glitched<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.220> or

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
thought it might like glitched out or

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.529 
thought it might like glitched out or
something<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.789> wasn't<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> pack

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
something I wasn't going to get the pack

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
something I wasn't going to get the pack
so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> wasn't<00:00:25.380> exactly<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> deal

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
so I wasn't exactly sure what the deal

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.589 
so I wasn't exactly sure what the deal
was<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.760> beside<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> redeem<00:00:27.420> both

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
