00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.619
 endodontics is to eliminate everything 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 the living tissue in this case the nerve 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.660
 that is inside the ducts 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 or within the regulations to be able 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.340
 preserve or maintain the sanitary organ 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 as long as possible in the cavity 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 oral in the current instruments exist 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 that facilitate the cleaning of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 conformation inside the conduit for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 that can later be filled with a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 material that is biocompatible with the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.489
 organism and thus preserve the greatest 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 possible time those dental organs 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.239
 these instruments what they have of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 innovative is that there are instruments 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.269
 rotary devices that oscillate or rotate in a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.739
 I only felt those instruments that 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.800
 they are currently working with them 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.660
 and us what is 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.510
 who handles these instruments and who 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.920
 I think that we currently have the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.150
 fortunate to be the first in mexico in 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.490
 be working with your instruments 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.810
 are the reciprocal instruments before 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.110
 reciprocally, they want both 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.869
 senses is clockwise clockwise 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.729
 and vice versa in the opposite direction to 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.100
 own hands too and that 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.229
 allow to conform and work and eliminate 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.509
 the greatest amount of microorganisms or 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.930
 bacteria or nerve tissues that are 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.290
 find inside the ducts 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.310
 we here in the specialty have 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.860
 the easy access to the instruments of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.260
 high technology which enables us 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.520
 much work and not just the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.740
 instruments but also to 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 materials that we implemented in terms of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 our treatments regularly 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.410
 the instruments are not free 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.010
 this students are the teachers we are 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.350
 who bought the instruments 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.479
 probably this one 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 one of the disadvantages could be 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.880
 the costs of the instruments because they do not 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.310
 they are economic materials but that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.920
 they offer us a very advantage 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 great that is this get a good 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 quality in terms of the treatment that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.080
 is doing we are scholarship students 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.060
 by conacyt that is a support that 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.390
 we receive from the federal government 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.370
 and part of it because it helps us to 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 manage our expenses on 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.050
 which facilitates us the acquisition of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.790
 certain certain material and instruments and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.440
 we use every day within the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 clinic because you can ensure 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.290
 certainty that the treatments that are 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.840
 carried out within the graduate are 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.489
 premium treatments given that 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.470
 one of the boys are 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.850
 constantly growing in both 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 regarding skills as in 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.920
 knowledge and with materials that day to 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.980
 day more coming out they are very innovative 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.680
 and the postgraduate course allows you to work with 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.739
 this kind of materials and so be able 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.010
 Give them a very good treatment 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.010
 quality
