00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
doesn't score 100 goals because if he

does<00:02:45.290> they're<00:02:45.710> pretty<00:02:45.920> screwed<00:02:46.280> unless<00:02:46.460> they

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
does they're pretty screwed unless they

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.340 
does they're pretty screwed unless they
stick<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.000> hundred<00:02:47.270> on<00:02:47.360> his<00:02:47.480> card<00:02:47.750> but

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
stick a hundred on his card but

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.050 
stick a hundred on his card but
basically<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.460> calendar<00:02:49.730> year<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
basically it is in this calendar year I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.580 
basically it is in this calendar year I
think<00:02:50.360> he's<00:02:50.450> only<00:02:50.570> got<00:02:50.750> one<00:02:50.780> or<00:02:51.050> two<00:02:51.230> games

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
think he's only got one or two games

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.490 
think he's only got one or two games
left<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.790> increasingly<00:02:53.360> unlikely<00:02:53.900> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
left so it is increasingly unlikely that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.160 
left so it is increasingly unlikely that
he<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.710> gonna<00:02:54.890> score<00:02:55.190> 100<00:02:55.610> goals<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:56.570> he<00:02:57.020> might

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
he is gonna score 100 goals but he might

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.300 
he is gonna score 100 goals but he might
get<00:02:57.350> another<00:02:57.470> two<00:02:57.740> or<00:02:57.770> three<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.190> know

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
get another two or three you know

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.740 
get another two or three you know

be<00:03:23.180> honest<00:03:23.420> guys<00:03:23.600> players<00:03:24.410> passing<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:24.920> around

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
be honest guys players passing it around

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.400 
be honest guys players passing it around
eventually<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.820> will<00:03:25.910> come<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.240> Massey<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.720> he

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
eventually it will come to Massey and he

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.870 
eventually it will come to Massey and he
scores<00:03:27.710> a<00:03:27.830> pretty<00:03:28.040> nice<00:03:28.220> goal<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.610> gives<00:03:28.790> you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
ace just back off straight in there and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.280 
ace just back off straight in there and
he<00:04:03.380> can<00:04:03.590> do<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.310> consistently<00:04:05.000> he<00:04:05.720> scored

he can do that in consistently he scored
one<00:04:06.500> or<00:04:06.620> two<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:06.920> those<00:04:07.010> for<00:04:07.310> me<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.730> I

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
one or two of those for me and I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.750 
one or two of those for me and I
probably<00:04:09.110> stride<00:04:09.530> another<00:04:09.890> ten<00:04:10.130> times<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.670> do

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
probably stride another ten times to do

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.520 
probably stride another ten times to do
a<00:04:10.790> similar<00:04:11.030> shot<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:12.110> went<00:04:12.260> into<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
a similar shot and it went into the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.430 
a similar shot and it went into the
stands<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.480> seems<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.810> be<00:04:14.900> has<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.290> be

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
stands so it seems to be has to be

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.900 
stands so it seems to be has to be
perfectly<00:04:15.950> positioned<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.489> pull<00:04:16.670> off<00:04:16.760> those

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
perfectly positioned to pull off those

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.520 
perfectly positioned to pull off those
kind<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.180> things<00:04:17.330> that<00:04:17.840> gives<00:04:18.020> you<00:04:18.140> an<00:04:18.200> idea<00:04:18.290> of

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
kind of things that gives you an idea of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.780 
kind of things that gives you an idea of
his<00:04:18.739> dribbling<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.280> little<00:04:19.460> bit<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.640> dribbling

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
his dribbling a little bit of dribbling

his dribbling a little bit of dribbling
in<00:04:20.060> there<00:04:20.210> you<00:04:20.510> don't<00:04:20.690> need<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.870> use<00:04:21.109> any<00:04:21.290> of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
in there you don't need to use any of

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.930 
in there you don't need to use any of
the<00:04:21.680> heads-up<00:04:22.040> dribbling<00:04:22.520> or<00:04:22.640> anything<00:04:22.910> like

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
the heads-up dribbling or anything like

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.970 
the heads-up dribbling or anything like
that<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.240> just<00:04:23.450> need<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.020> use<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.230> left<00:04:24.650> stick

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
that you just need to use the left stick

that you just need to use the left stick
he<00:04:25.610> will<00:04:25.790> do<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.090> rest<00:04:26.240> for<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.600> he<00:04:26.870> will

past players big issues he is very weak

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.310 
past players big issues he is very weak
he<00:04:30.830> honestly<00:04:31.730> he<00:04:31.970> gets<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.390> know<00:04:32.480> he<00:04:32.600> manages

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
he honestly he gets I know he manages

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.930 
he honestly he gets I know he manages
sometimes<00:04:33.710> together<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.160> ball<00:04:34.340> back<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:34.850> he

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
sometimes together the ball back but he

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.510 
sometimes together the ball back but he
gets<00:04:35.210> shrugged<00:04:35.570> off<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> ball<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.500> much<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:37.400> he

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
gets shrugged off the ball so much so he

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.670 
gets shrugged off the ball so much so he
was<00:04:37.670> weak<00:04:37.940> from<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.510> standpoint<00:04:38.840> in

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
was weak from that standpoint in

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.700 
was weak from that standpoint in
addition<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.520> he's<00:04:41.360> not<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.800> fast<00:04:43.250> and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
addition to that he's not that fast and

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.320 
addition to that he's not that fast and
his<00:04:45.710> card<00:04:46.010> face<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.370> think<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.610> says<00:04:46.730> 893

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
his card face I think it says 893

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.080 
his card face I think it says 893
someone<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.590> pace<00:04:48.830> whether<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:49.910> his

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
someone on the pace whether that is his

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
feel anywhere near as fast as he should
