00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello 'ray guys think I am to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.179
 you, but the time was commented and the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 Today's video is again on cauby 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 goals and it's another video about my 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 Look at the series of gun guides should only be 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 remember that the last episode you brought was 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
 just a form of dlc america 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 at first it should be and today we are going 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 talking back about a gun should be 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 that the ripper that came now in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 second must be from the lc code 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.200
 onslaught a game devastation not high 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 was the first and this area is already 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 available in xbox 360 xbox or not right 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.290
 time gives a little more than a month there not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.329
 I think well over a month at the time she 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.469
 was released personal of the feet course 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.289
 Anyway, I know it has arrived recently. 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 the ps3 pec 4 pc also you guys that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.870
 It's 161 feet 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 if you do not need a piece you will be able to have it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.280
 her when she goes out to the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 also the platforms that you 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.789
 made 34 and pc 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.620
 but enough of that we'll go to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.820
 weapon statistics 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 I'm sorry for my voice, take one 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 A wee bit is that I'm kind of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.070
 cold 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.020
 it's over let's drp a gun 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 automatic screen does not cost anything to be 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.110
 released since it is a certain dlc weapon 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.970
 its owner varies 34-24 ie 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 who kills with three shots from close range and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.380
 five from a distance and not the owner of it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 change if she has in assault fsm gildo 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.119
 not the same for both versions is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.150
 however the kiss of reach so gun 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 changes the scope to the smg version varies 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.420
 from 9 thousand and six meters to 19,3 meters 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 it means that up to 9.6 meters it gives 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.189
 always 34 damage between 9.6 and 19.3 of the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.200
 year is at 34 and 24 and from 19.3 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.170
 year is always 24 ok 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 already in the rage assault version or the owner 34 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.640
 lasts up to 24.2 meters and the damage 24 starts 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.829
 only 48.4 meters, ie the increase 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 income between mg versions there is only one 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.509
 asset is very considerable 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.759
 her comb was 32 bullets going up 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.770
 for 48 you used these non- prescription drugs 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.539
 has change from one version to the other 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.140
 semi software has always been to have two 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.790
 bullets 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 the time of revealed of her also to the same 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 program and versions 3.1 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.970
 seconds with bullets on the comb and 3.33 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.890
 seconds without any bullets 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.430
 the dean of a symbol for a version for 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 another 968 rounds per minute of Rafael 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.250
 version s mg and 674 bullets per minute is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.010
 take advantage of version assault rage 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.770
 and resorted from the rip is considered low 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.170
 right then these are the statistics of the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.970
 the ripper the new weapon of the code and how 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.580
 you could see there is a difference between 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.100
 one version and another only in the range and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.380
 rector fire and there in each of the versions 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.990
 one in each of these 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.850
 statistics a version takes advantage 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.110
 good then we'll talk some more now 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.180
 gun background 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.830
 I particularly liked the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.360
 sella very good weapon much better than the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.660
 fog that even came in the first 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.340
 must be right and she has some 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.900
 interesting characteristics precisely 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.970
 for being the first area of ​​the history of 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.640
 fully hybrid code is because the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.870
 people already had guns that are hybrids 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.850
 between quotation marks but they are not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.140
 completely lives like the one that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.450
 at any time for a form 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.100
 completely 100 percent of that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.340
 so you're exchanging understood type 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.810
 You have a 100% smgl mg and there in the middle 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.270
 of the match you exchange for an assault 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.010
 rafael 100% assault in the iapi neighborhood 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.750
 skipper of the black ops 2 is the era one 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.610
 hybrid of grap assault mg but it was 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.280
 everything next to her was already mixed 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.010
 there you had characteristics in a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.110
 same gun from Australia, this is not 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.220
 only you have surgery but the traffic to 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.740
 any moment is not then the owner of it 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.360
 walking is considerable damage that 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.250
 is there in the middle know is not a damage 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.170
 super strong but also not weak three 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.000
 children from close range and five shots from afar is 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.860
 an acceptable damage you kill with three 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.470
 close shots with the mg messi 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.970
 It's cool with the iphone's assault. 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.580
 compulsory and you kill with five shots 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.050
 by far as mg is the standard also 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.720
 the higher the refuge is a bit bad 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.700
 usually is the good copyright killed with 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.440
 four shots from a distance is lighter to 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.240
 people have to balance and to do without 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.330
 balance it all then plausible 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.410
 until 35, it's for me. 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.940
 well balanced 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.980
 the range it also somewhat 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.900
 interesting as you have seen the range of 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.140
 assault in the neighborhood is much higher this 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.380
 It is also nice so is by example 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.940
 maximum rate of the smga version 19.3 meters 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.270
 the minimum system version 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.060
 goes to 24.2 meters so it's one thing 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.590
 absurd you can do the maximum damage 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.320
 water in iphone software version 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.300
 while in the same version cited in the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.170
 least at the same distance we are 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.570
 even greater 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.550
 So, you have a great advantage. 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.050
 to see only asset in this sense it 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.750
 really works at a higher risk 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.710
 in his rage assault rafael already 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.390
 you can see that you also have a 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.630
 discrepancy is quite large 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.990
 s version 968 mg loose rounds per minute 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.430
 while the softwell 674 bullets per minute 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.340
 these numbers are also well numbers 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.500
 968 patterns for ufmg is a good number 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.900
 number 1 until a little above the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.550
 and 674 for a neighborhood assault. 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.620
 It's also a good number there in the 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.180
 standards a bad thing about this weapon 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.190
 precisely its time to reload the time 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.770
 clock 3.1 seconds with clay in 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.680
 comb and 3.33 with no bullet is a time 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.110
 effectively so it is almost 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.760
 essential you are using a 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.310
 end user in this weapon 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.690
 ok and other cool features of it 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.700
 is the following record of it is quite 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.440
 similar to beige rone may have 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.820
 perceived if you played with it you will 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.980
 to see that its market is low but it is a 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.320
 completely crazy variable error it 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.210
 it's not the standard that always goes up 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.710
 Always one side him he will prove 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.060
 the sides at once only every time 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.220
 You take a different roney thing. 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.470
 bédié this is two other 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.030
 interesting characteristics of it is that 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.190
 regardless of the version that it is the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.890
 mg mg the assault aifu the speed of 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.900
 her move is always too mg and 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.480
 aiming speed is also always more mg 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.490
 whether you are in the mg or 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.320
 new versions other found your character 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.150
 he will always be running as if 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.460
 was holding more mg 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.800
 nor the movements of other 90s is always 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.580
 100% on the movement speed of more 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.580
 high risk generally 95% smg 100% and 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.919
 mp is simple 100% and ads speed 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.450
 also is always ms mg that is 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.100
 a great advantage for when 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.720
 Are you using the assault version? 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.370
 anger you must have realized that 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.950
 The more it attracted, the slower the first. 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.330
 than the highest mg then at high 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.750
 example it is much more common to see 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.880
 people using athletic jewelry looks 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.979
 quick fast balcony do not know how it is 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.419
 It is coming to the mercy en but at last the 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.680
 street is always the speed of 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.870
 emergency a very large advantage 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.529
 for when you are using assault 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.029
 on the neighborhood 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.069
 It's another peculiarity that I think 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.509
 you should not know is that her forte 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.019
 changes according to the version you 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:51.239
 is using in mg the focus of it 55 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:53.939
 and at that time it was 50 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:56.959
 So there's this difference and the son 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:59.429
 saw no console pattern occurs and 60 né 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.589
 6065 I do not remember my head here now but 

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:03.179
 there is a difference for every one that 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.279
 You're using this, we do not 

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:08.099
 perceives but rather each has a focus 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.869
 different is in the console on the pc people 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.549
 change focus and leave default 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:13.019
 but anyway this is it 

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:15.119
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.919
 brief review here and would recommend 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:18.989
 even for you it would recommend you 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:23.159
 is using hypercom exchange 

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:27.209
 nymex and perhaps the attmani of increasing 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:29.159
 reach the museum break this Sunday 

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.869
 in the game either game I do not remember 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.759
 Head technos think the museum break 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:35.339
 in the group I find it unnecessary to 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:36.839
 suppressor is still possible but I think 

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:38.669
 promised yourself you close much 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:40.679
 gun anyway but it goes of your choice I 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:41.669
 I would recommend these two beauty still 

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:43.559
 before you finish 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.239
 It's just let you know that you left. 

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:46.619

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.999

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:49.860

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:51.659

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.489
