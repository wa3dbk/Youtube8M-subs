00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.860
 manufacturer is known for being 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.610
 cheap but still pretty good 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.679
 tablets 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 the a1 series is an example of on the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.439
 legs and the a3 series becomes the a 1 series 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.660
 is a series with android tablets with 18 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.519
 screens about an update here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 so got on the ces announced then 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.000
 there sang done of him i must be we 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 inside and I'll see you in this previewer 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.310
 tell something more about going to the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.509
 A1 830 138 and this falls under his 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.670
 design 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.440
 to start from the beginning the h1 830 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.340
 the soon available but goes 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.400
 as expected 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.170
 costs between 150 and 200 euros and 7.9 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.440
 inch screen with an xga resolution that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.080
 ie from 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
 he also has a metal construction 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.280
 actually quite a lot on the ipad mini 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.850
 but that is certainly not a disadvantage and peace 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 has a dual-core intel in eps display 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 processor, of course, also know a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.530
 camera on the back 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.360
 in terms of design as said in best 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 a lot like the ipad mini and me 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.570
 actually very much like the ipad mini 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.260
 we would almost like to have water on them 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 say 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 aluminum back you top one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 nice plastic strip 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 otherwise just pretty tight same 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 format fits nicely in your hand 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
 yes it is not very original but certainly 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.800
 an advantage 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 there is often in this price category 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 just a little less design and that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.790
 applies to this week in 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.920
 iconia a1 830 certainly not to the tablet 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 is also reasonably good in terms of format 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.430
 weight also pretty good 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.260
 so in that sense in terms of design we are the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.490
 very satisfied with it and he is 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.830
 typical case 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.720
 better swiped well than badly conceived 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.540
 did this very well 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 my screen, on the other hand, is not that whole 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 good 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.930
 certainly not comparable to the ipad 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 mini it is of course also a lot 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.940
 cheaper tablets with 7.9 inch screen 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.200
 an xga resolution saying 1024 at 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.120
 768 pixels 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 it is an eps the display but that is 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.890
 really not to give up 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 look how we are already reasonable but not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.950
 were very well be black 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 cool the same for it is quite one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.220
 little bit gray all really up to date 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.180
 make the display a little deeper below 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.770
 the body light and 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.440
 that just detracts a bit from the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.840
 quality of the display 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.520
 such a shame but it is one 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.260
 cheap tablet so are certainly tablets 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.540
 in this segment that somewhat better screen 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.460
 but it is not very far below 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.130
 the average or so sure to live with 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.630
 the processor is a part core processor 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.730
 intel processor and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.220
 respect he say that still pretty good 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.320
 its it is an intel atom processor 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 a gigahertz process that would in itself 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.200
 have to work well it does on it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.820
 face not quite have yet 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 wait a moment, of course, for us 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.640
 completely we can come but me 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.900
 actually find that he is sometimes bishop 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.430
 slow responds I have for example 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.560
 number of times the browser was tried 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.230
 start by chance, but often 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.820
 it is quite difficult and it takes 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.350
 just before he completely 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.190
 has and that actually goes 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.750
 to carry out 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.550
 so dune could have been a little faster 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.020
 but yes let there come in our 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.820
 fully review on back or that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.300
 in our final verdict 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.220
 always is 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.540
 but for now i have a someone one 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.790
 bit the idea that the tablet what to the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.560
 slow side is the camera of these tablets 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.300
 in 5 megapixel camera that is not very 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.130
 very exciting it is about standard 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.930
 in the tablet segment the moment 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.400
 we still need the photos that come out 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.350
 full view but probably 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.459
 what we are doing now have seen them 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.250
 not very exciting 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.720
 just to do but good to stay 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.799
 a tablet are of course also not the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.160
 best devices for photographing 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.160
 and in that sense maybe it is just normal 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.810
 acceptable further in terms of functions 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.100
 so a fairly standard tablet on 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.239
 fine 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.890
 it is also just a micro sd card 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.660
 Finally, in so nice sitting in the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.260
 side is not really well finished 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.290
 him well 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.700
 that is a small point of course and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.680
 furthermore it is just tablet that you 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.209
 really to buy his design is like 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560
 an ipad mini might not be in most 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.239
 original design but just one 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.890
 nice aluminum body and that is something 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.329
 certainly not used to this price 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.390
 So that's a big advantage of this 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.560
 acer iconia a1 and beyond is just one 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.450
 fairly standard tablet 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.100
 price that in itself is not bad on it 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.840
 at first sight and as a complete one 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.730
 Judgments will of course be later in our 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.459
 full review but for now 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.170
 just looks like good tablet is whole 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.320
 nice design where you should especially 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.320
 to buy
