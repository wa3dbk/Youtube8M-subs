00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.780
 everything about the third generation sint jansteen 5 french car brands back in the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.970
 elevator open or is the bmw z4 bullied away against the bmwt city can tour 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.989
 hello and nice that you again watch the car week journal if you are now a french 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.539
 atmospheres may say because we will mainly talk about the new citroÃ«n c5 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.550
 and the giel that would be high time thinking 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.680
 he has been running since 2008 about second generation second generation c5 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.370
 he does not really do well in europe that sell that are really not the best 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 first generation went pretty well 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.950
 but the hague yes since 2008 when she went a little on the the german tour it 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 clean lines game very good looked good can always be very nice car 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 only year he does not sell well 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.550
 yes they still want a new c5 and that is not really because of it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.790
 the european make mainly because of china yes there they want ordinary people then 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.870
 for porto amsterdam it will be a network diana that will be here for a while 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.990
 have to show i looked i suspect they are sheet piling china 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.600
 they want to dance like that and of course they are not going to build a genk thing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.729
 Europe and then bringing Cia says nature the Chinese market 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.609
 in mind, and they are already putting it on the European market 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.909
 but not for the numbers of land that sees in china now without 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.260
 undercarriage technique so if in the past too many balls go than see 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.470
 no, that is now virtually extinct on the current generation 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.950
 just grab an existing platform that in w2 platform there is the modular platform 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.399
 from petra 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.999
 yes there is your new carriage on normal gasoline and diesel engines no hybrids 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.030
 on other complicated technology 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.610
 and yes that way they try to keep it simple for europe but especially that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.250
 realize growth in china as it is well understood the new c5 will be there 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.360
 just more straightforward very good in addition they of course have another 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 the s5 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 there will be a separate brand so yes yes yes for ford in front of the front door 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.770
 craziness beat term would say you can go wds and yes the design will 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.890
 both sit at cito and themselves 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.410
 but the technique is a selective one simply a minister in the newest 5 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.680
 the Dutch showrooms 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.720
 that is going to take a while, I think it will look like 2007 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.090
 good but you want to know everything about the car then you just have to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.130
 what to read now with 32 yes it should appear everything is included 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.569
 yes and we will remain in france for a while and gilbert will also be standing for a while 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.680
 Because a guild year's figures from a P standard would be encouraging to the previous one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 week can operate outside it goes a lot better from the french workers claim 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.879
 at the dope yes why 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.859
 odell a clear answer is not there it is of course a combination 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.469
 of factors but yes what you see 2009 2010 the real crisis then it went down 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.219
 downhill with psn though 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.569
 10 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.929
 and there is now again since last year you are sitting the climber in March 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.169
 that decrease was mainly because of what you needed on the one hand for budget brands 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.799
 they also performed well and high-quality brands work the clinic 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.199
 and tendons actually fell between two stools 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.219
 that is now a bit behind bruno has some new models 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.079
 The show lasts new models year especially the crossover year 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.309
 And that is where it looks at only a little bit missing 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.980
 to have 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.070
 no cross overs and they have a model range which is also pretty good 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.860
 age is starting to look look at the c5 yes but we just got over it but it also applies 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.900
 for the c3 fc 4 kpn so draws a better chance of rain yes we have a good year 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.110
 This market share is higher than Cito's other invites it open well 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.760
 ps hair is naturally present in china there is also growing and then ozzy 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.389
 again not 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.539
 So yes it is a combination of factors that you just get on the whole 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.559
 sees the range of models is back in order, further confidence is back and the 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.709
 sales figures that just show growth again 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.370
 after positive numbers and the coming 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.060
 but we are still going to see a lot of a new talisman the c5 was again about what 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.449
 the rest is all very nice thanks to the movie 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.969
 I can still remember that one of them is also against a BMW 9 91 and that 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.640
 the surface area in 2009 was a bmw m3 on 20 June 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.270
 and takes to intervene time sometimes also but after on ox 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.250
 compares with bmw yes you didn't actually do that but in 2015 there is 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.850
 The two seat office has very good reason for leg and that 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.459
 is of course an ideal competitor 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.159
 the opels a phyra 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.529
 we have a seven seater two eighteenth century is a fairly modest 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:13.680
 diesel engine and that takes on opels the fyra a tweezers city with 136 hp 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.150
 ingredients are the same 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.509
 very large carriages on a compact platform wonderfully efficient diesel engine 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.690
 but can b and w live up to its higher price compared to the open eyes 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.729
 yes and how that works out we find out in the test that holds the number 32 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.970
 and further that number extended first driving test of the Volkswagen passat no TV 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 and the bwx and the king of pop still on the road with the renewed fiat 500 and we take 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.330
 goodbye to the skoda octavia rs you come near ester 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.620
 and then we also have a double telepresence test from 2000 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.849
 Zoe Baron leaders who and Honda accord 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.029
 that was of course twitter a new episode of next week 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.819
 it all when I nick them well people a very nice week
