 assmann said 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.670
 I was so scared that he had to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.670
 obey 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.100
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.580
 I bring a trick here Map 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 that is a zombie and good of this trick 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.360
 would be in the area of â€‹â€‹what we say the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.400
 parking would be a good garage 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.140
 there was a trick here before I agreed that 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.170
 was lying there on the floor but 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.480
 well it did not work anymore I'm going to teach 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.220
 a let's say after patch that would be after 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.590
 of the patch would be just place 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.180
 here in front of this line so standing or 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.760
 Crouched or taken as you want 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 well I recommend putting it on its feet like that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 knows the distance between wall and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.790
 good and this when once you have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.650
 taking the reference or you can knock down if 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.610
 you want non-stop 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.140
 and nations and the truth is that you can 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.020
 come zombies so it's out there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.730
 up through the window also though not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 there will be they can come anyway 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.210
 it's the bad part of this trick but good 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.980
 some of this trick is that you have left 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.740
 there hooked as you see this this 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.299
 zombie has come from above 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.730
 and as you can see another one is coming over there 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 also that is going to come up here 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.770
 Well the truth is that as I said 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 it's not so bad just come up and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.380
 through the window with a companion 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.850
 watching how well it would be fine or with 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.190
 that you put a pair of klaymore since 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.540
 there are very few and nothing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.220
 this is the trick itself and I hope that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 you have enjoyed des like and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.170
 subscribe for more tedious until soon 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 maximum position 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.830
 yes
