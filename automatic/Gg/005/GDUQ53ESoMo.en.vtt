00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
on legendary they get through this it

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.259 
on legendary they get through this it
was<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.560> was<00:03:24.590> pretty<00:03:24.680> bad<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.969> say<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
was pretty it was pretty bad to say the

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.069 
was pretty it was pretty bad to say the
least

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
least

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.379 
least
it<00:03:27.379> took<00:03:27.530> me<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> long<00:03:27.980> time<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.639> get<00:03:28.849> this<00:03:29.090> this

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
it took me a long time to get this this

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.759 
it took me a long time to get this this
area<00:03:29.840> right<00:03:29.989> here<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.260> probably<00:03:30.409> the<00:03:30.650> most

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
area right here is probably the most

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.610 
area right here is probably the most
difficult<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.519> entire<00:03:31.849> level<00:03:32.530> next<00:03:33.530> to

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
difficult of the entire level next to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.110 
difficult of the entire level next to
the<00:03:33.769> hunters<00:03:34.189> hunters<00:03:34.519> were<00:03:34.700> pretty<00:03:34.909> annoying

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the hunters hunters were pretty annoying

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.209 
the hunters hunters were pretty annoying
but<00:03:35.299> that<00:03:35.419> you<00:03:35.480> did<00:03:35.629> have<00:03:35.750> rockets<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:37.040> this

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
but that you did have rockets in this

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.199 
but that you did have rockets in this
case<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.489> probably<00:03:37.760> would<00:03:37.939> have<00:03:38.030> already

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
case you probably would have already

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.390 
case you probably would have already
spent<00:03:38.599> those<00:03:38.780> Rockets<00:03:39.199> on<00:03:39.379> the<00:03:39.530> hunters<00:03:40.069> which

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
spent those Rockets on the hunters which

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.059 
spent those Rockets on the hunters which
means<00:03:40.719> than<00:03:41.719> this<00:03:42.109> in<00:03:42.379> this<00:03:42.590> moment<00:03:42.859> you

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
means than this in this moment you

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.259 
means than this in this moment you
probably<00:03:43.430> would<00:03:43.639> just<00:03:43.669> have<00:03:43.939> your<00:03:44.030> sniper

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
probably would just have your sniper

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.539 
probably would just have your sniper
rifle<00:03:44.599> with<00:03:44.689> a<00:03:44.719> few<00:03:44.959> bullets<00:03:45.260> left<00:03:45.469> if<00:03:46.430> you

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
rifle with a few bullets left if you

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.369 
rifle with a few bullets left if you
were<00:03:46.609> conserving<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:47.659> and<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.870> also<00:03:48.079> have

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.129 
your DMR so what a lot of people should
do<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.590> probably<00:03:52.280> go<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.669> the<00:03:52.730> plasma<00:03:53.139> pistol

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139
