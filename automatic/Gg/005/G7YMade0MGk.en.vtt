I have a piece of foam the pure gin and
then<00:02:15.440> some<00:02:15.800> secant<00:02:16.280> ma<00:02:16.600> matrix<00:02:17.830> as<00:02:18.830> bio<00:02:19.730> bio

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
then some secant ma matrix as bio bio

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.630 
then some secant ma matrix as bio bio
media<00:02:20.810> which<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.470> stuff<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.860> great<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
media which that stuff is great to it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.390 
media which that stuff is great to it
it's<00:02:22.880> bigger<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.380> allows<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.130> much

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it's bigger so it allows for like a much

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.540 
it's bigger so it allows for like a much
better<00:02:25.640> water<00:02:25.970> flow<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:27.410> believe<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.190> opinion

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
better water flow I I believe my opinion

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.890 
better water flow I I believe my opinion
oh<00:02:30.070> yeah<00:02:31.070> that's<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.580> man<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.820> also<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.630> don't

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
oh yeah that's it man and also I don't

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.370 
oh yeah that's it man and also I don't
know

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.710 
know
well<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.430> Amano<00:02:34.790> shrimp<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.360> actually

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
well this Amano shrimp is actually

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.050 
well this Amano shrimp is actually
buried<00:02:35.960> it's<00:02:36.590> kind<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.010> crazy<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.820> him<00:02:37.940> in

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
buried it's kind of crazy I put him in

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.940 
buried it's kind of crazy I put him in
here<00:02:38.300> with<00:02:38.330> another<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:39.260> mono<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.890> I

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
here with another little mono and I

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.430 
here with another little mono and I
guess<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.400> male<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> female<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.440> she's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
guess it's a male and a female and she's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.070 
guess it's a male and a female and she's
buried<00:02:42.800> now<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.370> too<00:02:44.330> bad<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.630> babies<00:02:44.930> won't

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
buried now but too bad the babies won't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.170 
buried now but too bad the babies won't
survive<00:02:45.410> because<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.790> raise<00:02:46.970> them

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
survive because you have to raise them

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.460 
survive because you have to raise them
in<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.650> brackish<00:02:48.650> brackish<00:02:49.310> environment<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:51.350> I
