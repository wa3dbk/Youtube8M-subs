00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
to run and put that the system then we

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.679 
to run and put that the system then we
can<00:01:03.439> pick<00:01:03.650> up<00:01:03.799> we<00:01:04.549> have<00:01:04.909> three<00:01:05.390> main

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
can pick up we have three main

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.719 
can pick up we have three main
components<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.770> problem<00:01:07.070> one<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
components in this problem one is the

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.690 
components in this problem one is the
academic<00:01:07.880> component<00:01:08.869> day<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.920> lectures<00:01:10.400> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
academic component day the lectures and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.849 
academic component day the lectures and
the<00:01:10.789> workshops<00:01:11.299> there<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.780> also<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
the workshops there is also the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.069 
the workshops there is also the
component<00:01:13.429> about<00:01:13.729> learning<00:01:14.509> about<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
component about learning about the

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.160 
component about learning about the
school<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:15.710> we<00:01:15.859> have<00:01:16.039> school<00:01:16.340> visits<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.210> then

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
school so we have school visits and then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.529 
school so we have school visits and then
there<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.679> cultural<00:01:19.429> component<00:01:20.240> learning

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
there is a cultural component learning

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.279 
there is a cultural component learning
about<00:01:20.810> us<00:01:21.320> culture<00:01:22.149> that's<00:01:23.149> cool<00:01:26.020> she<00:01:27.020> wants

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
about us culture that's cool she wants

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.010 
about us culture that's cool she wants
to<00:01:27.409> see<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.829> malaysian<00:01:28.219> derby<00:01:28.609> today<00:01:29.020> since

to see the malaysian derby today since

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.130 
to see the malaysian derby today since
she<00:01:30.320> saw<00:01:31.219> some<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.999> scenes<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:32.719> a<00:01:32.810> movie

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
she saw some of the scenes in a movie

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.139 
she saw some of the scenes in a movie
like<00:01:33.350> american<00:01:33.829> movie<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.520> like

destroying you know something especially
when<00:01:37.939> she's<00:01:38.689> curious<00:01:39.049> about<00:01:39.439> a<00:01:39.679> both<00:01:40.369> most

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
when she's curious about a both most

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.690 
when she's curious about a both most
school<00:01:41.179> districts<00:01:41.719> have<00:01:41.929> longer<00:01:42.590> than<00:01:42.859> our<00:01:42.890> 8

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
school districts have longer than our 8

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.340 
school districts have longer than our 8
to<00:01:43.939> 2<00:01:44.090> 30<00:01:45.039> from<00:01:46.039> what<00:01:46.549> they<00:01:46.759> share<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.600> looks

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
to 2 30 from what they share it looks

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.830 
to 2 30 from what they share it looks
like<00:01:48.619> most<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.219> their<00:01:49.399> instruction<00:01:49.999> is<00:01:50.149> what

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
like most of their instruction is what

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.230 
like most of their instruction is what
we<00:01:50.960> call<00:01:51.229> direct<00:01:51.799> instruction<00:01:52.729> with<00:01:52.939> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
we call direct instruction with the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.020 
we call direct instruction with the
teacher<00:01:53.509> at<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.560> center<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.899> they<00:01:56.899> don't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
teacher at the center and they don't

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.510 
teacher at the center and they don't
think<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.590> problem<00:02:01.069> because

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
think that that is a problem because

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090 
think that that is a problem because
their<00:02:02.450> students<00:02:02.899> are<00:02:03.079> getting<00:02:03.259> good<00:02:03.649> scores

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
their students are getting good scores

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.969 
their students are getting good scores
in<00:02:04.490> international<00:02:05.270> comparisons<00:02:06.139> so<00:02:06.829> they

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
in international comparisons so they

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.460 
in international comparisons so they
don't<00:02:07.159> feel<00:02:07.399> compelled<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.539> make<00:02:08.690> big<00:02:09.440> changes

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
don't feel compelled to make big changes

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.510 
don't feel compelled to make big changes
in<00:02:10.250> their<00:02:10.940> practices<00:02:11.770> because<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:13.459> think

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
in their practices because they think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520 
in their practices because they think
that<00:02:13.910> because<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.810> scores<00:02:15.260> their

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
that because of the scores their

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.160 
that because of the scores their
students<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:16.100> they<00:02:16.340> are<00:02:16.430> doing<00:02:16.730> well<00:02:16.970> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
students get they are doing well but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.040 
students get they are doing well but
same<00:02:18.319> time<00:02:18.650> they<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.700> are<00:02:19.730> open<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.480> try<00:02:20.990> to

environment to focus more on

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.780 
environment to focus more on
mathematical<00:03:08.060> teaching<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:10.130> tried<00:03:10.459> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
mathematical teaching we have tried to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.440 
mathematical teaching we have tried to
provide<00:03:11.590> Korean<00:03:12.590> features<00:03:13.100> with

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
provide Korean features with

opportunities to learn firsthand from

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.530 
opportunities to learn firsthand from
some<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.060> best<00:03:21.340> approaches<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:22.940> are

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
some of the best approaches that we are

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.340 
some of the best approaches that we are
aware<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.620> our<00:03:24.859> sessions<00:03:25.459> combine

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
aware of so our sessions combine

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.330 
aware of so our sessions combine
lectures<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:28.239> presentations<00:03:29.239> with

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
lectures and presentations with

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.650 
lectures and presentations with
workshops<00:03:31.340> where<00:03:31.730> they<00:03:31.910> will<00:03:32.060> be<00:03:32.120> engaged

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
workshops where they will be engaged

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.490 
workshops where they will be engaged
with<00:03:32.930> curriculum<00:03:33.890> with<00:03:34.670> activities<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:36.200> the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
with curriculum with activities in the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.580 
with curriculum with activities in the
way<00:03:36.650> we<00:03:36.890> think<00:03:37.480> students<00:03:38.480> should<00:03:38.510> be<00:03:38.840> engaged

way we think students should be engaged
so<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.579> they<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.359> learn<00:03:41.540> mathematics<00:03:42.440> best
