00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:06.409
Second point of how the elbow should be used

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:07.728
now the second point

00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:13.214
when elbow is back

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:16.797
between the forearm, the second part of the arm

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:21.266
should, must get close to each other

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:21.914
like this

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:23.881
why?

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.547
because its close to each other

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:27.449
its banded

00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:30.547
because its banded together

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:35.065
it can be stretched, it can be opened

00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:35.732
so watch this

00:00:36.517 --> 00:00:37.831
tight here

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:43.147
because its tight I can open it

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:48.497
I can generate more power from there to like this

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.497
like boxer

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:56.298
2 arms close each other so power can come out

00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:57.831
from here to there

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:00.933
like this, like that

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:06.150
but because if their, boxers arm is wider like that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.018
there is no power can be made

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.268
and slow

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:11.383
it should be tighter

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:11.916
same

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.100
in my experience

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.018
5-6 out of 10 players, club players

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:23.735
some juniors, they don't make this tight

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.234
they already open it

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.916
now because elbow is already opened

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:33.000
they cannot generate any more power

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.817
because it is already opened

00:01:34.817 --> 00:01:36.216
watch this

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:37.884
tight I can stretch

00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:41.483
I open it

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.133
I have to do like this

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.602
because they open it they hit it there

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:53.116
if I make tighter, I can stretch my arm in front

00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:56.518
of my body which is right

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:59.416
so many players hit above their head

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:02.317
because they already open it

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:03.320
and hit like that

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.902
watch this

00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:08.778
please focus on my elbow

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:10.443
ok this is right way

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:11.043
ok have a look

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:13.093
tight

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.043
because it is tight

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:27.410
I can stretch there, there

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.178
now wrong way

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.028
because it is already opened

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:38.627
I can't go in front

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:41.511
I have to hit like this

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:42.527
so much difference

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.561
if racket is inside my body

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:49.528
elbow tight

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:51.861
you have all the power, look

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:54.277
there

00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:03.728
now, you can't do this way hit if you have this one

00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:09.978
compare

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.935
right

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:17.585
tight

00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:20.818
tight

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:24.604
open

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:37.574
so, do not ready like this

00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:43.403
make your posture inside, small compact

00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:48.787
because it is compact you can use it in explosive way

00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:49.537
like this

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.086
tight and then

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:55.800
tight and then bang stretch

00:03:56.952 --> 00:04:00.402
already stretched nothing to stretch

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:03.002
here

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:04.320
tight

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:08.168
not like this
