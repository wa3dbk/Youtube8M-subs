that was released but to the public by
Acura<00:00:22.939> ok<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> start<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.869> gonna<00:00:24.990> have

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
Acura ok so to start off it's gonna have

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.640 
Acura ok so to start off it's gonna have
a<00:00:25.260> VTEC<00:00:25.920> v6<00:00:26.220> engine<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:28.199> probably<00:00:28.560> gonna

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a VTEC v6 engine and it's probably gonna

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
a VTEC v6 engine and it's probably gonna
generate<00:00:29.160> about<00:00:29.340> 300<00:00:30.240> horsepower<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.940> it's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
generate about 300 horsepower or so it's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.770 
generate about 300 horsepower or so it's
gonna<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> sh<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:34.260> wheel<00:00:34.500> drive<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
gonna be a sh all wheel drive so it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
gonna be a sh all wheel drive so it
should<00:00:37.050> definitely<00:00:37.200> hit<00:00:38.100> zero<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> 60<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
should definitely hit zero to 60 in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
should definitely hit zero to 60 in
under<00:00:39.469> 4.5<00:00:40.469> seconds<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.730> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
under 4.5 seconds that's what I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.080 
under 4.5 seconds that's what I'm
guessing<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:44.040> gonna<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> dual<00:00:44.850> clutch

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
guessing it's gonna have a dual clutch

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.020 
guessing it's gonna have a dual clutch
transmission<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.399> it's<00:00:47.399> also<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.879> have

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
transmission and it's also gonna have

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
transmission and it's also gonna have
its<00:00:48.180> own<00:00:48.329> electric<00:00:48.840> motor<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.680> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
its own electric motor so it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
its own electric motor so it's
definitely<00:00:50.250> gonna<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.329> feel

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
definitely gonna be you know feel

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
be a fuel-efficient car it's gonna be a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.469 
be a fuel-efficient car it's gonna be a
hybrid<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.119> /<00:01:09.570> exotic<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.560> guess<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
hybrid kind of / exotic I guess and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.020 
hybrid kind of / exotic I guess and
currently<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.659> being<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.890> through

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
currently it's being going through

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.510 
currently it's being going through
production<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.210> Ohio<00:01:15.689> right<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.520> they

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
production in Ohio right now and they

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
production in Ohio right now and they
actually<00:01:17.700> said<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.659> gonna<00:01:18.869> hit<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
actually said that it's gonna hit the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.640 
actually said that it's gonna hit the
markets<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.820> three<00:01:21.090> years<00:01:21.330> maybe

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
markets in about two three years maybe

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.700 
markets in about two three years maybe
so<00:01:22.650> we're<00:01:22.860> probably<00:01:22.979> looking<00:01:23.400> around

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
so we're probably looking around

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
so we're probably looking around
2014-2015<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.610> other<00:01:26.820> than<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.450> don't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
2014-2015 but other than that we don't

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
2014-2015 but other than that we don't
have<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:28.110> information<00:01:28.439> Acura<00:01:29.220> has<00:01:29.310> not

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
have much information Acura has not

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.749 
have much information Acura has not
released<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.659> yet<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.500> car<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.549> we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
released much yet about this car but we

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
released much yet about this car but we
do<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.420> currently<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.259> through

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
do know it is currently going through

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.950 
do know it is currently going through
production<00:01:34.920> stage<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> that's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
production stage right now and that's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.770 
production stage right now and that's
pretty<00:01:37.380> much<00:01:37.530> sums<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.240> also<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.509> price

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
pretty much sums it up also the price

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
pretty much sums it up also the price
range<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.500> thinking<00:01:41.040> probably<00:01:41.310> around<00:01:41.729> 50

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
range I'm thinking probably around 50

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.530 
range I'm thinking probably around 50
grand<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:43.140> maybe<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.619> hundred<00:01:44.040> grand

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
grand to about maybe a hundred grand

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.760 
grand to about maybe a hundred grand
could<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> little<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.170> over<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> hundred

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
could be a little bit over a hundred

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.469 
could be a little bit over a hundred
gram<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.399> too<00:01:47.610> sure<00:01:47.850> yet<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.240> that's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
gram we're not too sure yet but that's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
gram we're not too sure yet but that's
pretty<00:01:48.930> much<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.259> information<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.130> have
