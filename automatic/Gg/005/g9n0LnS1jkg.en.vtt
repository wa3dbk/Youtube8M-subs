it was in the single digits where we
were<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> city<00:02:00.119> alone<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.600> in

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
were at just in the city alone it was in

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
were at just in the city alone it was in
the<00:02:00.750> single<00:02:00.990> digits<00:02:01.159> everything<00:02:02.159> was

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the single digits everything was

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.980 
the single digits everything was
freezing<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.850> was<00:02:02.939> ice<00:02:03.149> everywhere<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
freezing there was ice everywhere but on

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
freezing there was ice everywhere but on
top<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> park<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:05.969> bus

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
top of that where we had to park our bus

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
top of that where we had to park our bus
was<00:02:06.630> pretty<00:02:07.320> much<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.649> giant<00:02:07.920> wind

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
was pretty much in this giant wind

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
was pretty much in this giant wind
tunnel<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.030> every<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.539> had<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> walk<00:02:09.869> out

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
tunnel so every time we had to walk out

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
tunnel so every time we had to walk out
of<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> arena<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> try<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> bus<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
of the arena and try to go to the bus to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.490 
of the arena and try to go to the bus to
get<00:02:11.819> closer<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.510> go<00:02:12.690> back<00:02:12.870> into<00:02:13.050> where

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
get closer to go back into where

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.610 
get closer to go back into where
ian<00:02:13.710> or<00:02:13.800> whatever<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.390> negative<00:02:15.960> 15

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
ian or whatever it was like negative 15

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.890 
ian or whatever it was like negative 15
or<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:16.980> degrees<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.450> cold<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.840> was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
or so degrees it was so cold it was

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.030 
or so degrees it was so cold it was
definitely<00:02:19.140> below<00:02:19.470> zero<00:02:19.740> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.950> windchill

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
definitely below zero with the windchill

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.680 
definitely below zero with the windchill
because<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> wind<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:20.820> blowing<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.360> 30

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
because the wind was blowing like 30

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780 
because the wind was blowing like 30
plus<00:02:22.080> miles<00:02:22.350> an<00:02:22.500> hour<00:02:22.620> trying<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> run<00:02:23.640> back

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
plus miles an hour trying to run back

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.550 
plus miles an hour trying to run back
and<00:02:23.820> forth<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.320> arena

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and forth so if you're in the arena
