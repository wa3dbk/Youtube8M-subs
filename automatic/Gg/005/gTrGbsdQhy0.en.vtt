00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
she's just walking toward you just don't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
she's just walking toward you just don't
get<00:01:17.490> hit<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.509> keep<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> running

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
get hit by that just keep on running

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
get hit by that just keep on running
away<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.780> second<00:01:22.320> attack<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.649> when<00:01:22.950> she'll<00:01:23.159> go

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
away the second attack is when she'll go

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
away the second attack is when she'll go
toward<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.939> side<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.509> start<00:01:24.780> shooting

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
toward one side and start shooting

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.520 
toward one side and start shooting
projectiles<00:01:26.420> which<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.720> need<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.899> find<00:01:28.289> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
projectiles which you need to find a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
projectiles which you need to find a
hiding<00:01:28.979> spot<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.630> fast

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
hiding spot because they're really fast

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
hiding spot because they're really fast
unless<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.920> jump<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.399> dodge<00:01:32.580> out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
unless you can just jump and dodge out

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
unless you can just jump and dodge out
of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.940> way<00:01:33.000> each<00:01:33.240> time<00:01:33.270> perfectly<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
of the way each time perfectly but I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.870 
of the way each time perfectly but I
doubt<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.789> that<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> next<00:01:38.340> attack<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
doubt you can do that the next attack is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
doubt you can do that the next attack is
when<00:01:39.299> she<00:01:39.509> gets<00:01:39.659> close<00:01:39.750> sometimes<00:01:40.470> she

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
when she gets close sometimes she

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.359 
when she gets close sometimes she
expands<00:01:41.880> herself<00:01:42.330> out<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.020> she'll<00:01:43.649> slam<00:01:44.009> down

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
expands herself out and she'll slam down

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:59.140 
expands herself out and she'll slam down
her<00:01:44.750> arms<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.020> Boulder<00:01:46.560> things

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.280

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
or even the the floating the floating

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.060 
or even the the floating the floating
power<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.110> another<00:02:36.320> one<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.590> her<00:02:36.770> attacks

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070

power this is another one of her attacks
which<00:02:37.550> turns<00:02:37.970> into<00:02:38.240> like<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:39.080> line<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.650> just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
which turns into like this line and just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.430 
which turns into like this line and just
charges<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.630> straight<00:02:41.630> away<00:02:41.690> after<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.230> line
