Hello. My name is Janet,
and I work

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:13.367
at the Laurent Clerc
National Deaf Education Center,

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.333
known as the Clerc Center.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.500
The Clerc Center is
pleased to announce

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100
the awarding of
a contract for the development

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.367
of ASL content standards.

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:26.166
Nationwide, states have
established standards

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:31.567
and benchmarks to outline what
students should know

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:35.900
in various academic areas,
including English

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.800
and other languages.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Thus far, however, there
have been no formal standards

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.600
or benchmarks
for ASL learning in grades K-12.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.233
It is important to be able

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.834
to assess students' ASL skills
by comparing them

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:53.367
against established
standards and benchmarks

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.266
so that teachers can plan instruction accordingly.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.300
Ultimately, this will help
students become fluent

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.900
in both ASL and English.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.700
For a while now, teachers,
professionals,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.734
and parents have noted the need
for ASL standards.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.767
The Clerc Center agreed

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:17.200
and released
a Request for Proposals (RFP)

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.233
in the fall of
2010 for the development

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:23.467
of ASL standards
for grades K-12.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.300
Through this process,
individuals and groups

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.800
were invited
to submit proposals.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.266
Now, the Clerc Center is
pleased to announce

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.600
that the contract has been
awarded to a group

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.600
that includes teachers,
specialists,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.533
researchers, and administrators.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.767
This is an experienced,
innovative group

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:51.000
with expertise in deaf
education, language

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.367
and literacy development,
ASL assessment,

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.367
and ASL instruction.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.400
The group is composed
of researchers and educators

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.834
from a variety of
universities and schools.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:11.000
The participating universities
are Boston University,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.900
the University
of Manitoba in Canada,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800
the University of
California-San Diego,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.333
and the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.433
The schools consist of

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:29.967
the California School for the
Deaf-Riverside,

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.233
the Indiana School for the Deaf
in Indianapolis,

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:35.367
The Learning Center
for the Deaf in Massachusetts.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:38.266
This is a special
group indeed.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:43.367
This group will develop
the ASL standards.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.300
The Clerc Center looks
forward to collaborating

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500
with this group, and will
share periodic updates

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.533
on the work of ASL
standards development.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:03:01.033
The goal is to disseminate the
completed standards in 2013.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:02.800
For more information,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.700

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.867
Thank you.
