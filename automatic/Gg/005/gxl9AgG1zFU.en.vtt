00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.029
 moto gp has always strived for maximum 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 realistic and there is a main 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.400
 grinder and start zero him tracer 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.240
 simplified physical management models that 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.460
 same pi never compromised 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.680
 new game follows the tradition of the motorcycle 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.440
 adequately responds to player commands 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.840
 driver behavior changes depending 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.540
 from the situation on the track a lot of attention 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 given motorcycle tuning here is 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.839
 many characteristics and parameters 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.720
 which can be changed 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.790
 that just the eyes run up allowed 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.150
 motorcycle preparation error 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.699
 lost the race no compromise on 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 for a long time playing 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.619
 motorcycles tried not to demonstrate 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.809
 the pilot's eyes race is usually all 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.239
 came down to the world from a third party like 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.350
 some gta and shading camera 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.020
 put in front of bikes or top helmet 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.360
 moto g p13 destroys silly traditions 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.060
 has one of the available cameras 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 right inside the pilot's helmet 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.729
 we begin to see what is happening with our eyes 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.909
 racer and this is the kind of entertainment 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.250
 see for yourself the helmet narrows the field of view on 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.079
 glass fall raindrops occurring 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.550
 on the side of us in general goes beyond 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.910
 of understanding 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 someone will say what realism is only 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.830
 spoil the game but no in reality look and helmet and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.720
 make it more interesting additives you 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.120
 stop using the usual 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.430
 interface and look at the speedometer and 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.640
 other sensors just dropping a look 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.460
 down on the dashboard 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.100
 moto g 13 is one of a kind game 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.260
 yes we know a lot of games in which 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
 used motorcycles we know a lot 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.230
 simulators but these two paths and rarely 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.270
 intersects usually games about motorcycling 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.600
 is an acrobatic 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.730
 arcades like evolution trial 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.410
 proposed to overcome a difficult landscape 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.820
 and look at what's going on 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.460
 simulators in turn usually 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 turn out to be 4 wheeled want 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.190
 Realism run test drive 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 unlimited 2 or not for speed shift 2 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.360
 the result of moto g by 13 is in 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.110
 unique position 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.730
 this is exactly the game that brings together 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 motor sport fun seriousness 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.720
 simulator 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.510
 an experienced rider will be closely within 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.730
 single races having tamed the motorcycle you 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.310
 want to fight with other players not 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.950
 moto g p13 problem offers not only 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.970
 standard network races with random 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.239
 opponents 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.880
 but also a whole target championship system 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.920
 where errors 1 arrival can be corrected in 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.380
 subsequent and vice versa winning the championship 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.250
 on motorcycle racing even virtual 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.950
 good achievement true 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.620
 moto g 513 follows the classic formula 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.080
 game modes in racing standard 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.120
 single heats accompanying here 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.460
 several variations for example 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.860
 the world championship is a long 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.190
 fight for the championship title at all 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.560
 moto jeeps are not worth taking turns 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.510
 confused it with a career here taking under 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 newbie rider control we will 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.040
 gradually grow leader out of him 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.580
 improving my bike consider 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.350
 suggestions from various teams 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.230
 the usual mode taim atak represent 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.959
 a rider with a timer 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.970
 gaining new meaning here is the best 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.950
 way to customize your motorcycle 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.200
 instantly test it on 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.390
 carrying on the track of course there 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.230
 network mode and to which I spoke above 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.540
 he is unique of course two-wheeled sport 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.720
 not as popular in our country as football 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.180
 but moto gp will still delight those 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.370
 rare enthusiast developers postponed 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.420
 aside fantasy and not only 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.090
 modeled 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.340
 several dozen really existing 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.720
 motorcycles and race tracks but also 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.420
 received permission to use 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.790
 names of real moto gp racers 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.060
 there is no convention only real 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.459
 motorcycle tracks and pilots 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.419
 there is one interesting element for fans 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.460
 moto gp 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.040
 there is a tape of events in the game 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.350
 real championship would seem simple 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.860
 news line immediately special 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.470
 strength 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.449
 but it's not quite like running your 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.060
 virtual championship you can 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.120
 play dozens of scenarios from a number of 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.160
 what if your favorite tip loses 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.470
 so help him at least 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.470
 virtual track similar things 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.060
 Engage Formula 1 and Football Do 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.820
 you have friends who 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.979
 arrange the championships of their dreams and feb 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.870
 13 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.389
 this year we will see another shift 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.000
 generation of game consoles which 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.460
 will make a new development graphic 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.639
 technology nonetheless oldies 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.039
 still in moto g case 13 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.400
 look very decent even on 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 modern yardstick quality weather 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.650
 reflection effects on the sun in the shade and 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.960
 highlights and blues appearing on 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.409
 maximum speed do not give graphics 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.469
 slide into the primitive world 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.059
 then beams developers really 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.369
 modeled the motorcycle in detail 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:32.789
 central element of the game and if 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:35.279
 Moto g p13 statistics can still cause 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.039
 questions in motion the game turns 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.550
 one of the most beautiful races of the last 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.550
 years old
