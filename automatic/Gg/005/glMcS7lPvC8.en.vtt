00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
okay so today is the day when I finished

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.499 
okay so today is the day when I finished
it<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:11.300> and<00:00:13.429> it<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> little<00:00:15.000> bit<00:00:15.150> hard<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it up and it was a little bit hard to

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.099 
it up and it was a little bit hard to
put<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.350> fit<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.279> engine<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.480> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
put that fit that engine in there as you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.220 
put that fit that engine in there as you
see<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.640> had<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.910> take<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> cover<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> air

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
see I had to take the cover for the air

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
see I had to take the cover for the air
filter<00:00:22.740> off<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:28.130> had<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.160> cut<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.260> tank<00:00:31.260> cap<00:00:31.820> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
filter off I had to cut the tank cap in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
filter off I had to cut the tank cap in
order<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.480> able<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.840> take<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.290> off<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.680> put

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
order to be able to take it off and put

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
order to be able to take it off and put
some<00:00:35.309> fuel<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:38.059> other<00:00:39.059> than<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.690> there

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
some fuel in it other than that there

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
some fuel in it other than that there
was<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> couple<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.309> issues<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.640> wiring

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
was a couple of issues with wiring

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.200 
was a couple of issues with wiring
because<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.040> raised<00:00:44.309> only<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because this one raised only has the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
because this one raised only has the
shutoff<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.320> by<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> engine<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
shutoff right here by the engine you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
shutoff right here by the engine you
know<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.629> had<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> convert<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.180> work<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
know I had to convert it to work for the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.060 
know I had to convert it to work for the
kill<00:00:52.739> 2h<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> work<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> handle<00:00:54.980> it's<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
kill 2h to work on the handle it's a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
kill 2h to work on the handle it's a
little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> power<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> engine<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
little bit of power in this engine and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
little bit of power in this engine and
I'm<00:00:58.739> surprised<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.879> fast<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I'm surprised it is it is fast and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'm surprised it is it is fast and
strong<00:01:04.229> enough<00:01:04.939> more<00:01:05.939> than<00:01:06.119> enough<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
strong enough more than enough for this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
strong enough more than enough for this

to mess with governor yesterday is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
to mess with governor yesterday is
actually<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.439> probably<00:01:31.650> can't<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually you probably can't see it it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually you probably can't see it it
sits<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.810> underneath<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
sits right there right underneath the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.789 
sits right there right underneath the
tank<00:01:36.540> fuel<00:01:36.960> tank<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.970> had<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.979> pull<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
tank fuel tank I had to pull back the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.700 
tank fuel tank I had to pull back the
tensioner<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.670> chain<00:01:45.380> because<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> would

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
tensioner for the chain because it would

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
tensioner for the chain because it would
be<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.060> torque

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
be on them in the way of a torque

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
be on them in the way of a torque
converter<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.890> works<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:51.090> perfect<00:01:52.700> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
converter which works just perfect I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.929 
converter which works just perfect I
managed<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> Center<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
managed to kind of Center it and it is

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.959 
managed to kind of Center it and it is
pretty<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.159> fine<00:01:59.430> because

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
pretty good I think it's fine because

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.770 
pretty good I think it's fine because
they<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.530> head<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.969> engine<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.600> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
they the head of the engine is right in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.039 
they the head of the engine is right in
the<00:02:03.869> center<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.570> enough

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the center and so I have just enough

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.860 
the center and so I have just enough
room<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:08.190> left<00:02:09.410> legs<00:02:10.410> rest

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
room to put my left legs rest

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:25.020 
room to put my left legs rest
the<00:02:12.870> right<00:02:13.049> one<00:02:13.879> so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.180 

I'm<00:02:25.570> gonna<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.200> give<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.560> try<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.970> know

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
I'm gonna have to give it a try you know

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.070 
I'm gonna have to give it a try you know
run<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.460> bit<00:02:30.850> more<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.450> actually

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
run it a little bit more I was actually

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.790 
run it a little bit more I was actually
doing<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.680> break-in<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.230> would<00:02:35.230> recommend

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
doing a break-in I would recommend

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.240 
doing a break-in I would recommend
changing<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.460> oil<00:02:36.630> any<00:02:37.630> engine<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.320> know

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
changing the oil any engine you know

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.380 
changing the oil any engine you know
work<00:02:39.910> with<00:02:39.940> any<00:02:40.510> engine<00:02:41.130> would<00:02:42.130> need<00:02:42.340> a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
work with any engine would need a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.850 
work with any engine would need a
two-stroke<00:02:43.390> or<00:02:43.570> four-stroke<00:02:43.630> needs<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
two-stroke or four-stroke needs the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.350 
two-stroke or four-stroke needs the
breaking<00:02:45.460> process<00:02:47.310> water<00:02:48.310> oil<00:02:48.760> needs<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.270> be

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
breaking process water oil needs to be

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.070 
breaking process water oil needs to be
replaced<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> new<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.370> idle<00:02:54.850> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
replaced to the new one you can idle it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.960 
replaced to the new one you can idle it
that's<00:02:56.080> that's<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.920> best<00:02:57.220> way<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.430> do<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.760> you

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
that's that's the best way to do it you

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.410 
that's that's the best way to do it you
can<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.180> leave<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.540> idling<00:02:59.050> I<00:03:00.180> don't<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.240> if

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
can just leave it idling I don't know if

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.670 
can just leave it idling I don't know if
you<00:03:01.570> can<00:03:01.750> longer<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.320> can<00:03:02.500> better<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:04.680> fuel

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
you can longer you can better it is fuel

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.210 
you can longer you can better it is fuel

just<00:03:06.400> leave<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:07.240> know<00:03:07.330> what<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.750> did<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.050> just

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
just leave it you know what I did I just

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.590 
just leave it you know what I did I just
left<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.800> in<00:03:08.860> garage<00:03:09.220> left<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.970> doors<00:03:10.180> open<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
left it in garage left the doors open a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.570 
left it in garage left the doors open a
little<00:03:10.720> bit<00:03:10.870> enough<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.970> let<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.020> run<00:03:17.580> five

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
little bit enough and let it run five

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.400 
little bit enough and let it run five
six<00:03:19.360> seven<00:03:19.750> hours<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.820> not<00:03:21.910> using<00:03:22.360> much<00:03:22.540> heal

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
six seven hours it's not using much heal

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.510 
six seven hours it's not using much heal
so<00:03:23.710> it<00:03:24.460> might<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:25.440> less<00:03:26.440> than<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.710> tank<00:03:29.520> let's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
so it might be less than a tank let's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.110 
so it might be less than a tank let's
fire<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> up<00:03:31.330> let's<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.350> actually

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
fire it up let's see what it actually

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.750 
fire it up let's see what it actually
this<00:03:34.120> off<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.950> see<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.690> exhaust<00:03:37.690> system

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.720 

this<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.970> pretty<00:03:43.330> much<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> same<00:03:43.959> size<00:03:44.260> as<00:03:47.730> as

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
this is pretty much the same size as as

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.440 
this is pretty much the same size as as
a<00:03:48.790> manifold<00:03:49.300> what<00:03:49.930> comes<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> engine

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
a manifold what comes out of the engine

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.690 
a manifold what comes out of the engine
so<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.959> thought<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.860> gonna<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> little<00:03:54.489> bit

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
so I thought it's gonna be a little bit

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.330 
so I thought it's gonna be a little bit
bigger<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.390> nope<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.620> size<00:03:56.830> so<00:03:57.310> I

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
bigger but nope this is the size so I

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.110 
bigger but nope this is the size so I
just<00:03:57.730> grabbed<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.300> pipe<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:59.260> matched<00:03:59.560> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
just grabbed the pipe that matched it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.070 
just grabbed the pipe that matched it
you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.330> had<00:04:02.320> some<00:04:02.560> people<00:04:03.720> I'll<00:04:04.720> get<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:04.959> on

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
you know had some people I'll get it on

00:04:05.080 --> 00:05:27.050 
you know had some people I'll get it on
for<00:04:05.350> me<00:04:06.120> okay<00:04:07.120> let's<00:04:07.720> try<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> part<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.380> out

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.250 

took<00:05:28.060> me<00:05:28.180> about<00:05:28.390> three<00:05:28.660> days<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:29.110> put

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
took me about three days to put

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.410 
took me about three days to put
everything<00:05:29.530> together<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.980> lot<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.240> lots<00:05:34.240> of

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
everything together and a lot of lots of

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.780 
everything together and a lot of lots of
patience<00:05:36.510> like<00:05:37.510> I<00:05:37.570> said<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.900> lot<00:05:38.140> of<00:05:38.260> parts

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.080 

doesn't<00:05:42.790> fit<00:05:43.180> but<00:05:43.960> uh<00:05:44.020> there<00:05:44.560> is<00:05:44.680> waste<00:05:45.090> this

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
doesn't fit but uh there is waste this

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.600 
doesn't fit but uh there is waste this
fuel<00:05:46.780> tank<00:05:47.110> cap<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:48.160> actually<00:05:49.050> pops<00:05:50.050> off<00:05:50.610> so

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
fuel tank cap it actually pops off so

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.430 
fuel tank cap it actually pops off so
this<00:05:51.760> is<00:05:51.820> original<00:05:52.450> one<00:05:52.630> but<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.870> just<00:05:53.290> took

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
this is original one but I just took

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.100 
this is original one but I just took
that<00:05:53.620> good<00:05:53.770> that<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.940> top<00:05:55.330> of<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.660> basically

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
that good that the top of it basically

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.670 
that good that the top of it basically
and<00:05:56.680> then<00:05:56.950> it<00:05:57.100> fits<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.990> didn't<00:05:58.990> have<00:05:59.230> to<00:05:59.470> buy

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
and then it fits I didn't have to buy

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.140 
and then it fits I didn't have to buy
anything<00:06:00.310> else<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.710> managed<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.580> fit<00:06:04.000> it

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
anything else on it I managed to fit it

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.070 
anything else on it I managed to fit it
in<00:06:04.330> just<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.050> way<00:06:05.230> it<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:06.450> engine<00:06:07.450> now<00:06:07.600> engine

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
in just the way it is engine now engine

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.070 
in just the way it is engine now engine
plate<00:06:08.730> some<00:06:09.730> people<00:06:10.030> they're<00:06:10.240> getting<00:06:10.510> engine

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
plate some people they're getting engine

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.440 
plate some people they're getting engine
plates<00:06:11.350> the<00:06:11.680> custom<00:06:12.130> ones<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.640> you<00:06:13.060> see<00:06:13.270> what<00:06:13.420> I

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
plates the custom ones I you see what I

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.380 
plates the custom ones I you see what I
did<00:06:13.600> this<00:06:14.590> one<00:06:14.890> I<00:06:15.340> just<00:06:15.430> used<00:06:15.820> the<00:06:16.030> nuts

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
did this one I just used the nuts

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.740 
did this one I just used the nuts
in<00:06:16.720> order<00:06:17.080> to<00:06:17.320> be<00:06:18.040> able<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.700> lift<00:06:18.970> that<00:06:19.090> corner

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
in order to be able to lift that corner

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.890 
in order to be able to lift that corner
just<00:06:20.760> to<00:06:21.760> adjust<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:22.150> chain<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.420> little<00:06:22.750> bit

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
just to adjust the chain a little bit

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.330 
just to adjust the chain a little bit
and<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:26.080> be<00:06:26.230> able<00:06:26.380> to<00:06:26.560> play<00:06:26.860> with<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.310> little

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
and to be able to play with it a little

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.950 
and to be able to play with it a little
bit<00:06:27.700> but<00:06:27.940> uh<00:06:27.970> this<00:06:28.480> is<00:06:28.800> very<00:06:29.800> simple<00:06:30.960> just

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
bit but uh this is very simple just

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.770 
bit but uh this is very simple just
drilled<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.320> holes<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:33.450> don't<00:06:34.450> have<00:06:34.600> the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
drilled the holes I don't have the

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.030 
drilled the holes I don't have the
engine<00:06:35.200> in<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.410> perfect<00:06:36.420> horizontal

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
engine in the perfect horizontal

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.400 
engine in the perfect horizontal
position<00:06:39.040> though<00:06:39.250> um<00:06:39.900> it's<00:06:40.900> still<00:06:41.020> working

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
position though um it's still working

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.360 
position though um it's still working
hopefully<00:06:42.070> it's<00:06:42.220> not<00:06:42.340> gonna<00:06:42.550> change<00:06:44.220> a<00:06:45.220> lot

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
hopefully it's not gonna change a lot

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.200 
hopefully it's not gonna change a lot
for<00:06:45.700> me<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:46.120> just<00:06:46.680> raised<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:47.860> front<00:06:48.160> of<00:06:48.340> front

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
for me I just raised the front of front

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.010 
for me I just raised the front of front
wheel<00:06:49.780> up<00:06:50.050> a<00:06:50.320> little<00:06:50.650> bit<00:06:50.890> and<00:06:51.720> added<00:06:52.720> the<00:06:52.990> oil

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
wheel up a little bit and added the oil

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.450 
wheel up a little bit and added the oil
the<00:06:53.470> way<00:06:53.590> it's<00:06:53.710> supposed<00:06:53.980> to<00:06:54.100> be<00:06:54.280> on<00:06:54.430> a

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
the way it's supposed to be on a

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.210 
the way it's supposed to be on a
horizontal<00:06:55.150> level<00:06:55.530> and<00:06:56.530> checked<00:06:56.920> it<00:06:57.070> and

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
horizontal level and checked it and

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.140 
horizontal level and checked it and
closed<00:06:58.030> it<00:06:58.210> up<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.540> raised<00:06:58.720> it<00:06:58.870> down<00:07:03.150> so

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
closed it up and raised it down so

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150 
closed it up and raised it down so
that's<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.600> for<00:07:04.810> today<00:07:05.080> you<00:07:05.260> know<00:07:05.440> thank<00:07:06.100> you
