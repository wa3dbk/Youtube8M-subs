let's<00:01:33.300> go<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.630> blade<00:01:33.810> msr<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> set

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
let's go to the blade msr I have it set

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.770 
let's go to the blade msr I have it set
up<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> advanced<00:01:35.790> swashplate<00:01:36.120> settings

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
up to the advanced swashplate settings

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.510 
up to the advanced swashplate settings
you<00:01:36.870> put<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.200> control<00:01:37.650> arms<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> longer

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you put the control arms on the longer

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
you put the control arms on the longer
links<00:01:38.850> gives<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> more<00:01:39.840> response<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
links gives it more response and the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
links gives it more response and the
quicker<00:01:40.830> response<00:01:41.480> so<00:01:42.480> we'll<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.720> ahead<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
quicker response so we'll go ahead and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:02:01.020 
quicker response so we'll go ahead and
see<00:01:43.140> how<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.440> flies<00:01:43.710> outside<00:01:43.950> now

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.750 

this<00:02:01.659> thing<00:02:01.869> can<00:02:02.049> go<00:02:02.110> much<00:02:02.350> quicker<00:02:02.619> around

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:29.429 

try<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.820> keep<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.119> in<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.240> camera<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.630> hope<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.020> am

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:38.210 

outside<00:02:30.439> of<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:30.620> first<00:02:30.859> second<00:02:31.189> there

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.740 

hopefully<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> guys<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
hopefully you guys can see it on this

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
hopefully you guys can see it on this

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
got to get new screws or new top rotors

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.950 
got to get new screws or new top rotors
they<00:04:35.100> go<00:04:35.250> back<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.669> but<00:04:35.880> one<00:04:36.180> crash<00:04:36.449> usually
