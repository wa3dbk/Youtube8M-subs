00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.770
 hello everyone we meet for 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.510
 the remote control test to them for the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.349
 camera on the s70 so first of all I 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.720
 will you talk a little bit about 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.210
 accessories that I received with so here 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.920
 we have a velcro with tape 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 double faces must allow the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.949
 to put 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.500
 here I think it must come behind 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.040
 to see the velcro t I think we say 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.510
 like that new dig on the ps that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.070
 is there must be able to come to settle on 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.190
 various accessories and so we come 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 fix the remote like these on 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.210
 his clip this just withdraws 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.149
 very easily 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 we also have to kind of a dragon 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.969
 velcro that has to come directly here 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.420
 on the remote to be able to 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.310
 fix like these on the wrist and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.880
 able to fly it or directly on a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.159
 handlebar or various accessories 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.229
 then concerning the connection between these 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.460
 two elements I have a little trouble 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.630
 at first I did not understand how 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.299
 it works and so I make you a 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.119
 little simple demo so for 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.590
 start we're going but the camera is going 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.509
 wait for this one if it turns on 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.200
 I see myself well and then I'm going 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.590
 turn on the wifi connection so I'm going 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.840
 wait for the logo to appear at 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.299
 the go we have to see him for 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.220
 can enjoy making the connection 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.979
 so it takes a little while 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.679
 this is it is there is in place it is 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.099
 see here so then I take my 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.460
 remote control stop button and 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:57.110
 recordings 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.540
 in action five seconds 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.900
 then we wait for white hot spec pe 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.640
 so once I have that I support 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.009
 here on this little button the red of the top 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.020
 a few seconds and normally that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.050
 should here connect 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.950
 that's almost connected now 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.950
 I press the green button 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.610
 go green button 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.800
 and 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.200
 hop 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.200
 or the red button is the choice is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.660
 one of them must work and there 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.030
 this is where I have my logo that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 posted here I have the connection of the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.860
 remote control that got started and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.470
 we see the little light here that lights up 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.440
 and then goes off once we wait 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.970
 these parameters to know at the beginning I 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.680
 galÃ©rais a little bit because 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.300
 I could not connect it and I was 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 in 720 mode because I was doing some 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.610
 slowed down so it was not working the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 everything so I had to go into 1080 mode and 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.400
 there it worked 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.200
 practically the first time in 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.959
 some small two info on this 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.819
 remote control 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.450
 concerning the taking of photographs and the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.190
 video socket 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.709
 so first know that 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.140
 to take a video in support once 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.670
 to enter the video mode and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.440
 then a second time the room has 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.180
 taken first time because I have not 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.640
 done actions and for example if I want 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.370
 to make a photo that aja then stop 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.840
 I press once on the photo mode for 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.420
 that they go into photo mode on the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.790
 camera and then a second time for 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.260
 to take a picture 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.420
 the agent we take a picture if I want 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.620
 get into the video mode 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.530
 I press once on the month of videos 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.389
 there I went back into video mode and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.130
 jora then a second time to launch 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.710
 the video shooting that starts on it 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.200
 see here on the screen so here I'm doing stop 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.790
 here and then here we have functions 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.220
 to choose the big angles the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.900
 small angles so the room in angle 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.710
 I validate it in medium validates it in 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.170
 fed up with the game the valid and very small 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.920
 so validate me what interests me 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.630
 is the wide-angle and therefore there 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.870
 it was a few things about 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.650
 my ben here is this remote that has 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.770
 air tight 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.030
 here we have the usb thing but a month ago 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.340
 with my little nails 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.720
 I can not open it, it's impossible 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.270
 once a small screwdriver or a small 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.040
 sharp thing so much better we have a small 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.900
 hang here to pass a thread and to 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.630
 dragons that will allow us to have it at 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.280
 wrist basket do not lose it but 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.140
 otherwise she is very nice 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.490
 practice we will see what it gives in 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.020
 the future days I think I'll do 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.040
 some small tests and other videos 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.930
 So here but we what turns this 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.010
 this little presentation and then I hope 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.140
 we will be very soon 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.140
 go hello to all ciao
