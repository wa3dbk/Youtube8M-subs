00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
running as a virtual machine now a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
running as a virtual machine now a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
all your drivers very easy wear when you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.569 
all your drivers very easy wear when you
hackintosh<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> full<00:00:59.219> operating

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
hackintosh you do get the full operating

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
hackintosh you do get the full operating
system<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> trouble

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
system but you have a lot of trouble

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.969 
system but you have a lot of trouble
subscribers<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.680> unless<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.979> custom
