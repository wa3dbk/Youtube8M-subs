the<00:00:31.230> srf<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:31.890> much<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the srf too much and here you can see I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
the srf too much and here you can see I
took<00:00:33.540> quite<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> curbing<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.160> can

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
took quite a bit of the curbing you can

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.889 
took quite a bit of the curbing you can
get<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.609> cut<00:00:35.820> course<00:00:36.059> penalty<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.600> you're<00:00:36.750> too

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
get a cut course penalty if you're too

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.389 
get a cut course penalty if you're too
far<00:00:37.109> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> inside<00:00:37.679> so<00:00:37.949> of<00:00:38.010> course<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
far to the inside so of course be

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.509 
far to the inside so of course be
careful<00:00:39.019> after<00:00:40.019> apex<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.679> track<00:00:40.920> dips<00:00:41.219> again

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.799 
careful after apex the track dips again
and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.789> car<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.149> again<00:00:42.420> pick<00:00:42.690> up

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
