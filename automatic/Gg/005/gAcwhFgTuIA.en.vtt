you<00:03:55.900> know<00:03:56.050> time<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.890> exaggeration<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.730> has<00:03:57.850> a

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
you know time to exaggeration it has a

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.460 
you know time to exaggeration it has a
burn<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.510> because<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.930> an<00:03:58.990> alcoholic

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
burn to it because it's an alcoholic

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.370 
burn to it because it's an alcoholic
beverage<00:03:59.800> but<00:04:00.640> honestly<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.780> American<00:04:02.230> honey

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
beverage but honestly the American honey

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.770 
beverage but honestly the American honey
wine<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.770> lot<00:04:02.920> smoother<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:04.000> saying<00:04:04.510> that

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
wine is a lot smoother and saying that

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.240 
wine is a lot smoother and saying that
I'm<00:04:04.960> guessing<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.440> American<00:04:05.800> honey<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.160> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
I'm guessing the American honey it's the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.190 
I'm guessing the American honey it's the
one<00:04:06.430> that's<00:04:06.550> more<00:04:06.790> expensive<00:04:07.000> due<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.840> us<00:04:07.990> is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
one that's more expensive due to us is

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.710 
one that's more expensive due to us is
smooth<00:04:08.740> and<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.280> has<00:04:09.460> more<00:04:09.910> alcohol<00:04:10.180> content

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
smooth and it has more alcohol content

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.950 
smooth and it has more alcohol content
to<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.260> which<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.070> only<00:04:12.340> 1%<00:04:12.610> but<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
to it which is only 1% but it's the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.020 
to it which is only 1% but it's the
reason<00:04:14.110> making<00:04:14.470> more<00:04:14.620> expensive<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.790> I'm

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
reason making more expensive and I'm

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.400 
reason making more expensive and I'm
guessing<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.810> since<00:04:16.989> it's<00:04:17.140> smooth

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
guessing that this one since it's smooth

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.080 
guessing that this one since it's smooth
it's<00:04:17.680> probably<00:04:17.950> been<00:04:18.070> distilled<00:04:18.459> more<00:04:18.730> so

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
it's probably been distilled more so

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.720 
it's probably been distilled more so
they<00:04:19.270> had<00:04:19.540> to<00:04:19.630> do<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> lot<00:04:19.989> more<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:21.549> raise

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
they had to do a lot more to it to raise

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.040 
they had to do a lot more to it to raise
the<00:04:21.880> price<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.510> doesn't<00:04:22.660> really<00:04:22.870> say

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
the price on it it doesn't really say

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.020 
the price on it it doesn't really say
much<00:04:23.080> on<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.680> little<00:04:23.950> airplane<00:04:24.490> bottles<00:04:24.520> I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
much on this little airplane bottles I

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.140 
much on this little airplane bottles I
apologize<00:04:25.600> so<00:04:26.169> I'm<00:04:26.500> kind<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.880> only<00:04:27.880> working

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
apologize so I'm kind of only working

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.659 
apologize so I'm kind of only working
off<00:04:28.270> with<00:04:28.450> what<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.630> got<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.770> I'm<00:04:30.430> gonna<00:04:30.550> just

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
off with what I got and I'm gonna just

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.220 
off with what I got and I'm gonna just
go<00:04:30.820> ahead<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.120> guess<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:33.100> actual<00:04:33.520> honey

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
go ahead and guess that the actual honey

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.050 
go ahead and guess that the actual honey
American<00:04:35.230> honey<00:04:35.410> one<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.070> more<00:04:36.790> expensive

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
American honey one is the more expensive

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.630 
American honey one is the more expensive
one<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.810> saying<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.950> was<00:04:39.220> a<00:04:39.280> person<00:04:39.580> I

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
one and saying that I was a person I

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.820 
one and saying that I was a person I
enjoy<00:04:40.150> drinking<00:04:40.720> honey<00:04:40.900> flavored<00:04:41.260> whiskey<00:04:41.650> I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
would definitely go ahead and just pay

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.150 
would definitely go ahead and just pay
that<00:04:43.330> extra<00:04:43.690> 10<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.110> 15<00:04:44.440> dollars<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.890> just<00:04:44.980> get

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
a big bottle that would be the best

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.440 
a big bottle that would be the best
thing<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.320> do<00:04:47.530> instead<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.860> uh<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.370> small<00:04:48.940> bottle
