00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.010
 rc 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.010
 today the rule 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.289
 the american network 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.949
 although their story 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 this issue is senat 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.080
 the climates of our planet are not always the same they change in the course 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.980
 of the day with some time periods 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.600
 the coldest hottest global temperature depending on the period of the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.210
 story 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 it is clear that these changes do not occur from night to day 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.950
 but over very long periods 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.510
 hundreds or even thousands 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.940
 some of them happen repeatedly are called themselves 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 between the occasional builders 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.540
 during the time of the Roman Empire 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.950
 in the time of jesus 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.790
 for 400 years the earth went through a very cold period 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.960
 the closer it was to it it was repeated much in 1550 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.740
 in 1850 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.130
 the inmates were crazy and cold in the cool summers and 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 in this period the children are called small ice ages 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.410
 because it was icy 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.189
 because it is the most visible signal 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.189
 is the extent of the area covered by ice 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.100
 18,000 dead when the last true ice age was at its peak. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.940
 land was 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.720
 totally different 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 It was difficult to find a warm place after the ice covered almost 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.810
 all of eurasia 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.320
 create from north africa 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.670
 but how can we know that these changes in crime happened 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 av many thousands of years people know how to write 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.689
 in general writes about their lives and the details of their daily routines what 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.510
 gives us valuable information 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.550
 people wear different clothes and builds in different types of cases 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.499
 depending on the cold or heat 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.519
 Until today this has not changed 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.569
 these descriptions give us a good idea of ​​how the weather was in that 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.609
 time 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.199
 he said that the power of writing 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.879
 the scientists of today I have a sample chosen from the depths of the 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.000
 ice on the south pole 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.940
 and as never anyone who saw in practice any change in style 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.150
 would prohibit climatic conditions 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.170
 using these indications hundreds of feet deep in the ocean they 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.170
 get an idea of ​​what the world's climate was like in that period 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.629
 these changes in the weather are not completely prevented china 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.090
 some scientists think they result from specific external phenomena or 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.090
 other side of several phenomena occurring together 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.780
 the Earth's orbit around the sun changes over hundreds of millions of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.609
 years 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.249
 so the sun's rays never want to sow war in the same way 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.659
 or those that have changed most 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.509
 sometimes the volcanoes caused changes 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.739
 tons of ash from volcanic adoptions are thrown into the sky 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.339
 masking the sun's rays 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.779
 which causes the earth's temperatures to drop 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.529
 hindering the lives of all beings 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.679
 there are no doubt reasons that the logical ones for changes in the climate also 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.259
 and with the pose with the past 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.549
 the very man who is one 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.659
 some changes 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.629
 by this last action since 1850 our planet has warmed up 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:32.139
 industrialization and pollution are totally irresponsible 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.499
 but some scientists have the opportunity 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.989
 that this heating is in part a natural occurrence 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.329
 we can be in a heating cycle 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.719
 one thing is right 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.559
 a growing population 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.399
 the current moment of means of transport and communication 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.500
 all special phenomena 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.709
 periods of drought usually think second zeca urubu with the brakes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.569
 the storm is only now approaching systematic damage in a way 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.399
 can be said to be climatic accidents 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.299
 but they always occur 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.579
 anyway people learned to protect themselves from them alice monção the houses 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.430
 are built on top so that seasickness and cyclones are not flooded. 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.180
 ered with civilian materials in which they can withstand strong bursts of 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.209
 wind 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.720
 but these accidents are very important today because of their 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840
 several serious consequences 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.940
 every year they impact on thousands of people 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.430
 sometimes shaking entire regions 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.370
 these disasters are extremely difficult or even impossible to predict. 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.860
 the tests occur regularly with frequency 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.909
 and may be a sign that climates are changing deeply will lead 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.719
 many decades until we know for sure
