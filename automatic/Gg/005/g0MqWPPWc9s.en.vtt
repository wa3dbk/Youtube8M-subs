the bikes to their own standards which

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.000 
the bikes to their own standards which
were<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:14.070> than<00:00:14.580> everybody<00:00:15.269> else<00:00:16.010> the

were different than everybody else the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.769 
were different than everybody else the
bikes<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.250> everybody<00:00:17.550> else<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:17.730> making<00:00:18.119> an

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
bikes that everybody else was making an

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
bikes that everybody else was making an
example<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> quill<00:00:19.770> stem<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.670> most

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
example is the quill stem the most

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.660 
example is the quill stem the most
common<00:00:21.240> size<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.960> quill<00:00:22.680> stem<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.130> twenty-two

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
common size of quill stem is twenty-two

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060 
common size of quill stem is twenty-two
point<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.240> millimeters<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.840> diameter<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.920> on

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
point two millimeters in diameter but on

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
point two millimeters in diameter but on
french<00:00:26.369> bikes<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.240> quill<00:00:27.689> stem<00:00:27.779> diameter<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
french bikes the quill stem diameter is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.439 
french bikes the quill stem diameter is
22<00:00:28.859> millimeters<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.460> diameter<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.060> very

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
22 millimeters in diameter so very

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.889 
22 millimeters in diameter so very
slightly<00:00:30.900> smaller<00:00:31.520> also<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.059> clamp<00:00:33.360> size<00:00:33.600> on

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
slightly smaller also the clamp size on

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620 
slightly smaller also the clamp size on
the<00:00:34.320> french<00:00:34.770> quill<00:00:34.950> stems<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.790> smaller<00:00:36.180> for

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the french quill stems was smaller for

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.440 
the french quill stems was smaller for
skinnier<00:00:36.930> handlebars<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.770> what<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.450> take

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
skinnier handlebars so what I do is take

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.750 
skinnier handlebars so what I do is take
a<00:00:42.980> more<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.969> standard<00:00:45.420> quill<00:00:45.960> stem<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
a more a more standard quill stem and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
a more a more standard quill stem and
make<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> fit<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> also

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
make this fit into this and I can also

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.830 
make this fit into this and I can also
use<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.690> common<00:00:52.460> drop<00:00:53.460> bars<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.090> anyway

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
use more common drop bars on this anyway

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.189 
use more common drop bars on this anyway
I'm<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> show<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.699> take<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
I'm going to show you how to take a

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
I'm going to show you how to take a
twenty<00:00:58.199> two<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.710> millimeter<00:00:59.390> quill

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
twenty two point two millimeter quill

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.100 
twenty two point two millimeter quill
stem<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.910> fit<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
stem and make it so it will fit on a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.660 
stem and make it so it will fit on a
French<00:01:04.409> bike<00:01:05.000> now<00:01:06.000> sometimes<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> quill<00:01:08.520> stem

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
French bike now sometimes the quill stem

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
French bike now sometimes the quill stem
will<00:01:09.330> fit<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.119> worth<00:01:12.360> trying<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
will fit as is so it's worth trying the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010 
will fit as is so it's worth trying the
quill<00:01:13.380> stem<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.400> fit<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
quill stem to see if it will fit it so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
quill stem to see if it will fit it so
you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> slide<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can just kind of slide it in there

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
you can just kind of slide it in there
and<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.420> doesn't<00:01:18.659> quite<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.110> down

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and know this doesn't quite go down

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
and know this doesn't quite go down
there<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:20.610> thing<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> look<00:01:21.270> at

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
there one thing you want to look at

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.260 
there one thing you want to look at
sometimes<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.560> limiting<00:01:22.860> factor<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.030> lock

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sometimes a limiting factor is the lock

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
sometimes a limiting factor is the lock
nut<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.229> remove<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> lock<00:01:26.250> nut<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
nut on here so remove the lock nut this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.039 
nut on here so remove the lock nut this
is<00:01:26.820> already<00:01:27.060> loosened<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
is already loosened here and you the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
is already loosened here and you the
inside<00:01:31.049> diameter<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> lock<00:01:32.159> nut<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
inside diameter here at the lock nut you

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
inside diameter here at the lock nut you
want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> goes<00:01:34.200> over<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
want to see that if it goes over the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
want to see that if it goes over the
quill<00:01:35.549> stem<00:01:35.640> goes<00:01:35.909> through<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
quill stem goes through that and on this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
quill stem goes through that and on this
one<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.829> does<00:01:38.509> if<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.470> quill<00:01:40.740> stem<00:01:40.890> didn't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
one it does if the the quill stem didn't

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.740 
one it does if the the quill stem didn't
go<00:01:41.640> through<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> might<00:01:42.869> look<00:01:43.079> at<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
go through there what I might look at is

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.109 
go through there what I might look at is
maybe<00:01:46.070> grinding<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.490> bit<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
maybe grinding out a little bit just a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.749 
maybe grinding out a little bit just a
slight<00:01:48.420> bit<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.020> let<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.229> slide<00:01:49.530> through

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
slight bit in there let it slide through

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.520 
slight bit in there let it slide through
but<00:01:50.759> also<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> check<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.290> see

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but also what I want to check is to see

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.850 
but also what I want to check is to see
if<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> fits<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.369> into<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> tube<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
if this fits down into the tube here and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
if this fits down into the tube here and
it<00:01:55.860> does<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.310> slide<00:01:56.579> down<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> steerer

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it does not slide down to the steerer

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.410 
it does not slide down to the steerer
tube<00:01:57.710> another<00:01:58.710> limiting<00:01:59.460> factor<00:01:59.790> might<00:02:00.149> be

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
tube another limiting factor might be

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.069 
tube another limiting factor might be
the<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.890> wedge<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.509> might<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the the wedge here or it might be the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 
the the wedge here or it might be the
stem<00:02:04.320> itself<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
stem itself so what I want to do is I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.190 
stem itself so what I want to do is I
want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> try<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:09.060> other<00:02:09.300> stem<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.989> see

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
want to try just the other stem and see

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.510 
want to try just the other stem and see
if<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.500> fits<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> go

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
if that fits in there so I'm going to go

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.200 
if that fits in there so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
ahead and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.300 
ahead and
move<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.110> wedge<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.610> I'll<00:02:15.030> remove<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:16.310> bolt

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
move the wedge so I'll remove this bolt

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.370 
move the wedge so I'll remove this bolt
here<00:02:20.690> remove<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> out<00:02:22.110> there<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:24.110> now<00:02:25.110> just

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
here remove that out there and now just

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.510 
here remove that out there and now just
slide<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.770> down<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:28.520> that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
slide this down in there and that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.800 
slide this down in there and that
doesn't<00:02:29.880> slide<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.660> that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
doesn't slide down in there like that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.400 
doesn't slide down in there like that
but<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.740> also<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.280> check<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> wedge<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
but I can also just check the wedge and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.680 
but I can also just check the wedge and
the<00:02:34.980> wedge<00:02:35.100> goes<00:02:35.370> down<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.790> they're<00:02:35.880> fine<00:02:36.270> so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the wedge goes down and they're fine so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.810 
the wedge goes down and they're fine so
if<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.620> wedge<00:02:37.770> didn't<00:02:38.100> fit<00:02:38.280> down<00:02:38.460> in<00:02:38.670> there

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
if the wedge didn't fit down in there

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.940 
if the wedge didn't fit down in there
what<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> could<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.600> take<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> file<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
what I could do is take a file or a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
what I could do is take a file or a
grinder<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:41.670> grind<00:02:42.090> around<00:02:42.510> there<00:02:42.690> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
grinder and just grind around there a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.540 
grinder and just grind around there a
little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:44.040> would<00:02:44.220> slide<00:02:44.520> down

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
little bit so that that would slide down

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.350 
little bit so that that would slide down
in<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.260> issue<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:48.030> quill<00:02:48.210> stem

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
in there so the issue is the quill stem

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.720 
in there so the issue is the quill stem
itself<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.770> what<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:49.980> need<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:51.020> take<00:02:52.020> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
itself so what I need to do is take a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.300 
itself so what I need to do is take a
some<00:02:53.730> sandpaper<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.960> lightly<00:02:55.650> thin

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
some sandpaper and very lightly thin

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.760 
some sandpaper and very lightly thin
this<00:02:56.580> down<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.140> difference<00:02:58.620> between<00:02:58.770> a

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
this down now the difference between a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.970 
this down now the difference between a
twenty-two<00:03:01.770> point<00:03:02.010> two<00:03:02.390> millimeter<00:03:03.680> stem<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
twenty-two point two millimeter stem and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.970 
twenty-two point two millimeter stem and
a<00:03:05.100> 22<00:03:05.580> millimeter<00:03:05.940> stem<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.630> thickness<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
a 22 millimeter stem is the thickness of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.450 
a 22 millimeter stem is the thickness of
about<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.250> coke<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:10.710> I<00:03:10.740> want<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> take<00:03:11.220> just

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
about a coke can so I want to take just

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.260 
about a coke can so I want to take just
a<00:03:11.910> very<00:03:12.330> thin<00:03:12.810> layer<00:03:13.140> off<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:15.150> make

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
a very thin layer off of this just make

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.460 
a very thin layer off of this just make
a<00:03:15.300> little<00:03:15.450> bit<00:03:15.600> thinner<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.020> they'll<00:03:16.200> slide

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
a little bit thinner so they'll slide

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.010 
a little bit thinner so they'll slide
down<00:03:16.710> in<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.510> here's<00:03:18.510> my<00:03:18.660> quill<00:03:18.900> stem

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
down in there so here's my quill stem

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.530 
down in there so here's my quill stem
that<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.320> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> modify<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.210> can<00:03:21.360> see

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that I want to modify and you can see

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.800 
that I want to modify and you can see
the<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.160> minimal<00:03:23.520> insertion<00:03:24.390> line<00:03:24.570> right

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the the the minimal insertion line right

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.000 
the the the minimal insertion line right
there<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.970> want<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.960> thin<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.790> stem<00:03:31.010> at

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
there and so I want to thin the stem at

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.740 
there and so I want to thin the stem at
least<00:03:32.460> a<00:03:33.110> two<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.320> ways<00:03:34.590> above<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.750> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
least a two little ways above that and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.860 
least a two little ways above that and
so<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.380> keep<00:03:38.100> from<00:03:38.460> messing<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.390> stem

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so to keep from messing up the stem

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.470 
so to keep from messing up the stem
above<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.380> point<00:03:40.460> where<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:41.520> want<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.850> Santi

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
above that point where I want to Santi

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.110 
above that point where I want to Santi
let<00:03:42.600> me<00:03:42.660> use<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:42.960> bit<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.080> duct<00:03:43.380> tape<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
let me use a little bit of duct tape and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
let me use a little bit of duct tape and
just<00:03:45.120> wrap<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.360> around<00:03:45.570> there<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.680> maybe<00:03:47.040> I'll

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
just wrap it around there so maybe I'll

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.200 
just wrap it around there so maybe I'll
thin<00:03:47.490> it<00:03:47.640> right<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.090> about<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.570> point<00:03:48.630> there

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
thin it right to about that point there

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.580 
thin it right to about that point there
just<00:03:51.210> maybe<00:03:51.360> about<00:03:51.570> what<00:03:51.870> about<00:03:52.080> half<00:03:52.260> an<00:03:52.440> inch

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
just maybe about what about half an inch

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.410 
just maybe about what about half an inch
above<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:54.080> minimum<00:03:55.080> insertion<00:03:55.320> line<00:03:55.920> there

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
above the minimum insertion line there

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.720 
above the minimum insertion line there
and<00:03:57.420> now<00:03:58.050> what<00:03:58.200> I'm<00:03:58.260> going<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.340> I'm

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.790 
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.030> use<00:04:00.090> some<00:04:00.450> sandpaper<00:04:00.930> I'm<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.740> to

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
going to use some sandpaper I'm going to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.890 
going to use some sandpaper I'm going to
start<00:04:01.980> off<00:04:02.070> with<00:04:02.130> 80<00:04:02.580> grit<00:04:02.850> sandpaper<00:04:03.330> and

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
start off with 80 grit sandpaper and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.440 
start off with 80 grit sandpaper and
let's<00:04:06.900> see<00:04:07.110> do<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:08.340> want<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.880> wrap<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.330> around

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
let's see do I want to wrap it around

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.870 
let's see do I want to wrap it around
here<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.410> basically<00:04:10.980> just<00:04:11.430> start<00:04:11.610> sanding

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
here and basically just start sanding

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.050 
here and basically just start sanding
back<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.540> forth<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:17.700> wrap<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.910> around

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
back and forth so just wrap it around

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.590 
back and forth so just wrap it around
here<00:04:18.390> like<00:04:18.510> this

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
here like this

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.120 
here like this
and<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:19.960> just<00:04:20.230> start<00:04:22.590> sanding<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.800> back<00:04:23.920> and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
and then just start sanding it back and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.710 
and then just start sanding it back and
forth<00:04:24.310> like<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.640> like<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.270> said<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.480> want<00:04:25.630> to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
forth like this like I said I want to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.300 
forth like this like I said I want to
take<00:04:25.930> off<00:04:26.110> about<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.580> thickness<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:29.710> coke

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
take off about the thickness of a coke

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.470 
take off about the thickness of a coke
can<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:34.680> then<00:04:35.680> what<00:04:35.770> I'm<00:04:35.830> going<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:35.980> do<00:04:36.100> is

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
can and then what I'm going to do is

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.020 
can and then what I'm going to do is
periodically<00:04:37.480> test<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.550> into<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.730> fork

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
periodically test this into the fork

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.630 
periodically test this into the fork
tube<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.420> steerer<00:04:40.630> tube<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:41.380> see<00:04:41.650> if<00:04:41.980> I<00:04:42.430> have

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
tube the steerer tube to see if I have

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.270 
tube the steerer tube to see if I have
it<00:04:42.670> thin<00:04:43.180> enough<00:04:46.410> okay<00:04:47.410> I've<00:04:47.650> been<00:04:47.680> sanding

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
it thin enough okay I've been sanding

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.310 
it thin enough okay I've been sanding
this<00:04:48.400> now<00:04:48.670> with<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.060> 80<00:04:49.210> grit<00:04:49.390> sandpaper<00:04:49.720> for

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
this now with the 80 grit sandpaper for

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.390 
this now with the 80 grit sandpaper for
probably<00:04:50.950> about<00:04:51.250> 20<00:04:52.150> minutes<00:04:52.450> I<00:04:52.570> think<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:53.400> so

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
probably about 20 minutes I think and so

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.900 
probably about 20 minutes I think and so
now<00:04:54.640> this<00:04:55.360> fits<00:04:55.780> in<00:04:55.990> there<00:04:56.170> like<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.730> not<00:04:57.730> all

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
now this fits in there like that not all

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.010 
now this fits in there like that not all
the<00:04:58.000> way<00:04:58.090> up<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:58.480> tape<00:04:58.690> which<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.080> fine<00:04:59.350> but

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
the way up to the tape which is fine but

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.780 
the way up to the tape which is fine but
above<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.620> minimum<00:05:02.920> insertion<00:05:03.130> line

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
above the the minimum insertion line

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.140 
above the the minimum insertion line
there<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.590> now<00:05:05.740> what<00:05:05.890> I'm<00:05:05.950> going<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.610> I

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
I'm going to go with some lighter

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.740 
I'm going to go with some lighter
sandpaper<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.800> now<00:05:11.950> I<00:05:12.010> have<00:05:12.280> some<00:05:12.580> 220<00:05:13.510> grit

some<00:05:25.720> 600<00:05:26.200> grit<00:05:26.320> sandpaper<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.670> again<00:05:27.940> is

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
some 600 grit sandpaper this is again is

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.600 
some 600 grit sandpaper this is again is
mostly<00:05:28.420> cosmetic<00:05:28.660> because<00:05:29.440> most<00:05:30.430> of<00:05:30.520> the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
mostly cosmetic because most of the

mostly cosmetic because most of the
stuff<00:05:30.820> is<00:05:30.970> going<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.270> be<00:05:32.040> hidden<00:05:33.040> inside<00:05:33.400> the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
stuff is going to be hidden inside the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.390 
stuff is going to be hidden inside the
fork<00:05:33.880> too<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:35.080> I'm<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:35.830> gonna<00:05:35.920> do<00:05:36.040> it<00:05:36.160> anyway

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
fork too so I'm just gonna do it anyway

of<00:05:39.280> exposed<00:05:40.470> I'm<00:05:41.470> done<00:05:41.710> sanding<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.670> I<00:05:42.970> can

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
of exposed I'm done sanding so I can

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.540 
of exposed I'm done sanding so I can
take<00:05:44.260> this<00:05:44.470> duct<00:05:44.830> tape<00:05:45.070> off<00:05:45.310> here<00:05:45.820> like<00:05:49.230> that

always want to put especially with

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.320 
always want to put especially with
aluminum<00:06:23.930> stem<00:06:24.620> inside<00:06:25.129> of<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.430> steel<00:06:26.030> fork

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
aluminum stem inside of a steel fork

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.719 
aluminum stem inside of a steel fork
tube<00:06:26.539> but<00:06:27.379> always<00:06:27.889> put<00:06:28.069> a<00:06:28.099> look<00:06:28.340> at<00:06:28.430> just<00:06:28.610> a

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
tube but always put a look at just a

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:36.580 
tube but always put a look at just a
thin<00:06:29.770> coating<00:06:30.770> of<00:06:31.150> grease<00:06:32.620> around<00:06:33.620> that<00:06:35.590> to

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
thin coating of grease around that to

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.309 
thin coating of grease around that to
prevent<00:06:37.039> a<00:06:37.219> like<00:06:38.150> galvanic<00:06:38.479> corrosion<00:06:38.870> and

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
prevent a like galvanic corrosion and

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.350 
prevent a like galvanic corrosion and
stuff<00:06:39.620> in<00:06:39.830> there<00:06:40.009> and<00:06:40.879> it<00:06:41.000> just<00:06:41.150> makes<00:06:41.270> it

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
stuff in there and it just makes it

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.050 
stuff in there and it just makes it
easier<00:06:41.659> to<00:06:41.690> get<00:06:41.900> out<00:06:42.050> later<00:06:42.639> slide<00:06:43.639> this<00:06:43.819> in

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
easier to get out later slide this in
