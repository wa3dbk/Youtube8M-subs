00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello friends subscribers and friends of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.500
 youtube in this opportunity I hope with 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 a new video tutorial where to be 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 teaching how to change the format 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.610
 clock from 24 hours to 12 hours in the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.250
 systems windows 7 windows 8 8.1 and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.250
 windows 10 good let's start 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 perfect 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.960
 The first thing we have to do will be 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.110
 go to this space 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.180
 where we will click on the hour then 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.140
 let's change the configuration of 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.290
 date and time we click on change date 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.570
 and time will open a new window for us 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.750
 re we will direct to change configuration 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.810
 of the calendar later we will return to 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.440
 open a new window here we are going to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.149
 the hour tab then here in a short 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.450
 we will change the uppercase 2h and 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.219
 lowercase 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.280
 the same with the long short time but 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:32.960
 here in symbol am we will change it to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.480
 capital letters and the same with the symbol pm 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.620
 this is to make it simpler for us not 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.010
 after this we will apply and as you see 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 the format was changed 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.110
 but the am and pm symbols are not visible 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.000
 what we will do to make it visible 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 will be to give in a short leaving a space 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 two lowercase and the same with the time 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.350
 long let's apply and you'll see that the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.200
 symbol will have put on let's accept 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.960
 again apply and accept so that your 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.960
 effect and we accept all this not 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:28.620
 well this is in case of windows 7 now 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.000
 we will go to windows 8 8.1 in my case is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 a 28.1 but the same for windows 8 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.270
 again we go to this schedule 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.880
 we change the configuration we change the 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.170
 date and time and configure calendar 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.380
 we go to this tab now in a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.970
 short and now larrea we will change the h of 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.970
 uppercase and lowercase 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.700
 and the same with the symbols we're going to 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.300
 apply and so that the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.870
 pm and m symbols we will put in short time 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.130
 and long time a space we will place two 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.710
 lowercase d obviously we're not going to 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.040
 apply and they will have put 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.880
 here another detail to disappear the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.240
 zero of the beginning of each number by 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.380
 example is seven and twelve if we leave 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.220
 those two h will always be seen with a zero 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.240
 before seven if they do not want it they can 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 do the following delete an h both in 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.110
 a short as a long click on 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.810
 apply and that zero will be erased 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.470
 in my case it does not appear to me because they are already 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.650
 10 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.160
 we accept 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.630
 apply and accept 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.630
 and we have already refused to accept 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.030
 now we will do it in windows 10 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.840
 let's achieve it 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.280
 change configuration changes 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.269
 change date and time is to configure 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.110
 calendar 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.629
 we go to the tab now we will see that 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.599
 now it cuts and now it lengthens already it brings 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:36.860
 I get the 12-hour format but in 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.860
 If it's not like that, we'll configure it 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.030
 we put 2 t at the end of now short and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.460
 now long 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:54.729
 we will put the symbols in uppercase 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:59.240
 worth and here is another detail that 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:04.009
 it was not shown in windows 7 windows 8 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.050
 notice the 0 is not before the number 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:14.419
 this is because he only got so much in 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.740
 hour short as in long hour a single h 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.009
 if you reverse the video 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.350
 you will see that in windows 7 if the 0 appears 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.990
 before the number 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.670
 OK 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.890
 that's that's if the doubts are good 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.740
 friends of youtube that would be all not 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.710
