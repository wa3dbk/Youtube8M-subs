00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
around many different things in our game

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.910 
around many different things in our game
and<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.629> most<00:00:55.780> impressive<00:00:56.230> area<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.769> people

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
and the most impressive area that people

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.650 
and the most impressive area that people
are<00:00:57.160> going<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.340> see<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.670> game<00:00:57.850> users<00:00:58.269> is

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
are going to see the game users is

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.060 
are going to see the game users is
obviously<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.170> destructible<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.829> in<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
obviously the destructible is in the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.029 
obviously the destructible is in the
environment<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:02.170> an<00:01:02.289> open-world<00:01:02.649> game<00:01:02.920> it

really<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.399> impressive<00:01:03.670> what<00:01:04.000> we're<00:01:04.180> doing<00:01:04.420> in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
really is impressive what we're doing in

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.090 
really is impressive what we're doing in
the<00:01:04.600> amount<00:01:04.870> of<00:01:04.960> destructibility<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.890> player

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
the amount of destructibility the player

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.429 
the amount of destructibility the player
can<00:01:06.250> do<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.150> shoot<00:01:07.390> out<00:01:07.630> tires<00:01:08.200> on

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
can do you can shoot out tires on

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.990 
can do you can shoot out tires on
