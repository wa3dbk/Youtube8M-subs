pimping until I stick my little thing on
it<00:02:59.400> right<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.440> very<00:03:01.650> simple<00:03:01.860> model<00:03:02.190> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
it right and it's a very simple model I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.000 
it right and it's a very simple model I
did<00:03:02.730> basically<00:03:02.970> pop<00:03:03.570> two<00:03:03.810> holes<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.410> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
did basically pop two holes in it and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
did basically pop two holes in it and
that's<00:03:08.010> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
that's it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.290 
that's it
the<00:03:09.540> window<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.510> he's<00:03:12.510> thinking<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:13.080> putting

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
the window now he's thinking of putting

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.420 
the window now he's thinking of putting
120<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:16.170> turn<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.500> around<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
120 to turn this around so you can see a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.940 
120 to turn this around so you can see a
little<00:03:17.700> better<00:03:18.290> tilt<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.770> you'll

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
little better tilt it like this you'll

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
little better tilt it like this you'll
get<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.190> best<00:03:20.370> light<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:22.580> he's<00:03:23.580> thinking

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
get the best light but he's thinking

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.410 
get the best light but he's thinking
about<00:03:24.060> putting<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:25.760> 120-millimeter<00:03:26.760> Brad<00:03:27.180> here

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
upside down what that will do is block

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.870 
upside down what that will do is block
that's<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.260> little<00:03:31.530> electrical<00:03:32.069> plug<00:03:32.340> what<00:03:32.790> is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
that's a little electrical plug what is

need to fish that power cord instead of
going<00:04:12.000> through<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.390> back<00:04:12.600> because<00:04:13.049> that's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
going through the back because that's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.289

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
where the radiator go I made a little

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.560 
where the radiator go I made a little
hole<00:04:15.510> here<00:04:15.570> I'm<00:04:16.220> grommeted<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:18.030> he<00:04:18.359> can

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
hole here I'm grommeted it and he can

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.740 
hole here I'm grommeted it and he can
fishes<00:04:19.380> power<00:04:19.829> cord<00:04:20.430> off<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.850> way<00:04:21.000> you'll

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
fishes power cord off that way you'll

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.330 
fishes power cord off that way you'll
probably<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.260> use<00:04:22.440> taller<00:04:22.710> feet<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.220> do

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.779 
probably have to use taller feet to do
that<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.850> might<00:04:24.030> work<00:04:24.060> even<00:04:24.570> with<00:04:24.630> those

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789
