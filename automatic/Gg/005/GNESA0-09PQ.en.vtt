 Where it does not contain a character's big cameras 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.400
 Let's raise it 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.240
 Compared to the previous cardboard 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.750
 Camera became smaller 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.160

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.690
 Furthermore it was a box 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.690
 Looking at the outer box 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.980

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.100
 Have 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.280
 It can be google chrome 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 We first entered 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.929
 While introducing 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.929
 To provide 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.810
 I would like to comment 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 th 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 Contents are document type such as setup guide 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.509
 It becomes only the mains power supply and it is very simple 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 It is the part to insert in the body that I was worried about with the power supply 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.189
 Are using a very thin it's workplace 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.190
 You can see that the dell laptop is quite thin compared to that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.840
 Do you think 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.280
 It is the right side of the body 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.960

 There is a speaker behind 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.760
 There is a google chrome note at the top left of the body surface so at a glance 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.989
 It turns out that it is a chrome book 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.739
 The size is like this The size of the macbook air is for reference only 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.370
 I will 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:48.220
 There is a little bigger prize than macbook air by comparison 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.960
 I think 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.960
