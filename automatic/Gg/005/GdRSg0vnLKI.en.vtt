00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 so we'll explain how we change 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.020
 the strings of the seal guitar 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 usually the folk guitar is always there 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.610
 a little bit here and be black either 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 white so his first thing to do 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.950
 it 's expanding to we're going to do that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 the serious mine agreement 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 all the bodies are mounted the same apart 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 that in the treble always it is necessary that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
 the turns be inward as we 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.189
 see him here is not outside so 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.939
 all I'm going to show for 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.769
 the accord of the mig raf 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 when we do the treble did the same 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 thing but still having the sense 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 climb inward and not towards 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 outside but we relax a little bit 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.579
 rope and after like I'm a big 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 lazy 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.520
 I use this little thing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.110
 call a wheel that will serve us to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.110
 two things first at times agree 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 as soon as it starts to get enough 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.070
 relaxed actually he's going to be at 6 at the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 get out of here so in fact this is the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 thing is that after she was 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.109
 returned to summer in the little taste we 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.120
 maybe see here then we move on 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.309
 on the other side this same wheel 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 she has a little notch here that goes 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 to be very very practical to take out the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.470
 little ball here actually one has to do 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.610
 lever that is to say we go like this 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 and you have to try and that's it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.040
 of course otherwise it's not better ok then 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 with the little wheel it does not go that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.979
 really depends on the ball that we have here 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.150
 when it is a little sunken a few times 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.710
 it does not happen to eat a clamp head 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 cutting so I pass it as a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 size in fact here I am slightly 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 to not damage it 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 and here I raise a little here and there 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.780
 it's okay now it'll come all 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 alone it will be enough to shoot and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.829
 So here it comes dial that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 general rule sometimes works on 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.530
 some guitar it does not work 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.899
 better to use the wheel is less 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.549
 aggressive but if it does not work either 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.560
 in fact do you do that see the slot here 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.210
 if the shape that will then allow to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 ironing the agreement like that ie 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 actually gives me once I have 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.000
 removed I take the new rope 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.409
 in fact I'm going back home indoors 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.759
 I understand the same rope because 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.619
 the bodies are not very old and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.340
 that I will not change them for nothing 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.810
 I iron my little wheel here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.030
 and now it will be necessary now 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.709
 pressed and pull on the rope for 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.100
 that it sets itself up well it's up to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.200
 must say 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.450
 under the ball come stuck all 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.520
 this part wood here the ball she's going 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.950
 to be slightly sideways behind 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.880
 be it here then I have more 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.260
 to resume at the end of the run 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 so there since I go back the same 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.620
 rope 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:37.870
 I'm going to relax her a little 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 clear path so I'm looking to have the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:50.470
 hole right in front to put my rope 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 in and so I go in here 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.890
 I do not need the return much 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.120
 what matters is having it to have 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.770
 of the margin here that is to say it is necessary 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.980
 still we can roll up a little 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.090
 so me I believe pretty much a hand he 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.400
 must that as face almost a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.620
 hand so that when we rolled up 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.850
 so that's where it's subtle there is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.710
 full of ways to ride the bodies of a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.060
 the best way drawing that works 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.370
 so I'm showing you one that I have 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.510
 tested and that works after others 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.550
 will find other methods that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.870
 works as well why not that 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.390
 there in any case it works, that is to say 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.810
 I put a rope ride over the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.090
 rope 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.810
 when she came back which means 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.310
 that grants me 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.350
 then I will make it go 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.240
 underneath so here I am going to shake by hand 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.680
 so that we can see what is happening in 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.390
 do my little piece of rope here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.060
 what is when the agreement of na'vi more 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.650
 long we will cut that then people roll 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.400
 and now I spend this little bit of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.230
 rope over the rest of the rope that 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.160
 people are rolling underneath that and 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.570
 now I have more than wait 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.540
 to the end so here now we 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.340
 take the wheel and we will tighten I 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.220
 hold on at the same time with my index finger 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.830
 and with my fingers here the rope stretched 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.270
 for it to set up well as 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.430
 we must also pay attention to 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.020
 6th to the knight finally too and from 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.940
 knights that the agreement is well in 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.480
 place on once the original case is 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.520
 puts all alone 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.470
 and then I'm still rolling 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.470
 until okay is tense 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 be careful of the rope 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.449
 here as it is extension on the rope 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.549
 when the agreement of the nine it comes out a 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.440
 little so well keep him tense plays a 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.729
 little to the bow to check that 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 the attention be good it does not stay anymore 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.880
 than 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.199
 check my tuning go back over 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.150
 children should not be confined to the beginning 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:44.099
 it serves as the rope age but it goes 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.509
 definitely move a little bit in 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.870
 reproduces the same thing for all 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.250
 ropes 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.509
 if we want to clean the handle of the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.610
 guitar times all the strings a 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.590
 shortly after we finish it fell 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.509
 completely here and here so do it right 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.430
 be careful to spot each of the little ones 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.900
 trees because they took a little the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.460
 size of different rope 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.680
 so it's better to put them back in 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.629
 the same positions one can clean his 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.610
 sleeve using a product for 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.960
 guitar and then well remember here between 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.969
 least she could do for 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.969
 that I do it 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.969
 here
