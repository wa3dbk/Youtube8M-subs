00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that they can unify their videos into

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.410 
that they can unify their videos into
their<00:01:54.030> ipod<00:01:55.310> application<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.090> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
their ipod application so it's all one

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.429 
their ipod application so it's all one
and<00:01:57.799> yeah<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.250> can't<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.759> enable<00:02:00.570> HDR

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and yeah so you can't really enable HDR

and yeah so you can't really enable HDR
on<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.909> iphone<00:02:03.649> 3g<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.850> can't<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
on the iphone 3g and you can't do and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.630 
on the iphone 3g and you can't do and
this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.280> very<00:02:08.489> good<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> iphone<00:02:10.800> 3g<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this is very good for the iphone 3g and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.809 
this is very good for the iphone 3g and
2g

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
2g

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.360 
2g
so<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.299> they<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.719> easily<00:02:14.140> disable<00:02:14.499> a<00:02:14.920> home

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so that they can easily disable a home

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.610 
so that they can easily disable a home
screen<00:02:15.700> wallpaper<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.510> multitasking<00:02:16.870> to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
screen wallpaper and multitasking to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.890 
screen wallpaper and multitasking to
make<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.950> device<00:02:18.099> their<00:02:18.579> devices<00:02:18.909> run<00:02:19.299> faster

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
make the device their devices run faster

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.289 
make the device their devices run faster
so<00:02:20.439> this<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.920> very<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.430> cydia<00:02:21.999> tweak

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
so this is a very good cydia tweak

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.080 
so this is a very good cydia tweak
overall<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.049> find<00:02:23.469> this<00:02:23.829> treat<00:02:24.159> very<00:02:24.489> useful<00:02:24.909> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
overall I find this treat very useful to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.239 
overall I find this treat very useful to
speed<00:02:25.359> up<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.629> device<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.620> simply<00:02:26.920> can

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
speed up your device so you simply can

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.539 
speed up your device so you simply can
change<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.239> toggle<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.840> example<00:02:29.439> a<00:02:29.680> unified

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
change a toggle for example a unified

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.110 
change a toggle for example a unified
