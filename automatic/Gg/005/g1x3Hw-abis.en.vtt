00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
for this reason we highly recommend that
you<00:01:37.290> store<00:01:37.680> your<00:01:37.829> images<00:01:38.280> within<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> same

this<00:02:55.799> means<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> stored<00:02:56.760> travel

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
this means that if you stored travel

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.630 
this means that if you stored travel
photos<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.720> say<00:02:58.109> a<00:02:58.140> travel<00:02:58.709> photo<00:02:58.890> catalog<00:02:59.430> and

you<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.190> only<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.790> access<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.750> one<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.319> those

catalogs<00:03:05.129> at<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.549> time<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.599> basically<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.260> you

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
catalogs at one time so basically if you

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.080 
catalogs at one time so basically if you
are<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.859> travel<00:03:08.250> catalog<00:03:08.609> or<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.849> think<00:03:09.030> the

are in the travel catalog or I think the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.880 
are in the travel catalog or I think the
