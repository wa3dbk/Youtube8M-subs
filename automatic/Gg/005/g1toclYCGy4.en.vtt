so<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> far<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.149> base<00:02:03.479> challenge<00:02:04.020> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so so far so good the base challenge is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.609 
so so far so good the base challenge is
getting<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.920> water<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.619> half

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
getting in my water you have to do half

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.290 
getting in my water you have to do half
your<00:02:07.920> weight<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.429> ounces

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
your weight in ounces

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.740 
your weight in ounces
so<00:02:09.870> that<00:02:10.290> means<00:02:10.470> 91<00:02:11.040> ounces<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.580> water<00:02:11.820> that's

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
so that means 91 ounces of water that's

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.020 
so that means 91 ounces of water that's
been<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.470> biggest<00:02:13.620> challenge<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.550> me<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
