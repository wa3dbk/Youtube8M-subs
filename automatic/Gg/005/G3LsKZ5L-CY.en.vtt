objects<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.899> came<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.440> basically<00:00:49.920> two

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
objects we came up with basically two

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
objects we came up with basically two
cans<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> soda<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.059> mean<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cans of soda I mean this is about the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
cans of soda I mean this is about the
weight<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.890> course<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.309> distributed<00:00:53.789> across

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
weight of course it's distributed across

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
weight of course it's distributed across
in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> 13-inch<00:00:55.230> three<00:00:55.469> screen<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.430> even

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
in a 13-inch three screen so it's even

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
in a 13-inch three screen so it's even
though<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> feels<00:00:57.239> lighter<00:00:57.600> weight<00:00:57.840> than<00:00:57.989> even

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
though it feels lighter weight than even

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
though it feels lighter weight than even
the<00:00:58.260> cans<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> soda<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.030> close

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the cans of soda that's about as close

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
the cans of soda that's about as close
as<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.629> get<00:01:00.809> from<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.109> approximate<00:01:01.559> weight

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
as we can get from an approximate weight

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
as we can get from an approximate weight
perspective<00:01:02.690> exciting<00:01:03.690> things<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:03.930> this
