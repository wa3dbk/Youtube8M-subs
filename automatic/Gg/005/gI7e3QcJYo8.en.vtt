on<00:00:09.290> here<00:00:09.620> three<00:00:09.980> cell<00:00:10.220> batteries<00:00:10.700> freshly

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
on here three cell batteries freshly

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.629 
on here three cell batteries freshly
recharged<00:00:11.809> cars<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.950> I<00:00:13.010> just<00:00:13.219> took<00:00:13.309> it<00:00:13.460> for<00:00:13.549> a

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
recharged cars and I just took it for a

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.220 
recharged cars and I just took it for a
little<00:00:13.879> tiny<00:00:14.030> spin<00:00:14.360> before<00:00:14.540> putting<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.050> on

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
little tiny spin before putting this on

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.170 
little tiny spin before putting this on
camera<00:00:15.470> and<00:00:16.099> it<00:00:16.250> actually<00:00:16.430> did<00:00:16.760> improve<00:00:17.029> the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
camera and it actually did improve the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.179 
camera and it actually did improve the
speed<00:00:17.420> just<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.960> little<00:00:18.349> bit<00:00:18.500> more<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.160> I

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
speed just a little bit more so I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.730 
speed just a little bit more so I
thought<00:00:19.759> I'd<00:00:19.880> show<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:20.090> guys<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.720> check<00:00:21.529> her

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740

as<00:01:34.180> far<00:01:34.420> as<00:01:34.450> reverse<00:01:34.900> goes

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.639 

reverse<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.689> great<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
reverse is not that great with a

00:01:40.649 --> 00:02:04.690 
reverse is not that great with a
three-bladed<00:01:41.159> proc

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.059 

grab<00:02:05.700> some<00:02:05.910> more<00:02:06.000> grass<00:02:06.300> again

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.800 

it's<00:02:09.519> only<00:02:09.700> problem<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.239> playing<00:02:10.450> at<00:02:10.629> this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it's only problem with playing at this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:23.220 
it's only problem with playing at this
part<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> beach

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.089 

anyways<00:02:23.980> guys<00:02:24.190> let<00:02:25.000> me<00:02:25.030> know<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.360> think

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
anyways guys let me know what you think

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.130 
anyways guys let me know what you think
that<00:02:27.099> gets<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.370> little<00:02:27.550> bit<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:28.180> extra<00:02:28.480> speed<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that gets a little bit of extra speed I

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
that gets a little bit of extra speed I
mean<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.500> not<00:02:29.680> watch<00:02:29.980> over<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.459> tube<00:02:30.640> blade

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
mean it's not watch over the tube blade

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.910 
mean it's not watch over the tube blade
so<00:02:31.780> I'll<00:02:31.870> probably<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.319> stick<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.769> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so I'll probably just stick with the to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.030 
so I'll probably just stick with the to
play<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.190> crop<00:02:33.550> anyhow<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.300> thing<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.680> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
was definitely a little thing to try it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.530
