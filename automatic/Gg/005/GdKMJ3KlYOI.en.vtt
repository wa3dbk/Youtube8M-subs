00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the first point being you know this is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
the first point being you know this is
Freddie's<00:01:04.409> hat<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> obviously<00:01:05.610> links

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
Freddie's hat so this is obviously links

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550 
Freddie's hat so this is obviously links
to<00:01:06.299> Freddie<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.049> mean<00:01:07.260> Freddie

to Freddie so does this mean Freddie
lives<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.070> exactly<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> mean<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> hats<00:01:09.330> gone

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
lives on exactly I mean the hats gone

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
lives on exactly I mean the hats gone
who's<00:01:09.930> taking<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> question<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.130> that's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
who's taking it the question is that's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
who's taking it the question is that's
exactly<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.510> most<00:01:12.900> people<00:01:13.080> know

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
exactly and I think most people know

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
exactly and I think most people know
that<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.860> course<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> Freddie<00:01:14.580> signature

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that of course this is Freddie signature

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
that of course this is Freddie signature
hat<00:01:15.390> isn't<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> yes<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> Hat

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
hat isn't it yes so you know the Hat

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
hat isn't it yes so you know the Hat
could<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.030> taken<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.900> definitely<00:01:19.439> think

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
could be taken and I definitely think

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
could be taken and I definitely think
it's<00:01:19.740> image<00:01:19.950> represents<00:01:20.460> something<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's image represents something in the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's image represents something in the
future<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.420> mean<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> hats<00:01:21.869> sitting<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
future I mean the hats sitting in the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
future I mean the hats sitting in the
same<00:01:22.710> spot<00:01:22.890> light<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.880> gone

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
same spot light and now it's gone

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
same spot light and now it's gone
someone<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:24.900> taken<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.860> Freddie

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
someone has taken it and if it's Freddie

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
someone has taken it and if it's Freddie

this could mean quite a few new exciting

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
was it at very interesting point indeed

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.710 
was it at very interesting point indeed
I<00:01:43.619> mean<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.399> didn't<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> Hat<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> you

I mean we didn't see the Hat and you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.060 
I mean we didn't see the Hat and you
know<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> Hat<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.320> been<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> spotlight

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
know the Hat then been in the spotlight

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.620 
know the Hat then been in the spotlight
on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> website<00:01:47.820> could<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.180> linked<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
on the website could this be linked it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
on the website could this be linked it
kinda<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.110> same<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:50.070> frame<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> suppose

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
kinda like a same time frame I suppose

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.649 
kinda like a same time frame I suppose
you<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:50.970> say<00:01:51.000> could<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> spotlight

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you could say could the spotlight

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
you could say could the spotlight
represent<00:01:52.049> something<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> same<00:01:52.590> time<00:01:52.770> or

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
represent something in the same time or

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.289 
represent something in the same time or
could<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> hat<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.939> been<00:01:53.970> put<00:01:54.210> on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
could the hat have just not been put on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
could the hat have just not been put on
Freddie<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.960> such<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.320> important

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
Freddie because it's such an important

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
Freddie because it's such an important
relic<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> five<00:01:56.490> nights<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.820> Freddy's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
relic to the five nights at Freddy's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
relic to the five nights at Freddy's
franchise<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> risk<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
franchise that you know the risk of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
franchise that you know the risk of
someone<00:01:58.920> sitting<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.490> too<00:01:59.670> great

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
someone sitting it was too great

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.209 
someone sitting it was too great
yeah<00:02:00.659> while<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.200> thinking<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.680> phantom

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
yeah while all this thinking a phantom

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190 
yeah while all this thinking a phantom
Freddy<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> hat<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.450> yes<00:02:04.049> he

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
Freddy doesn't he have a hat on yes he

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.870 
Freddy doesn't he have a hat on yes he
does<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.460> suppose<00:02:05.790> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
does actually but I think I suppose this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
does actually but I think I suppose this
cuz<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> could<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> two<00:02:06.780> ways<00:02:06.930> we've

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
cuz this could go one of two ways we've

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
cuz this could go one of two ways we've
made<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> video<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.740> phantom<00:02:08.520> Freddy

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
made a video about phantom Freddy

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
made a video about phantom Freddy
possibly<00:02:09.300> being<00:02:09.509> real<00:02:09.899> Burt<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> he's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
possibly being real Burt and he's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
possibly being real Burt and he's
wearing<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> hats<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> course<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:11.970> if

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
wearing the hats of course but if

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
wearing the hats of course but if
is<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> phantom<00:02:13.110> coat<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.590> could<00:02:13.739> also

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is a phantom coat so that could also

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
is a phantom coat so that could also
mean<00:02:14.190> he's<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> hallucination<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.209> yeah<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.900> he

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
mean he's a hallucination so yeah and he

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.290 
mean he's a hallucination so yeah and he
doesn't<00:02:16.200> exist<00:02:16.650> exactly<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> could<00:02:18.150> go

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
doesn't exist exactly so this could go

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.670 
doesn't exist exactly so this could go
one<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.540> two<00:02:18.569> ways<00:02:18.780> saying<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.319> though<00:02:19.530> in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
one of two ways saying that though in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.229 
one of two ways saying that though in
the<00:02:19.769> bottom<00:02:20.099> left<00:02:20.280> hand<00:02:20.370> side<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.819> your<00:02:20.849> office

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
the bottom left hand side of your office

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.580 
the bottom left hand side of your office
when<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> Freddy<00:02:21.690> sits<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> one<00:02:22.440> does

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
when the Freddy sits there that one does

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.770 
when the Freddy sits there that one does
actually<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> hat<00:02:23.280> doesn't<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.700> yes<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
actually have a hat doesn't it yes so it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.059 
actually have a hat doesn't it yes so it
could<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.110> linked<00:02:25.290> towards<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.800> Freddy

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
could be linked towards that Freddy

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.770 
could be linked towards that Freddy
Moore<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.400> particular<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.390> another

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
Moore in particular now I think another

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.300 
Moore in particular now I think another
way<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.379> could<00:02:28.470> actually<00:02:28.590> look<00:02:28.769> at<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.130> if

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
way we could actually look at this is if

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430 
way we could actually look at this is if
you<00:02:29.430> beat<00:02:29.640> 96<00:02:30.209> or<00:02:30.360> nightmare<00:02:30.989> mode<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.290> five

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
you beat 96 or nightmare mode in five

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
you beat 96 or nightmare mode in five
nights<00:02:31.650> at<00:02:31.739> Freddy's<00:02:31.980> 3<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.459> actually<00:02:32.700> are

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
nights at Freddy's 3 you actually are

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.580

oh<00:02:39.840> yes<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.799> could<00:02:41.010> possibly<00:02:41.160> mean<00:02:41.640> that

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
oh yes so this could possibly mean that

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
almost out for auction now the fact that

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.460 
almost out for auction now the fact that
this<00:02:56.790> hat<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.209> no<00:02:57.420> longer<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.290> could

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this hat is no longer here this could

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.839 
this hat is no longer here this could
mean<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> Hat<00:02:59.010> has<00:02:59.190> actually<00:02:59.489> been<00:02:59.579> sold

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
is where it gets a little bit tricky I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.470 
is where it gets a little bit tricky I
suppose<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:08.579> now<00:03:08.790> there's<00:03:09.150> been<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.420> lot

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
Scott's promoting the film or if he's

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.840 
Scott's promoting the film or if he's
promoting<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> game<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.160> yeah<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.760> very

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
promoting the game but yeah it's very

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.360 
promoting the game but yeah it's very
hard<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> tell<00:03:36.569> exactly<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.560> mean<00:03:37.739> it's

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
hard to tell exactly and I mean it's

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.349 
hard to tell exactly and I mean it's
going<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> be<00:03:38.700> one<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:38.940> those<00:03:39.030> things<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.329> think

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
going to be one of those things I think

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.660 
going to be one of those things I think
and<00:03:39.630> until<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:39.959> kind<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:40.829> possibly<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> few

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and until we kind of see possibly a few

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.069 
and until we kind of see possibly a few
more<00:03:41.819> teasers<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.269> Scott<00:03:42.600> may<00:03:42.720> release<00:03:42.959> I

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
more teasers that Scott may release I

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.629 
more teasers that Scott may release I
think<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.380> might<00:03:43.560> solidify<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.579> of

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
think it might solidify the kind of

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.979 
think it might solidify the kind of
message<00:03:44.910> we<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.389> either<00:03:45.540> way<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.930> is

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
message we get but either way this is

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.780 
message we get but either way this is
actually<00:03:46.139> really<00:03:46.620> exciting<00:03:47.100> Scott<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.519> still
