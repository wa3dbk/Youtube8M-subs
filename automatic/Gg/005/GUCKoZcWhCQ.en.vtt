we've made a lot of changes your bike
this<00:00:33.390> year<00:00:33.629> and<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.410> excited<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.800> tell<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this year and I'm excited to tell you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
this year and I'm excited to tell you
all<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.609> into<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.850> all

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
all about it so let's get into it all

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.080 
all about it so let's get into it all
right<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.629> go

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.210 

for<00:00:39.690> starters<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.290> engineers<00:00:40.740> looked<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.130> the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
for starters the engineers looked at the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.740 
for starters the engineers looked at the
engine<00:00:41.550> whether<00:00:41.880> they<00:00:41.940> revised<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> intake

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
engine whether they revised the intake

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
engine whether they revised the intake
track<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.560> on<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> larger<00:00:43.980> carburetor<00:00:44.430> bore

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
track put on a larger carburetor bore

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
track put on a larger carburetor bore
and<00:00:44.970> also<00:00:45.570> revised<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.080> CDI<00:00:46.380> ignition<00:00:46.800> method

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and also revised the CDI ignition method

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.530 
and also revised the CDI ignition method
so<00:00:47.370> Ryan<00:00:47.580> what<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.790> these<00:00:47.850> changes<00:00:48.210> mean<00:00:48.300> for

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
so Ryan what are these changes mean for

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.510 
so Ryan what are these changes mean for
you<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> track<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:50.010> power<00:00:50.280> coming

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you out at the track more power coming

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.070 
you out at the track more power coming
out<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.790> hole<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.090> sure<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.990> new

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
out of the hole for sure and the new

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.600 
out of the hole for sure and the new
carburetor<00:00:52.380> helped<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> pull<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.130> the<00:00:53.520> way

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
carburetor helped to pull all the way

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
carburetor helped to pull all the way
the<00:00:53.820> first<00:00:54.060> time<00:00:54.270> searching<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.440> even<00:00:55.530> more

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the first time searching for even more

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
the first time searching for even more
power<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.550> shaved<00:00:56.880> weight<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.480> new

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
power they shaved weight with a new

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.780 
power they shaved weight with a new
lighter<00:00:57.930> piston<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.590> ranks<00:00:58.980> reducing

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
lighter piston and ranks reducing

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.460 
lighter piston and ranks reducing
friction<00:01:00.000> allowing<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> engine<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> rev

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
friction allowing the engine to rev

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.220 
friction allowing the engine to rev
freer<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:02.130> quicker<00:01:02.490> from<00:01:02.940> 8,000<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.540> 11000

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
freer and quicker from 8,000 to 11000

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.350 
freer and quicker from 8,000 to 11000
rpm<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.949> new<00:01:05.130> bike<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.670> comes<00:01:05.880> alive<00:01:06.120> as

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
rpm this new bike really comes alive as

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
rpm this new bike really comes alive as
soon<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.050> gas<00:01:07.230> we<00:01:08.070> optimized

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
soon as you get on the gas we optimized

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.620 
soon as you get on the gas we optimized
the<00:01:08.610> crankshaft<00:01:08.880> balance<00:01:09.420> basically

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the crankshaft balance basically

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
the crankshaft balance basically
reducing<00:01:10.140> both<00:01:10.260> friction<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> vibration

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
reducing both friction and vibration

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
reducing both friction and vibration
basically<00:01:11.910> putting<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> power<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.720> where

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
basically putting the power right where

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
basically putting the power right where
you<00:01:13.050> want<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> directly<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> rear<00:01:14.130> wheel

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you want it directly to the rear wheel

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
you want it directly to the rear wheel
it's<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.970> important<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.750> those

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's really important when it and those

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.219 
it's really important when it and those
big<00:01:16.110> triples<00:01:16.619> come<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.010> corners<00:01:18.229> next

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
big triples come out of corners next

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.540 
big triples come out of corners next
they<00:01:19.320> looked<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.619> ways<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.010> increase<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
they looked at ways to increase the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.460 
they looked at ways to increase the
lateral<00:01:21.000> longitudinal<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.080> torsional

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
lateral longitudinal and torsional

straightaways next they increase the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.680 
straightaways next they increase the
