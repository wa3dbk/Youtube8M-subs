00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.140
[Red Bull BC ONE Spain Cypher]

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.681
<i>Barcelona was one of the cities</i>

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.659
<i>where the Breakdance movement
started here in Spain.</i>

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.853
<i>The origin, that mythical place
in Barcelona was Plaza Universitat.</i>

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:14.906
<i>Over a hundred Bboys
used to gather there to train</i>

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:16.936
and they were the ones
who created all of this.

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:19.135
We are all indirectly connected to this.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.755
Although we don't know
each other personally,

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.153
I think we really learn a lot

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:24.687
from the old-schoolers
who have gone through here

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.516
and all over Spain.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.837
The new generations
come to take the baton

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:30.765
to face off tonight in the final

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.732
of the Red Bull BC One.
We'll see who takes it.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:44.269
(Music)(Cheer)

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.484
Barcelona, are you ready?
Let it go!

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:55.049
(Music)

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.934
It's important 
to notice the great ones in this,

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.569
those who made it real.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.178
The knowledge they've given us

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:04.761
must be handed forward
to the next generation.

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:07.792
This is a chain, a cycle,
and those who come after

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.412
will pull from us, but always 
keeping respect for the pioneers,

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:13.354
who are the ones who were
above all others

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.248
when the scene appeared in Spain.

00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:20.782
(Music)

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:23.448
I'm happy because what's scariest

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:25.519
in these championships is tiredness,

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.940
but I'm not getting tired, so...

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.841
I'm fine, really,
so let's see if this roll goes on.

00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:36.907
OK! Now, there are only four left!

00:01:36.907 --> 00:02:03.373
(Music)

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:10.310
Let's go with what everybody
was waiting for,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.761
the big final! Noise!

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:18.102
There's always tension backstage,

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:19.649
but when you go out on the floor,

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.694
you forget about all that
and focus on the music,

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.842
on the floor, on your opponent,
and on doing your best.

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:28.990
(Cheer)

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.619
At the moment when the battle begins,
that nervousness vanishes.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.582
This is what I enjoy.
That's why I keep doing it,

00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:36.361
and I've been doing battles for 14 years.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.735
The grand final, let's go!

00:02:38.735 --> 00:03:16.999
(Music)

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:22.475
We are writing the history of breaking.

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:26.166
You pick up the baton,
and when you hand it off,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.898
the baton must be bigger.

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.553
See you on October third

00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:33.367
at the great European final in Madrid.

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:37.271
(Music)
