my<00:00:11.280> general<00:00:11.969> impression<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.690> it's

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
my general impression I think it's

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.470

really<00:00:13.860> good<00:00:14.100> really<00:00:14.309> positive<00:00:14.850> and<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.360> are

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
really good really positive and we are

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.760 
really good really positive and we are
always<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.020> constant<00:00:16.710> development<00:00:17.520> also

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
always in constant development also

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.349 
always in constant development also
improving<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.310> think<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.940> team<00:00:21.119> it's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
improving a lot I think the team it's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.210 
improving a lot I think the team it's
really<00:00:21.510> new<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
really new but we have a lot of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.929 
really new but we have a lot of
qualities<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.470> we<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.009> talent

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
qualities we are we have a lot of talent

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.099 
qualities we are we have a lot of talent
I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> things<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I think all the things have a lot of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.560 
I think all the things have a lot of
talent<00:00:28.589> so<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.609> time<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.029> work<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
talent so just we need time to work and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
talent so just we need time to work and
try<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> understand<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> device<00:00:32.369> needs

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
try to understand what the device needs

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.270 
try to understand what the device needs
of<00:00:33.150> course<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.830> moment<00:00:35.010> we

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of course I think that at the moment we

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
of course I think that at the moment we
have<00:00:35.400> a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> improve<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.900> quite

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.560 

think<00:02:42.270> my<00:02:42.630> goal<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.350> same<00:02:44.010> try<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.270> all<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
think my goal is same try to be all the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.660 
think my goal is same try to be all the
time<00:02:45.750> into<00:02:45.930> top-10<00:02:46.440> try<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> learn<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.160> lot<00:02:47.280> of

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
time into top-10 try to learn a lot of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.610 
time into top-10 try to learn a lot of
course<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.209> would<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.230> front

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
course I would like to be more in front

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.949 
course I would like to be more in front
everyone<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.360> working<00:02:51.630> hard

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
everyone more but we are working hard

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.650 
everyone more but we are working hard
and<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.500> think<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.060> second<00:02:54.390> part<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and I think that in the second part of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.600 
and I think that in the second part of
the<00:02:54.810> season<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.560> they<00:02:55.920> are<00:02:56.040> coming<00:02:56.310> from

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the season and they are coming from

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.120 
the season and they are coming from
something<00:02:57.300> new<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> bike<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.290> day<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
something new for the bike on day on the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.850 
something new for the bike on day on the
engine<00:02:59.430> area<00:02:59.610> we<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> good<00:03:00.840> job<00:03:01.080> of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
engine area we can make a good job of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.830 
engine area we can make a good job of
course<00:03:02.220> sometimes<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.239> difficult<00:03:03.720> but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
course sometimes will be difficult but

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.690 
course sometimes will be difficult but
all<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.350> tracks<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:05.280> positive

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
all the tracks can be really positive

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.220 
all the tracks can be really positive
for<00:03:05.850> our<00:03:05.970> salute<00:03:09.380> Suzuki<00:03:10.380> way<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.920> life
