00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
sangria paint and I ended up using just

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.990 
sangria paint and I ended up using just
the<00:03:09.900> regular<00:03:10.050> blue<00:03:10.680> tape<00:03:11.129> that<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.610> use<00:03:11.790> for

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the regular blue tape that you use for

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.839 
the regular blue tape that you use for
painting<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:13.110> sketched<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.709> how<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> would

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
painting and I sketched out how I would

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.780 
painting and I sketched out how I would
like<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.209> squares<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.220> laid<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> tape<00:03:17.580> down

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
like the squares and laid the tape down

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.240 
like the squares and laid the tape down
and<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.150> painted<00:03:18.510> between<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.830> think

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
and just painted between it and I think

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.309 
and just painted between it and I think
the<00:03:20.580> added<00:03:20.730> bonus<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.450> these<00:03:21.989> little

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
the added bonus is that these little

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.059 
the added bonus is that these little
pieces<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.799> our<00:03:23.040> look<00:03:23.730> more<00:03:24.420> grand<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.319> the
