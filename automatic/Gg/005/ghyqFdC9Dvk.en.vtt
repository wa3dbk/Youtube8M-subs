00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.420
 good as lava the day here we have what 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.269
 which is the router the cbn of the company that 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.869
 it's put in bridge mode what we 're going 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.690
 to do 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.010
 I go back to the first show that is in 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:24.439
 bridge mode 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:27.070
 that's 192 points 168 points 100.1 more or 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.720
 less the same as before was 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:37.460
 192 16 8.1.1 now they just change what's 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.560
 that put the number 2100 point one what 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.080
 same we give to the inter we are going to see 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.430
 exactly the same as before the only thing 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.310
 what 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.250
 you realize because you already appear alone 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.830
 the cable modem already disappeared kakÃ¡ 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.000
 we always had two drawings 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.920
 of modem and another router 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 you can also enter it gives you some 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.470
 information but good is a modem 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.500
 we can not ask for much 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.300
 admin admin does not change anything that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.120
 the router's drawing appears but it is 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.260
 just for us to enter there and instead of 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.820
 do what is the hard reset 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:25.540
 that I showed in the previous video you do 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.580
 directly from from here then 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.370
 we only put in talks we give to 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.440
 apply will restart and it will be 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.280
 a router but this is not the case 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.280
 only 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 to show 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.060
 let say 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.430
 the modern or the cbn 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.740
 The only thing that will show you when you are 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.009
 put in model is the same as another 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.789
 model is going to show you what the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.590
 the signs good nothing practically 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.110
 nothing nothing that interests you you do not have 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 no configuration I can say 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.619
 why am I going to modify this or what 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.890
 another is a modem that is what it has is 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.679
 good to put a modem what we're going to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.980
 do in this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.430
 to accommodate an example close session 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.689
 we know that when we put the 192 168 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.879
 100.1 points and we give the enter and we see 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:26.799
 this where we know that this is in mode 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:28.959
 pointer no bridge then now what 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.849
 we're going to do is test it and to 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.530
 test what we do a test of 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.290
 speed 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.780
 That always 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.350
 your services 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 point 1 point is bar 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800
 your 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.460
 and speed we give 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.920
 and let's go to what is the test 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 speed of or we will not give 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.230
 continue 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.930
 let's see does not exactly have the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.290
 same speed 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.359
 and it does not have to give problems if it is 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.909
 true that sometimes some routers 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.310
 they can have some be an error of 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.780
 firmware in the operating system that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.500
 they have to when you put it in a mode 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.370
 bridge the performance at speed not 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.659
 be the same 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.540
 but that's very, very rare things very 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.069
 rare that are with a case of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.349
 but it is in case the doubts 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.510
 just to show that it's 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.959
 in bridge mode that works and that the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.040
 speed is always the same I will 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.190
 bring this closer to the bad results 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.750
 ping 5 milliseconds download speed 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.159
 at 50 megabytes and the upload speed by 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.150
 what I'm seeing this anthem this 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:55.120
 here is going to be also 5 megabytes to these 50 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.760
 mb good and I did complete 50 mb of 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.980
 download with 5 megabytes of upload and a pin of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.980
 5 milliseconds well this is barbarian
